Rockefeller chapel illuminated by floodlights, which shone for
the first time this year during the performance of “The Messiah”
Sunday.

Illumination of Rockefeller becomes

permanent evening feature on campus

Permanent lighting which illuminates the exterior of Rockefeller chapel was used for the
first time Sunday.

The illumination greeted the audience leaving the annual performance of Handel’s Messiah
by the UC choir Sunday evening. Hereafter from dusk to 11 p.m. nightly, the lighting, planned
to emphasize the modeling of the structure, will be turned on.

The lighting of the chapel, masterpiece of the late Chicago architect, Bertram Grosvenor

Goodhue, has been installed to
extend the intention of John
D. Rockefeller, founder of the
University, that the chapel be
the central and dominant fea-

ture of the
rangles.

Rockefeller
sire when he

University quad-

expressed this de-
made his final per-

sonal gift of $10 million in 1910,
in which he made provision for
the chapel.

“As the spirit of religion should
penetrate and control the Uni-
versity, so that building which
represents religion ought to be
the central and dominant feature
of the University group,” he
wrote. “Thus it will be proclaimed
that the University in its ideal is
dominated by the spirit of relig-
ion, all of its departments are in-
spired by religious feeling, and
all its work is directed to the high-
est ends.”

Rockefeller chapel, which cost
approximately $1,900,000 was dedi-
cated October 28. 1928. Of true
Gothic construction, it is an ir-
regular cruciform building 265
feet long and 120 feet wide, with
a tower rising 207 feet.

One notable feature of the deco-
ration is the series of figures rep-
resenting the march of religion,
which fills the gable on the south,
or Midway, front of the chapel.

Kiendl to replace
Birenbaum as
activities director

William Birenbaum leaves
his post as director of student
activities January 1 to become
dean of students at the down-
town University college. Replac-
ing him is Arthur Kiendl, present
director of the University house
system. Kiendl will continue to
head the house system.

Birenbaum has been director of
student activities since 1950. A
student in the law school, he was
graduated in 1949.

Kiendl became director of the
house system just this quarter.
I le was assistant dean and direc-
tor of counseling at Dartmouth
(allege before coming to UC,
where he is also working on his
doctorate in cortege administra-
tion.

Kiendl is a native of New Jer-
sey and attended West Point and
Dartmouth. He is a graduate of
Dartmouth.

Harvey denies fraud

calls SECC stooge'

“The South East commission is a stooge for the University
of Chicago under the most vicious snob I have ever met,’’
Aiderman William Harvey declared in the city council hous-
ing and planning committee meeting Wednesday. Harvey, who
apparently was referring to Julian Levy, director of the South
East Chicago commission, also denied that the pictures he

had displayed the previous
week were designed to per-
petrate a fraud.

Last week, Harvey showed
pictures of 12 homes which he
alleged were in the area to be
torn down. Later the Sun-Times
reported that only one of the
homes was in the area. Harvey
said Wednesday that all but two
of the homes arg in the redevelop-
ment area, and that the other two
homes got in by an honest mis-
take on the part of a photogra-
pher who had trouble following
the irregular outlines of the area
of the Hyde Park redevelopment
project, involving 47 acres be-
tween Kimbark and Lake Park
avenues, 53rd and 57th streets.

Sewall Wright, Ernest D. Burton distinguished professor of zoology and world-famous
geneticist, will become professor emeritus of UC on December 31. Wright will leave UC and
take up residence at the University of Wisconsin, where he plans to continue research and
writing and do a small amount of teaching.

Wright has been on the UC faculty since 1926.

Wright’s major contributions to the field of genetics have been his studies of the breed-

ing and coat characters of
guinea pigs and his determin-

Dirty windows unhealthy

The administration will continue with plans to clean Hutch-
inson Commons during the Christmas interim, said W. B.
Harrell, vice-president of the University. Representatives of
student government, opposing the project, estimate that it

will cost from five to eight
denies this.

“This money is coming from
somewhere and I’m certain it
could be used better else-
where,” maintained Al Fortier,
SG president. It has been suggest-
ed by Fortier that improvement
of the overcrowded C-shop and
the inadequate Reynolds club fa-
cilities would be of greater imme-
diate service to the student body.

Administration wants opinion

Harrell explained that the ad-
ministration is interested in stu-
dent opinion on the project, and
the cleaning of .the Commons
would not preclude other improve-
ments in the Commons-C-shop
area.

“Any saving is a start,” accord-
ing to Anton DePorte, who also
pointed out that “They’ve even
stopped printing the thesis topics
after grade names in the pro-
grams.”

At the suggestion of Dean
Strozier, a committee composed
of SG president Al Fortier, How-
ard Turner, and Janice Porter
was appointed to discuss the ques-
tion with Strozier. Harrell, and
W. L. Krogman of the Buildings
and Grounds staff.

According to Fortier and Tur-

Born in Melrose. Mass., Wright
did his undergraduate work at
Lombard College in Galesburg,
Illinois, received his MA from the
University of Illinois, and his ScD
from Harvard. Wright holds hon-
orary ScD’s from the University
of Rochester, Yale, and Harvard.

Wright worked with the Depart-
ment of Agriculture as senior ani-
mal husbandman for the Bureau
of Animal Industry from 1915
through 1925, when he joined the
UC faculty. Wright, who received

the money had already been ear-

and could not be spent anywhere

SG then decided to ask the stu-
dents for suggestions on how else
the money could be spent in im-
proving the Commons-C-shop fa-
cilities. A questionnaire signed by
Fortier was drawn up to be circu-
lated in the C-shop. and additional
suggestions were to be left at the
Reynolds club desk.

Cleaning a health measure

Harrell explained that the clean-
ing of Hutchinson Commons was
being undertaken as a health
measure, and pointed out that the
job would include much more
than window washing.

The job is being done by an
outside firm; bids are now being
considered. It will involve clean-
ing of the side-walls, the orna-
mental freeze "work, the medal-
lions, the purlins, the roof tresses
and the sheating. The tradition-

Final registration date announced as Jan. 5;
Two types of late fees cause confusion

by Fred Freed

The final date for registration and the payment of tuition for the coming winter quarter
is January 5, and once more students are faced with the confusion that this date always
seems to bring.

Much of this confusion arises from the fact that there are two types of late fees____________the
late registration fee and the :-----------------------------;-----------------------------___---

Mystery photo identified by
Viennese phy. sci. student

Last week’s mystery photo contest was won by Peter Spug-
ler, a student in the physical science division. From Vienna,
Peter has been in this country since 1951. This is his second

late payment fee, according to

Albert Cotton, bursar.

The late registration fee, a $5
charge by the registrar's office,
will be assessed from each stu-
dents who registers after Janu-
ary 5. It is added on to the tuition
payment right on the registration
card.

The late payment fee, also $5,
is charged by the bursar of those
students who fail to pay their
tuition or to make arrangements
for payment before the January 5
deadline. The Bursar’s office will
be open from 9 to 5 o’clock on
both January 4 and 5.

Now the student might think

that if he both registers and pays
his tuition after the January 5
deadline, he will be charged both
late fees. However, if he pays his
tuiton or makes arrangement to
do so no later than the day follow-
ing his registration, he can avoid
the late payment fee. He will not
escape the late registration fee, of

course.

.Any student who has his tub
tion payment in the mail but
fears that it will arrive after the
January 5 deadline, can go to the
Bursar’s office and ask for a day’s
grace. “We try to be very under-
standing of student problems,’’
said Cotton.

Is man doomed

to new ice age?

The pattern of past variations in the temperature of

the

earth indicates that a new ice age may appear within the next
10,000 years, a UC geologist said Wednesday night at the
meeting in Eckhart hall of the American Meteorological so-
ciety. Cesare Emiliani, research associate in the Institute for
Nuclear Studies, hinted at the possibility of a new glacial age

which may bury cities like
Chicago, Berlin, and Moscow
under a thousand feet of ice.

Emiliani also reported that long
range studies indicate the earth is
pelting colder. The temperature
of the oceans has dropped about
II degrees in the last thirty mil-
lion years.

Method explained

Emiliani’s studies are based
upon a method of measuring the
ratios of two forms of oxygen in
the shells of fossil micro-organ-
isms. This method, developed by
Hie University’s Nobel prize win-
ner Harold C. Urey in 1947, ha's
already shown that the ratio of
these forms of oxygen, oxygen 16
and oxygen 18, varies with the
temperature of the water in which
these tiny creatures once lived.

It has long been known that at
least four successive ice ages with
intervening warmer periods have
swept over the earth’s continents.
The geological record of the con-
tinents is unfortunately fragmen-
tary and incomplete, Emiliani
pointed out.

Sea yields secret

To find out what actually hap-
pened during the last million
years, scientists have turned to an
examination of the climatic rec-
ord of the sea. Samples of deep

cutting cores from the bottom of
the ocean. The cores may be as
much as 60 feet long and reach
back in time more than 2.000.000
years. Studies of the tiny fossil
organisms found in the cores have
shown that the temperature of
the surface of the sea has varied
several degrees Fahrenheit in the
last million years, in separate
periods of about 40.000 years, he
continued.

The coldest points in these pe-
riods corresponded to the glacial
ages. The variation of the tem-
perature may have been due to
variations in the intensity of radi-
ation given off by the sun.

Emiliani explained that the ex-
amination of even older micro-
organisms which lived in the deep
bottom of the central Pacific re-
vealed the general falling off in
temperatures during the last 30,-
000,000 years. The cause for this
long range temperature variation
was probably the progressive re-
treat of the sea from the contin-
ents and the building up of the
earth’s great mountain belts.

Temperature causes cycles

At temperatures beyond a cer-
tain limit, variations in the sun
cycle induced alternations of gla-
cial and interglacial ages, he add-
ed. During the ice ages vast areas
of North America, Europe and
northern Asia have been covered
with hundreds of thousands of
feet of ice. In the warmer inter-
glacial periods, the ice melted
away.

SG drafts State dept

exchange plan letter

A letter to the State department concerning a proposed
visit of Soviet student editors to the United States was drafted
at the Student Government meeting last Tuesday evening. The
latter stated SG’s views on student exchange, and asked that
the State department grant visas to the Soviet editors.

The student assembly also filled three appointive positions.

Kent Marshall was named to
fill the seat on the Southeast
Chicago commission, that is
designated for a UC student. Mar-
shall is a student in the federated
theological schools and is not a
SG member.

Jane Stanford was elected to
the chairmanship of the commis-
sion on the University neighbor-
hood. Miss Stanford. (ISL-Soc.
Sci.l, is a student in the planning
department. James Winkleman, a
fourth year college student, was
named to head the SG educational
survey commission.

Jan Porter (SRP-Col.) intro-
duced the question of the Soviet
editors’ visit. She presented a let-
ter to student assembly express-
ing “the desirability of (obtain-
ing! better communication be-
tween iron curtain countries and
the west.’’ Specific reference was
made to a group of Soviet student
editors who are planning to visit

Notables and students

pay homage to Fermi

Enrico Fermi was hailed as a friend and teacher, as well aS
one of the great scientific figures of the 20th century, at a
memorial service held in his honor last Friday in Rockefeller
chapel.

Crowds attending the service filled the main floor of th^
chapel. During the service, classes in the physics and chem-
istry departments were dis- —:— -------—

missed. Activities in the nu-
clear physics institute came to
almost a complete halt.

The memorial service was at-
tended hy Peiro Guadagnini,
Italian consul - general, and

the visas at that time, suggesting
that the editors apply at a later
date. The department stated that
the visas were denied because US
schools were not in session.

Miss Porter’s draft letter re-
ceived sharp criticism from a
number of ISL members. A new
letter was drafted and introduced
by Pat Parker (ISL-bus.) and
amended by Martin Gouterman
(ISL-Bi.-Sci.). The final letter con-
tained numerous conditions under
which SG would approve of a stu-
dent exchange. These were based
to a large extent on a resolution
passed at the seventh student con-
gress of the National Student as-
sociation.

Conditions which SG felt de-
sirable for international student
exchange as outlined in the let-
ter, include long-term academic
exchanges and a maximum of per-
sonal contacts between students
of the different nations. The let-
ter cautioned against exchanges
which would “be utilized for pur-
poses of partisan political prop-
aganda,’’ but did not specify
whether the proposed visit of So-
viet students fell in this category.

first controlled release of
atomic energy 12 years ago.

Anderson said, “The eternal
scholar, Fermi was always eager
to learn. He was always grateful
when he found out something
new. What he learned, he felt he
should enrich. Having enriched
what he learned, he felt he should
teach- it to others. Thus he pre-
pared the fertile ground out of
which arose the new solutions, the
new ideas which kept the subject
bright, fresh, and exciting.

Speaking of the Institute Alik
son said: “Actually the Insti-
tute is his Institute, for he is its
outstanding source of intellee-
tual stimulation. It was Enrico
who attended every seminar,
and with incredible brilliance,
critically essayed every new
idea or discovery.

"‘Fermi was,” Allison continue^
“one of the intellectuals who
abandoned a comfortable profes-
sorship and great honors in his
own country to join us and be-
come a citizen of the United
States. The only reason for this
was that the limitations placed o<
the range and freedom of activity
of (he mind had become intoler-
able in the countries which they
left.”

Serge reminded those present
at the memorial service that even
before the building of the first
atomic pile. Fermi was one of the
major figures of modern physics.

“The theory of the Raman
effect, of the hyperfine struc-
ture, of the intensity of the
alkali doublets, of J he pressure
shift of spectral lines, of the lat-
itude effect in cosmic rays, the
concept of the virtual quanta
accompanying a moving change,
the statistical atom and many
more hear testimony to tin* uni-
versality of his interest and to
the power of his genius. He In-
itialled many a line of thought
which was to be pursued by a
whole generation, and the mine
is yet not fully exploited.”

Serge remembered that in the
early days Fermi “selected a small
nucleus of his own men by his

NSA exec, committee meets

Student Forum breaks even in

here Dec. 27-31; open to all

The national executive committee of the National Student Association, open to all inter-
ested observers, will meet on the UC campus December 27-31.

The Illinois region is entitled to two seats on the executive committee because it repre-
sents an unusually large number of students. Both seats are occupied by UC students. Illi-
nois region president Bruce Larkin holds one seat and chairs the executive committee, and
Larry Lichtenstein, regional vice-president, occupies the other.

first national debate tourney

Last weekend Student Forum attended the first tournament
of the year that was truly national in scope, at the State Uni-
versity of Iowa. Debating the topic, “Resolved: that the United
States should extend diplomatic recognition to the Communist
government of China,” the team made a record of four vic-
tories and four defeats. ----------------------

The affirmative team, con-' defeated the University of Mis-

Among agenda items are a
number of major policy ques-
tions, mid-year staff reports,
review of regional activity, and
selection of a site for the 1955
NSA congress.

The executive commitee acts
as interim policy body between
annual NSA congresses. It is re-
sponsible for reviewing staff ac-
tions in the light of congress man-
dates, and for assuring that the
mandates are carried out. If im-
portant matters arise on which
there is no mandate the executive
committee is authorized to take
special action for NSA.

NSA is a confederation of ap-
proximately 300 student govern-
ments on campuses throughout
the country. The first meeting of
delegates from the various schools
to plan the association’s beginning
was held in Mandel hall in Decem-
ber, 1946. The University of Chi-
cago has been a member school
Since the organization was begun.

NSA conducts a program of re-
lations with other unions of stu-

dents abroad, and with national
educational organizations in this
country. St^ff members represent
student views on matters of mili-
tary manpower, student tax re-
lief, and government - sponsored
educational exchange programs.

NSA material has been distrib-
uted to all member campus re-
garding UN day and Human
Rights day this autumn. Informa-
tion regarding various activities
of student governments can be
obtained through NSA.

sisting of Michael Stanley and
Joseph Engel, defeated the
University of South Dakota, and
in turn were defeated by Minne-
sota, Iowa, and the University of
Texas.

The negative team consisting of
John Merrill and Roger Bowen

UC Wash Prom
bids priced at $5

Prices of bids for the 1955
Washington Promenade were
fixed at $5 Friday at the first
meeting of the Wash Prom com-
mittee.

An operational plan for trans-
porting UC students from campus
to the north side Hotel Knicker-
bocker, where the dance will be
held, was also formulated.

The organizational meeting was
chaired by Joan Raphael and at-
tended by a central group who
will run the 1955 Wash Prom, to
be held February 19. Remaining
plans for the dance will be an-
nounced after Christmas vacation.

Advise registering this week for
four college preceptorial courses

According to Charles G. Bell, professor of the humanities
in the college, it is advisable to register for college preceptorial
courses this week. A preceptorial, a project involving intensive

souri, Iowa, and the University of
Florida, losing only to the Uni-
versity of Kansas. The outstand-
ing teams in the tournament were
Indiana. 7-1, Kansas, 6-2, and Mar-
quette, 6-2.

This Saturday there will be a
novice tournament at Navy Pier.
A team consisting of Charles
Carlson, Thomas Jersild, Michael
Stanley, and Richard Johnson will
represent UC. The first major
home debate will be held on Janu-
ary 13. Dewane Barnes and Yeheq-
vel Ben-Yeshai will defend the
proposition that "Woman’s place
is in the home,’’ time and location
yet to be announced.

independent work in a variant
of one of the five terminal
courses, may be elected by stu-
dents preparing for social sciences
3, humanities 3, and history com-
prehensives.

The preceptorial topics offered
this year are as follows: History,
some features of cultural history
in relation to the parent course;
Humanities, criticism through
comparison; Social Science, Marx
and Mill or civil liberties.

Preceptorial essays may be sub-
mitted as evidence of eligibility
for honors work. In order to be
accepted for honors work a stu-
dent must have an average of at
least “B” and no grade lower than
a "C.”

The application of the student
must also be approved by a com-
mittee of the department. Appli-
cations for Honors work must be
submitted and approved by the
first week of the winter quarter.

The colorful, unusual, often peculiar character of Oliver
Wendell Holmes was clarified by Francis Biddle, once law
clerk to the famous Supreme Court justice, Mondav night in

Breasted hall.

Often called the “Great Dis-
senter” because of his opinions
issued in dissent to the majority
of the Supreme Court, Holmes did
not believe in the theory of natur-
al law. To him, laws were just
generalties, of which he was very
skeptical.

Instead, explained Biddle,
Holmes applied his idea of life,
“an ever - changing, growing
thing,” to his practice of law, with

judged too harshly for conform-
ing.

The printed portion of the man-
ifesto distributed by the College
of St. Rose, however, is an entire-
ly different matter-and the writer
of the editorial apparently failed
to note this distinction. In declar-
ing opposition to the question on
the grounds quoted, St. Rose is
merely throwing sand, and the
writer seems to have gotten some
of it in his eyes. The question be-
fore the debaters for inquiry is
not “Resolved that the Chinese
people have more freedom under
the People’s Republic of China
than under Chiang Kai Shek’s
regime.” The question up for de-
bate is “Resolved that the United
States should extend diplomatic
recognition to the Communist
government of China.” In rising
to the bait offered by the St. Rose
manifesto, the writer is guilty of
the same cloudy thinking which
gave birth to the statements in the
manifesto. And the emotionalism
which permits either St. Rose or
the writer of the editorial to di-
vert the subject of the debate is,
in my opinion, the most danger-
ous-factor in public opinion today.
It is this emotionalism which
makes it possible for a McCarthy,
a Hitler, or a Lenin to distort facts
and convince an ’ audience of
things that “ain't necessarily so.”

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Carolyn H. Paichel,

tions in that it solicits advertis-
ing on a regular and frequent ba-
sis, adding further to its income.

A glance at any other news-
paper will not, I am sure, reveal
any 60 per cent of the paper’s
space devoted to display adver-
tising, especially if the paper is as
small as eight pages. And any
other newspaper must make ends
meet on the strength of its ad-
vertising rates alone, without any
support from outside.

Certainly the Maroon has a cir-
culation large enough to merit
charging enough per column-inch
of space to be commensurate with
its expenses, which are consider-
ably lessened by the use of a vol-
untary staff which do not draw
pay checks every week.

As a student reads the Maroon,
he wonders whether the staff as

a whole is taking advantage of
the opportunity afforded by col-
lege journalism to learn the news-
paper business, which is the busi-
ness of publishing a readable,
newsy, good newspaper.

John W. Harris

Editor’s note: Total pages pub-
lished by the Maroon has in-
creased by roughly 50 per cent
over the fall quarter 1953. During
the same period, space devoted to
new’s and news feature materials
has approximately doubled, an in-
dication that they are at least
getting their share of the added
space.

The Maroon gets no fixed sub-
sidy and rarely gets more than
10 per cent of its total budget for
the year. Rates are commensu-
rate.

Debate editorial
scored

I should like to comment on
your editorial concerning this
year's national debate topic, which
appeared in the December 3, 1954,
Maroon.

Although the writer of the edi-
torial neglected to state the de-
bate topic under fire (an omis-
sion which was certainly an im-
pediment to the reader’s under-
standing), the topic concerns
the diplomatic recogniton of Com-
munist China by the United
States.

I quite agree with the writer’s
feeling that Mr. Cushing’s ban of
the debate topic is regrettable.
Even more regrettable, certainly,
is the fact that to safeguard the
reputation of his college in the

current climate of opinion, Mr.
Cushing found this action ex-
pedient. Taking this factor, i.e.,
the current trend of public opin-
ion, into consideration, I find it
difficult to condemn Mr. Cush-
ing’s stand as wholeheartedly as
did the writer. An individual judg-
ing the debate could very easily
find that a decision for the affirm-
ative, regardless of how objective-
ly the decisions were made, could
imperil his reputation and. hence,
his job in the eyes of various
vigilant “investigating” commit-
tees. For this reason, I feel that
this year’s debate topic was poor-
ly chosen, in spite of the fact that
it is a legitimately debatable ques-
tion I join with the writer in de-
ploring the situation; but those
whose jobs depend upon conform-
ity should not. in my opinion, be

Too many ads

In the eight-page November 19
issue of the Chicago Maroon, a
measurement with ruled and cal-
culation with pencil showed that
the paper contained 235 column-
inches of news, feature, and edi-
torial copy, 11 column-inches of
classified advertisements, and 371
inches of display advertisements.
Reduced to easier figures, this
means that display advertising
covered more than 150 per cent of
the space occupied on the paper's
pages by news, or 60 per cent of
the total space.

The Maroon is one of the most
heavily-subsized of all student ac-

Shakespearean production analyzed

The importance of relating the Shakespearean play to the Elizabethan playhouse and audi-
ence was emphasized last Friday in a lecture by Robert Speaight, English author, actor and
producer.

Speaight, brought to the UC campus by the committee on social thought and the English

department, attacked those
who maintain that the full
genius of Shakespeare can be ap-
preciated by severing his plays
from their proper historical con-
text.

Through his examination of the
Shakespearean play as presented
on the Elizabethan stage, Speaight
was able to illustrate some of the
shortcomings of modern Shake-
spearean presentations.

To appreciate Shakespeare as it

was originally presented, Speaight
suggested that “we must imagine
what poetry is like to people who
don’t read.” The largely illiterate
Elizabethan audience, however,
was unable then to mentally spell
out words. Consequently, the ly-
ric quality of Shakespeare’s poet-
ry was communicated to early
audiences uncluttered by any sub-
conscious references to written
words.

Speaight suggested as working

(Author of “Barofool Boy With Cheok" tic.) I

THE OPERATOR

On every American campus there are four standard fixtures:
No. 1 — ivy; No. 2 — a statue of the founder; No. 3 — Philip Morris
Cigarettes; No. 4 — The Operator.

The ivy is to prevent strangers from mistaking the college for
a warehouse. The statue of the founder provides shade for necking
when the weather is fine. The Philip Morris Cigarettes are an aid
to concentration when you are'studious, an aid to sociability when
you are sportive, and a source of smoke rings to impress new girls
. . . And The Operator is the man you can’t do without.

Well do I remember The Operator on my campus. He was a young
man with a ready smile, a quick mind, fifteen complete changes of
wardrobe, a six room apartment, a red convertible, and assorted
stocks, bonds, securities, and second mortgages.

The Operator’s origins were a source of lively speculation. Some
said he was left over from the old Capone gang. Some said he was
Judge Crater. Some said he sprang from the brow of Zeus.

But, in fact, he was just an ordinary student — to begin with. In
his first year he studied hard, took copious lecture notes, got good
grades, and made a big reputation as a friend in need. He’d lend
you money; he’d let you copy his lecture notes; he’d write themes
for you; he’d sit up all night to help you cram for an exam. All of
this was done with infinite good nature on his part, and no obligation
on yours . . . The first year, that is.

In the second year The Operator started to operate. He’d still let
you copy his lecture notes — but it cost you a quarter. Sitting up to
help you cram cost 50 cents an hour till midnight, 75 cents an hour
afterwards. His prices for writing themes were based on a sliding
scale —a dollar for a^C”, two for a “B”, three for an “A”. A “D”
cost you nothing, and if you flunked, you got a dollar credit on the
next theme he wrote for you. , ,

His services expanded steadily. He added a line of cribs, for
examinations. He booked bets on football games. He did a bit of
bootlegging. He ran a date bureau. He rented cars, tuxedos, non-wilt-
ing boutonnieres. ,

But all of. these were really sidelines. His main line was lending
money. At any hour of the day or night, for any amount from a dollar
to a hundred, The Operator was always ready with a sympathetic
ear and cash on the barrelhead. And he rarely charged more than
150 percent interest.

Usury*and sharp trading are practices not calculated to win
affection. Nobody loved The Operator. But nobody did anything
about it either . . . Because undergraduates live in a perpetual state
of need — need of money, need of lecture notes, need of romance,
need of beer, need of something —and The Operator was the goose
that laid the golden eggs and, therefore, safe.

Nor did The Operator seek affection. He just went his well-
heeled way, serene and carefree . . . No, not quite carefree. One
thing troubled him: a fear that some day he might graduate. Gradu-
ation, leaving school, would mean the end of his empire. You can’t
run a business like that from the outside; you must be right in the
midst of things, spotting opportunities, anticipating needs, keeping
your finger on the public pulse.

So he took great pains to stay in school, but never to graduate.
This he accomplished by constantly shifting majors. He would come
within a semester of getting a B.A. in sociology and then transfer
to law. When he had nearly enough law credits, he’d switch to
business administration. Then from business administration to
psychology, from psychology to French, from French to history,
and so on, meanwhile getting cultured as all get-out, rich as Croesus,
and never accumulating quite enough credits for a degree.

Finally, of course, it caught up with him. There came a semester
when no matter what he took, he had to wind up with some kind of
a degree. He looked frantically through the class schedule trying to
find some major he hadn’t tried yet. And he found one — physical
education. So, sleek and pudgy though he was from high living, The
Operator entered the department of physical ed.

It was a mistake. Among the people he had to wrestle and box
with were some great hulking fellows who, like everybody else on
campus, owed him money.

Their tiny foreheads creased with glee as they regarded The
Operator’s trembling little body; their massive biceps swelled joy-
ously; their flexors rippled with delight. Rumbling happily, they
fell upon him and covered him with lumps, the smallest of which
would have taken first prize in any lump contest you might name.

Confused and sick at heart, The Operator dragged his battered
members home. He knew he had to get out of physical ed; his life
was forfeit if he did not. So, unhappily, he transferred to some other
course, and the following June, a beaten man in his cap and gown,
received with lifeless hands a diploma and a bachelor of arts degree
and shambled out into the great world.

I don’t know what happened to The Operator after graduation.
It’s not a bad guess that he’s serving time in some pokey somewhere.
Or maybe he was lucky and went into the advertising business. If so,
he is surely a big man on Madison Avenue today.

But, as I say, I don’t know what happened to him. But this I do
know: another Operator appeared on campus as soon as this one
left, and he in turn was replaced by another, and the process goes
on endlessly.

For as long as boy students like girl students better than going
to class, as long as parents cling to the delusion that the allowance
they had at college is sufficient for their children, as long as blood
runs warm and cash runs short, there will be an Operator operating

on every campus everywhere.

rule for modern Shakespearean
actors: “Keep to the meter,empha-
size only the most important
word. The lyric will do the rest.”

The graying actor, who has
taken part in an Elizabethan pro-
duction of Twelfth Night on the
Notre Dame campus, said that
all attempts to simplify the visual
aspects of Shakespearean produc-
tion are useless if the poetic as-
pects are neglected.

A study of the physical attri-
butes of the Elizabethan theaters,
Speaight said, give early presenta-
tions of Shakespeare an effective-
ness often neglected today.

The shifting of the action from
balcony to inner stage to outer
stage provided dramatic changes
of mood which compensated for
the Elizabethan lack of scenery.

The appearance of the porter in
Macbeth, for example, is a scene
of which the humor is lost to mod-
ern viewers of Shakespeare. With
Macduff pounding at the right
door of the Elizabethan stage, the
murdered Duncan lying behind
the right door, and the bloody
Macbeths retired behind the cur-
tain to the inner stage, the bucolic

The Elizabethan stage as re-created from documents. The players
acted upon the elevated outer stage (A), the inner stage (B), and
the back balconies (C). The trap-door (D) was frequently used
for entrance and exit. The only existing contemporary drawing of
the Elizabethan stage shows spectators, not actors in the balcony
above the stage.

face of the porter rising suddenly
from a mid-stage trapdoor (a
once frequently-used device ! must
have provided an unexpected ab-
surd relief from the scene’s dra-
matic tension, a relief which is
lost today.

Since only one contemporary
drawing of the Elizabethan stage
exists, and that one made by a
Dutchman from another Dutch-
man’s description, Speaight said
that many theories of the uses of
scenery and the back balcony over
the stage have sprung up.
Speaight attacked the theory that
the back balcony was used for
distinguished members of the au-
dience and that the stage was
filled with “mansions,” islands of
scenery. Hearing from the over-
head balcony would have been im-
possible. Viewing through the
“mansions” on the elevated stage
would have been impossible from
the main floor of the theater.

Given the sparse stage direc-
tions and the even sparser certain
knowledge of the Elizabethan
theater, it is possible, Speaight
said, to deduce where all the ac-
tions would have taken place and
to determine their effectiveness.

UC’s Scandinavian club cele-
brates Christmas with a Santa
Lucia pageant this' Sunday at 4
p.m. in the Ida Noyes theatre.

Traditionally, Sweden marks
the Yuletide season with a fes-
tival of light. Lucia, the girl
who tradition claims once es-
caped unscathed from a burning

pyre to which she had been
doomed because she had become
a Christian, heralds the ap-
proaching holiday with candle
and songs.

Lucia contests are held in
many Swedish communities and
a beautiful girl is elected to
wear the prized crown.

Christmas season brings
various shopping problems

The Christmas season is the
time for giving gifts. Unfortunate-
ly, Christmas time is also a sea-
son which finds most students’
pocketboods somewhat under-
nourished. However, this does not
necessarily prevent the student
from buying presents for his rela-
tives and friends, because many
stores in the University commu-
nity offer merchandise of high
quality at prices far below those
of the downtown shopping center.

A popular gift for students is
books. Because a student’s read-
ing time is strictly budgeted, this
gift must be one of interest and
quality. Books to fit these quali-
fications may be found at any one
of the myriad of bookstores in the
University neighborhood. Sehnee-
mann’s Red Door on 57th features
an excellent stock of American
and imported books which they
gift-wrap charmingly, while

Carillon rings in yuletide;
bells world’s second largest

Strozier plays Santa

by Fred Karst

The proverbial “loud bells ringing wide and clear” will sound musical overtones to the
UC Christmas season next week as three concerts are played on the Rockefeller chapel
carillon.

The carillonneur, James R. Lawson, will present one concert at 4 p.m. Sunday and another
at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday. He will also play next Friday before and after the Autumn con-
vocation.

Lawson will play the caril-
lon December 19 at 2:30 p.m.
before the Christmas concert
in Bond chapel. Kenneth Gronert,
Lawson’s pupil and carillontur at
the Lutheran Student chapel at
the University of Illinois, will
play Friday, December 24, at
4 p.m. before the Christmas eve

vesper
chapel.

Tape
playing
WFMT

service in Rockefeller

recordings of Lawson’s
will be broadcast over
at 7:30 tonight and at

7:30 p.m., December 20.

The carillon in Rockefeller
chapel, the second largest in the
world, has 72 bells ranging from
lO'i pounds to the Great Bour-
don. weighing 36,926 pounds and
having a diameter of almost ten
feet. The carillon was installed in
1931, three years after the dedi-
cation of the chapel.

In order to make more music
for carillon available, the chapel
is currently undertaking the off-
set reproduction of carillon manu-
scripts. One of these is the "Uni-
versity of Chicago Suite," which
was composed by Kamiel Lefe-
vere, carillonneur of the River-
side church in New York City,

photo by Sygmund

With the carillon which he plays regularly is James K. Lawson,
carilloneur at Rockefeller chapel.

Robert M. Strozier, Dean of Stu-
dents, will be Santa Claus Satur-
day night for forty children, age
5-9, at a Christmas party at the
Phi Gamma Delta house. Another
party, for 13-16 year olds, will be
held by Zeta Beta Tau and Sigma
girls’ club at the fraternity’s chap-
ter house tomorrow afternoon.

The party which stars Dean
Strozier is sponsored by Phi Gam-
ma Delta and two womens’ clubs,
the Mortarboards and the Quad-
ranglers, 80 of whom will be on
hand to greet the kids. Since 1946,
they have held such a party each
year.

Gifts have been provided for
the guests by merchants in the
Hyde Park, Woodlawn, and Ken-
wood areas. The children are
from the UC settlement house.

tion of the chapel, which w as cele-
brated last year.

The carillon is played from con-
trols in a room about 18 stories
up in the tower. The room, about
20 feet square, contains two con-
trol panels.

Each panel has keys that are
struck with the carillonneur’s
clenched hand and pedals that are
struck with his feet. One of the
control panels is used to strike
the bells of the carillon, while
the other, which is used for prac-
tice, makes a sound somewhat like
an xylophone.

The major Christmas services
sponsored by the campus religi-
ous groups include the Methodist
Christmas communion in Bond
chapel Sunday at 3 p.m., spon-
sored by the Methodist student
union; a Christmas party to be
given Thursday by the Calvert
club; Christmas eve vespers in
Rockefeller chapel, December 24
at 4:30 p.m., sponsored by the
chapel staff; and holy communion
sponsored by the Lutheran stu-
dent parish in Thorndike Hilton
chapel, December 25, at 10 a.m.

The Rockefeller vespers service
is planned for students, faculty,
staff and their families. Included
will be the Christmas story from
the Gospel, a worship service read
by the three chapel ministers, and
group carol singing.

Participating in the adoration
at the manger will be faculty chil-
dren, and people will be invited to
bring their gifts for the Univer-

money) up into the chancel for

Creswell's singing not folk' Playwrights presenting
satire on traders rise

It is not absolutely necessary for a folk singer to be “authentic,” but if she isn’t she must
have something else to commend her. This is not the case with Grace Creswell, who present-
ed a concert of “folk songs from the southern Appalachians” in Mandel hall last Friday.

She tried hard to create an “authentic” impression by being announced by a Nashville
businessman with a heavy Southern accent, who announced the numbers with all manner
of balyhoo about how they were sung in her home and family, etc., etc. It was not convinc-

ing. -

Unsophisticated in the
ways of folk music as the
audience Obviously was, it be-
gan to realize this was being
laid on a bit thick.

Unfortunately the accent it-
self was wrong. It was a South-
ern big-city accent, not a Ten-
nessee mountain drawl. The
greater part of the songs were
not authentic, about two-thirds
of them being “old hacks” of
folk music—few of which are
“preserved in the southern Ap-
palachians” in the version in

Campus Sinfonietta gives
annual Christmas concert

The UC Collegiate Sinfonietta is presenting its second an-
nual Christinas concert this Sunday at 4 p.m. in Mandel hall.

The program will feature familiar numbers as well as sev-
eral recently discovered works for chamber orchestra and
soloists.

Among the better known compositions to be heard are

Corelli’s “Concerto Grosso No.
2” and Handel’s “Concerto
Grosso No. 4.” June Blume
will be the soloist in the “Suite for
Flute and Strings” by Telemann,
while Burton Fine will play the
“Violin Concerto No. 2” by Vival-
di. Heard for the first time will
be a sinfonia by Manfredini and

the comparatively unknown bar-
oque masters Beyer and Tunder.
Norma Williams, soprano, will be
the singer.

Admission to concert is free.

which she sang them, and sev-
eral of which are modern “writ-
ten” folk songs. It is highly
probable Miss Creswell got
most of her repertoire off rec-
ords.

Her singing style, too, was any-
thing but “folk.” With a trained
voice generally fitting a dance-
band singer, she tried to imitate
Jo Stafford in her vocal styling.

Now Miss Stafford, also from
Tennessee, sings folk songs quite
tolerably, since she has that
“something else” to replace “folk”
singing style. But Miss Cres-

her mimicry, compounded by her
singing of several Stafford folk

to commend it beside its ex-

Playwrights theatre will put on a new comedy satire, “Rich
But Happy” by Theodore Hoffman, starting Wednesday. The
play concerns the rise of a young man from poverty to riches
through black market trading.

Hoffman’s experience includes directing, journalism, and

lecturing. His first-hand observations of post-war Europe were
a basis for his play.

“Rich But Happy” will run
for two weeks. Reservations

ted only by book and record.

Now Burl Ives revised and sim-
plified his songs, too, and got
away with it since he was a pio-
neer in a period where most peo-
ple were uninitiated to folk music.
Today, near the height of a wave
of folk music enthusiasm, this is
inexcusable.

Prentiss Choate

may be made by phoning WHite-

David Shepherd and the cast in-
cludes Vernon Schwartz, Edward
Asner, Elaine May, Jim Cordes,

Ball. Mae Munro and Jean Arnold.

Camera contest
cancelled due to
lack of entries

The Camera club contest, sched-
uled for December l,was cancelled
because of an insufficient number
of entries.

According to G. M. Mauterer,
president of the group, the reason
for lack of participation was in-
adequate darkroom facilities.

The 40-member Camera club
will sponsor the work of several
photographers in the Art fair this

also planned.

date, the UC Musical society presents its last concert of the fall quar-
ter this Sunday in Ida Noyes library, featuring works by Haydn, Han-
del, Schubert, Respighi, Smith and Mozart.

• Designed to present chamber works in a comparatively informal

and little-heard music.

Sunday’s program begins at 8 p.m.; admission is without charge.

(from page 1)
greeted by applause from the
more than 100 spectators.

On a motion by'Alderman Ken-
neth Campbel), 20th ward, the
committee voted unanimously to
take it under advisement with co-
chairmen Murphy to call a com-
mittee meeting within ten days.

Harvey showed still more pic-
tures and an eleven-minute color
movie showing a quick run-
through of the area. One of the
stills he showed pictured the in-
side of a three-room unfurnished
apartment renting at $51 a month.
“There are a lot of people who
would call that heaven,” he said.
“There isn’t a crack in the ceilings
or walls or on the floors.” He
pointed out that a number of old
frame houses are not scheduled to
be torn down while some good
brick ones are.

Weiner statue
seen at 'Messiah'

Egon Weiner, noted sculptor
who came to Chicago from Vienna
in 1938. has loaned his heroic
statue of Christ, “Ecce Homo.” to
Rockefeller chapel. The statue
was placed in the upper west tran-
sept of the chapel last week in
time to be seen by the two thou-
sand people who came to hear
Handel’s Messiah.

Weiner teaches sculpture at the
Chicago Art institute. This work
was previously exhibited at the
institute and also at the Sheil
school. Weiner has had many one-
man shows of his work in Chi-
cago, New York, Paris and Cali-
fornia. He has won many prizes
for his work in this country and
abroad. He spent last summer do-
ing sculpture for outdoor use in
Sweden and Norway.

Series planned

Religion and politics are the subjects of the two Walgreen Lecture
series scheduleci for the winter quarter.

Robert A. Dahl, associate professor of political science, Yale Uni-
versity, will discuss “Some unsolved problems in the theory of demo-
cratic politics,” in a series of six lectures.

“The Catholic Church in America” will be the subject of John
Tracy Ellis, professor of church history at the Catholic University
of America and Secretary of the American Catholic Historical Asso-
ciation. He will deliver a series of four lectures on the subject.

This lecture series is the second of three Walgreen lectures devoted
to religion in America, the general subject which the Walgreen foun-
dation is considering this year.

All lectures are scheduled for Social Science 122. Dahl will speak
January 10. 12, 14, 17, 19, and 21. Ellis will give his series of lectures
January 24, 25, 27, and 28.

Dirty windows

(from page 1)

Duke of Windsor, in 1924, was
shown the Commons by Ernest
DeWitt Burton, third president of
the University. The Duke com-
mented that the resemblance to
the Magdalen tower at Oxford, of
which the Mitchell tower group is
a prototype, was quite strong
with the exception of the well-
cleaned windows in the Commons.

Directory out at
thirty-five cents

A greater profit is expected from the sales of this year’s
SG published Student Directory, out yesterday, reported Bob
Heavilin, chairman of the student needs committee of Student
Government. The directory sells for its regular price of 35
cents.

CARON

Legend claims this the reason for
their never being washed since.

On returning from his recent
European trip Chancellor Kimp-
ton quoted someone at Oxford as
saying that “We don’t wash win-
dows, but we haven’t thought of
it as a tradition. . . . We just don’t
get around to it.”

Another tale about the windows
tells of the spelling out of the

Heavilin admitted that his ov
the directory through an over-
sight.

While the cost of this year’s
directory remained approximate-
ly the same as last year’s, an ad-
ditional 250 copies have been
printed for sale, due to the in-
crease in UC student enrollment.

word “Chicago on the dusty

name had been omitted from



north wall windows. This was
supposedly done by a group of
inebriated athletes reveling in
their Western conference cham-
pionship in the 1920’s.

An additional $20 worth of ads
over last year’s book and a sav-
ing of that amount again in the
cost of drawing up the ads will
also contribute to the expected
revenue increase. Ads were ac-
cepted only from non-discrimina-

tory merchants and businessmen.

SG may channel the money into
foreign exchange programs.

The 2,000 copies of the direc-
tory were printed by University
Press. A bid from the Reilly com-
pany, printers of the SG Student
Handbook was not granted. Al-
though they would have put the
book out two weeks earlier, the
time saving would have cost an
additional $250.

University college courses
offered now on campus

Basic program courses in the Liberal Education for Adults
program of University college downtown are being offered
for the first time on the University quadrangles.

The scheduling of classes on the UC campus is in response
to the many requests by Hyde Park area residents who wanted
to take classes but were unable to make the frequent trips
to the loop center, according
to Margaret Madden of Uni-
versity college’s downtown

office.

The campus section of the basic
program will meet once a week,
from 6:30 to 9:45 p.m. on Tues-
days.

The program will offer four
years of general .education for
adults, and will provide partici-
pants an opportunity to discuss
the issues of philosophy, science,

politics and poetry in small round-
table classes. A similar program
will be offered at the downtown
branch of University college.

Registration for the winter
quarter 1955 begins December 16
and ends December 30. Classes be-
gin January 3. There are no for-
mal educational requirements for
admission, and 22 is the minimum
age. Further information is avail-
able at University college, 19 S.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Swimmers squeak by Wright JC

winning final, 400 yard relay

Last Friday’s varsity swim meet against Wright Junior college resembled part of a Frank
Merriwell story; only in the final minute did the the UC swimmers come from behind hero-
ically to win by four points, 44-40.

Instead of a one-man triumph, this final event created a quartet of heroes. Don McVick-
ers, Bill Whitney, Mike Mandell and Paul Sellin all helped win the 400 yard relay with a

The winningest team ....

... so far this year poses for their portrait. Only Wheaton beat
them in fen weeks of collegiate running*. And in an extra week of
open meets they won their own Track Club five-mile open, and
placed just behind the New York Athletic Club in the National
A AU 10,000 meter cross country championships in Philadelphia.
Last Sunday they celebrated their season with spaghetti at ex-
runner Ken Brown’s home. They are, left to right, front to back:
Tinkie Keynes, Walt Deike, Paul Baptist, Jim Flynn, Lowel Hawk-
inson; Coach Ted Haydon, Sam Greenlee, Dan Trifone, John Smoth-
ers, Chuck Rhyne, Ted Fishman, Art Omohundro.

combined time of 4:04.

The preceding nine events
had left Chicago behind, 37-40,
and only team depth brought
the Maroons that close. Of twenty-
one swimmers competing for
Coach William Moyle, ten scored
valuable points.

After Wright had opened the
meet by winning the 300-yard
medley relay, Mandell got five
points by winning the 200-yard
swim with 2:36.5. McVickers and
Whitney then got second and third
in the 60-yard swim, Sellin picked
up second in the 120-yard individ-

ual medley, and Frank Chilton
and Bob Herndon placed second
and third in fancy diving to
make the Maroon total 16 points.

Sellin then won the 60-yard free-
style with a time of :58, Bob Geidt
and Mandell got first and second

in the 200 yard backstroke, Geidt
clocking 2:38.4, Lance Felker and
Roland Von Hentig placed second
and third in the 200-yard breast
stroke, and Doug Mauer and Bob
Tres got like places in the 44b
yard swim to set the stage for the
final relay.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

One taken, one blown, by Maroon eagers

Lose to Chicago Teachers

UC’s second basketball game proved to be their first loss
Saturday as Chicago Teachers won their first game, 77-71.

Never out of contention but never in the lead, the Maroon
team remained from one to seven points behind after tying
the score, 28-28, with four minutes to go in the first half.
Good shooting was overbalanced by poor rebounding which

allowed the Teachers to main-
tain their small margin.

The game appeared out of
reach only in the final two min-
utes of play when Teacher’s John
Moscato kept possession of the
ball by some trieky dribbling.

A large crowd, made larger by
nineteen concert band players,
watched Walt Walker/Dick Row-
land. Bill Lester, Fred Hubbard,
and Joe Feinberg play most of the
first half together. Lester, who
was high point man for the eve-
ning with 20 points, sank a lot of

his. jump-shot specialty. The team
play varied through the game.
Part of UC’s rebounding troubles
were caused by the tall Teachers’
forwards, who gave Hubbard and
Rowland considerable difficulty.

Three-man foil

A three-man foil team from this
University won the Fencers
League of America’s champion-
ship in that event for this state
last week. This means that Jay
Levine, Paul Ross, and Mike Fain
are state champs in a national or-
ganization. These three fought
through three rounds of bouts,
eliminating seven competing
teams. In the final round they
clinched the championship, five
bouts to two.

the ball, and slammed the
succeeding jump far out of the
Professionals’ reach. In the
chase for the ball, Joe Chisholm
was fouled, just as the buzzer
sounded. Standing alone — the
game already won for UC — he
sank one of two free shots, giving
the final margin of victory.

Chicago took an early lead and
held it through the first-half, but
the Maroon’s defense fell apart in
the second and third quarters, giv-
ing IPS a nine-point lead at the
point in the second half. UC play-
ers tried a number of long set
shots which missed during this
period.

open house tonight

The Interfraternity council
has decided to sponsor a series
of open houses following week-
end home basketball games.

The open houses will lie in-
formal affairs. There will be
no charge of any sort; every-
one in attendance at the basket-
ball games is welcome.

The open houses will be held
at a different fraternity each
time. The first will be held to-
night at the Phi Kappa Psi
house, 5555 Woodlawn. There
will be records for dancing and
light refreshments will be
served.

Only a hearty group of fans—
including Assistant Dean of Stu-

to observe the game. Neither band

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Sports Briefs

First time in 8 years:
Northwestern swims UC

JV Hoopsters break even; Sports Calenda

win, lose, to Calumet

Coach Joe Stampf’s JV basketball teams split a double-
,	, header against Calumet Tuesday, the frosh-soph winning,

for the first time in eight years and the second time in history today. 3^-20, but then oldei brothers di opped the second game, 27-58.
The only other time that the two schools met in this sport, in Febru-
ary of 1947, the Wildcats won, 62-21, at Evanston. The score will prob-
ably be closer today, since in spite of Northwestern’s ranking fourth

in Big Ten swimming last year, Chicago’s squad has shown great
depth and versatility so far this year.

UC visits UIC for basketball . ..

Next Thursday the UC basketball team will play Illinois Tech in
the first round of the University of Illinois at Chicago’s second annual
basketball tournament. The University of Illinois at Chicago, com-
monly called UIC. is an important name in UC basketball history. It
was against UIC in February of 1953. that Chicago broke its long
losing streak. Last year UIC turned the tables by beating the Ma-
roons twice in an otherwise good season. If they win Thursday, the
UC team will meet the winners of a Lewis-Chicago Teachers game
Friday. The Championship game is Saturday.

... And for Midwest gymnastics

Another Chicago team will be going to UIC for a tournament this
week. Tomorrow the gymnastics team enters the Midwest Open there.
Herb Taylor is entered in all eight of the championship events except
the trampoline. Alumnus Andy Stayart is also competing, since the
team is entered from Acrotheatre, and not the University. Mark
Schuh, Bob Herndon, and Yehuda Baskin, who has returned to UC
from an army stint, are also entered. In the novice events thirteen
younger gymnasts will compete for Aero. Both Taylor and Stayart
are winners of the Daniel L. Hoffer memorial trophy for gymnastics.
Names of the novice men competing for Aero are: Mike Jferrigan,
Craig Saunders. Jerry Jordan, Paul Macapia. Bill Leicht, John Bow-
man. Elichii Fukashima, Mark Schuh. Bob Dauphin, Ernest Finch,
Noble Lee, Wick Coe, and Russell Linford.

Improved play in the second game on behalf of the JVers
was often wasted by poor shooting; John Davey was high
scorer for the team with seven points, even though he played

guard.

High scorer for the game
was Calumet’s forward Jim
Collins, who scored 17 points
through the game and helped his

quarters, outscoring their oppo-
nents, 14-13 in the third period,
but still couldn’t make a serious
threat to Calumet’s quick lead.

his own unorthodox way. I do not
think that he ever spoke of scien-
tific ideals or that he used any
moralizing words, but by the force
of his example inspired in every-
body such a burning devotion to
science that I venture to say for
this group of young men between
the ages of 20 and 25, with a lead-
er of 27 or 28, science was the
greatest passion.”
