SU announces social plans:
C-dance, party, Wash Prom

The annual convention of the Vampires, Witches, Ghouls,
Werewolves, and Warlocks Chowder and Marching Society,
Inc., will be held in conjunction with Student Union’s Danse
Macabre tomorrow night, announced Jan Metros, executive
director of the VWGWWC&M, recently.

Honored guests will include the Three Witches, late of Broadway’s
Macbeth, who will serve their specialty, Virginia ptomaine punch, to
guests with ironclad stomachs.

Welly Shiller’s Murmuring Mandrakes will furnish music for the
earthbound beginning at 9 p.m., and the cock will crow at 12. Admis-
sion in Earth-America cash (please, no bewitched or bemildered
Martian Confederate) $1.75. Surprisingly, guests are to come in ordi-
nary informal dress.

A stellar cast of entertainers will present their own interpretation
of “A Night on Bald Mountain,” or ‘‘On Top of Old Hairless.”

“Here we come a-wassailing” will be the melodic theme of the
annual SU wassail party to be held Wednesday. The wassailers will
celebrate from 4-6 p.m. at Ida Noyes hall.

The party traditionally marks the beginning of the Christmas sea-
son on the UC campus. Highlighted activity of the afternoon will be
the collective decoration of the Ida Noyes Christmas tree, complete
with hot punch and Christmas carols.

Admission to the party is without ticket or charge.

Formal announcement of the plans for the 52nd annual Washing-
ton Promenade was made this week by Dale Levy, president of Stu-
dent Union, the organization sponsoring the dance.

This year’s Wash Prom, traditionally the biggest dance of the UC
social system, will be held in the grand ballroom of the Knickerbocker
hotel on February 19.

Music for the dance will be provided by Phil Levant’s orchestra
featuring vocalist Johnny Desmond, and Lavonne Carroll.

SU’s dance chairman is holding an organizational meeting in the
Reynolds club “fishbowl” today at 3:30. SU has opened the meeting
to any students who are interested in working with the Wash Prom
committee.

SQ to take UC student poll
on Commons cleaning issue

A petition to determine stu-
dent opinion of the administra-
tion’s plan to clean the
Commons has been prepared
by Student Government for circu-
lation in the Commons-C-Shop
area.

According to the letter, signed
by Al Fortier, SG president, the
administration is planning to
clean the walls, woodwork, win-
dows, and ceiling of the Commons,
at a rumored cost of $5,000 to
$8,000. Members of SG have felt
that this money could better be
spent in some other way in the

Commons-C-Shop area, for the im-
provement of these facilities.

The questionnaire asks if the
student feels that the Commons
should be cleaned; if other places,
such as Reynolds Club Lounges,
Swift Commons or Wieboldt
Lounges, could be utilized for C-
Shop type service; and if there
are any other suggestion for im-
proving Commons • C - Shop serv-
ices.

Examples of what the Commons
would look like of the present
plans were carried out are in the
southeast corner of the Commons.

Two associates who spanned both the Italian and American scientific periods of Enrico
Fermi, Nobel prize physicist of the University who died Sunday, will speak at his memorial
service. The service will be held this afternoon at 2 p.m. in Rockefeller chapel.

Herbert Anderson, professor of physics in the Institute for Nuclear Studies, will speak

on Fermi’s scientific achieve-
ments in the United States.
These included the first con-
trolled nuclear chain reaction,
conducted under the stands of
Stagg field, December 2, 1942.

Build cyclotron

Anderson worked with Fermi
during his entire American ca-
reer, which began at Columbia
University, moved to the Univer-
sity of Chicago in 1941, and con-
tinued at Los Alamos, where the
A-bomb was constructed. Ander-
son then collaborated with Fermi
in building the University of Chi-
c a g o ’ s synchrocyclotron, with
which the Italian-born scientist
carried on his post-war studies of
the forces holding together the
nucleus of the atom.

The other speaker is Emilio

Cancel McCarthy'Censure
rally as Senate gives verdict

A scheduled rally supporting censure of Senator McCarthy
was cancelled this week when the Senate took action before
it could be held.

The rally, scheduled for next Tuesday, was sponsored by

Young Democrats, Young Re-
publicans, Students for Demo-
cratic Action, Independent

Ex US attorney
talks on Holmes

Francis Biddle, former US
attorney general, will discuss
the place in constitutional his-
tory of Oliver Wendell Holmes,
justice of the Supreme Court
1902-1932, at 8:30 p.m. Monday in
Breasted hall, Oriental institute.

This is the last of a series of six
free public lectures on justices of
the Supreme Court, sponsored by
the UC law school.

Author of a biography of Jus-
tice Holmes, Biddle was law clerk
to Holmes 1911-1912. He is former
judge of the US third circuit court
of appeals and former solicitor-
general of the United States.

Law students plan
dance conflicting
with next C-Dance

Contrary to the regulations

of

the student code, the Law Stu-
dents association will hold a dance
at the same time as the all-campus
Student Union dance this Satur-
day. SU president Dale Levy
called the double scheduling a
“misunderstanding” and said that
Vincent Diana, president of the
law group had apologized.

Miss Levy emphasized that Stu-
dent Union will not bring charges,
and has fully accepted the apol-
ogy. However, she hopes that or-
ganizations will note that no social
event may be held at the same
time as a social event of an all-
University nature, according to
the student code. All socail events
must be registered with the stu-
dent activities office.

Segre, now a professor of physics
at the University of California,
W'ho holds the first PhD awarded
under Fermi when the latter be-
came professor of theoretical
physics at Rome. He collaborated
in the early studies for which
Fermi won the Nobel prize, and
later worked with Fermi in the
United States at Los Alamos.

Presiding at the services will
be Samuel K. Anderson, profes-
sor of physics and director of the
Institute for Nuclear Studies, in
which Fermi held the Charles H.

Fermi, UC scientist, dies at 53

Cancer claims Nobel prize winning physicist
who achieved first nuclear chain reaction

by Ronald Grossman

Enrico Fermi, an architect of the atomic bomb, whose basic discoveries in physics opened
the atomic age, died early Sunday at his home at 5327 University. Funeral services were
held on Monday for the man who led a team of scientists at the University of Chicago to
achieve the world’s first sustained nuclear reaction.

Fermi, 53, had undergone what was described as an “exploratory” operation in Billings
hospital on October 9, which revealed an advanced stage of cancer. He returned to his home
several weeks ago, and spent
most of his time answering
letters.

Fermi, a Charles H. Swift dis-
tinguished service professor of
physics, had been with the Uni-
versity since 1945 when he joined
the Institute of Nuclear Studies
in the research institute.

Award from AEC

Only two weeks ago, he was
awarded a $25,000 prize from the

Enrico Fermi

Father of the atomic bomb' rises
to world fame from humble start

by Ronald Grossman

More than any other man of his time, Enrico Fermi could properly be named “the father of the atomic bomb.”

The son of a railroad official, he was born in Rome, Italy, on September 29, 1901. He studied at the University of Pisa
from 1918 to 1922, and later at the Universities of Leyden and Gottingden. In 1924 he was appointed lecturer at the Uni-

versity of Florence.

It was his epoch-making exp
fission, the basic principle unde

In that year, he began to
bombard atomic nuclei with
neutrons.

With extremely simple equip-
ment, Fermi began systemati-
cally bombarding the elements
in the periodic table, beginning
with the lightest element and
moving up to the heavier ele-
ments. In the process, Fermi
and his associates analyzed the
chemical end products of the
neutron bombardment.

When at last they came to
uranium, then the heaviest
known element, they found that
more than one element was pro-
duced by the bombardment, and
that at least one of the radioac-
tive products seemed to be none
of the existing elements close
to uranium. Actually they had
not produced a new element,
but, as later analysis showed,#
that had split uranium atoms.

Dr. Fermi also gained fame
while still in Rome for another
major discovery, essential for the
production of atomic energy. This
was the all-important observation
that neutrons can be slowed down
from speeds of more than 10,000
miles per second to speeds of only
one mile per second by making
them pass through light elements,
and that such slowed-down neu-
trons become more than a hun-
dred times more accurate in hit-
ting their targets in the nuclei of
atoms, and thus creating new ele-
ments, than fast neutrons.

These led to Fermi’s receiv-
ing the Nobel Prize in physics

Atomic Energy commission for
his work on the atomic bomb. The
award, the first such to be author-
ized under the terms of the new
atomic energy act enacted this
year, was bestowed upon Fermi
with the approval of President
Eisenhower.

The award cited Fermi for his
“especially meritorious contri-
butions’’ in atomic energy. The
citation also noted Fermi’s con-
tributions to basic neutron
physics and the achievement of
the controlled nuclear chain re-
action. Rear Admiral Lewis L.
Strauss, chairman of the com-
mission, commented in an an-
nouncement at the tune that
Fermi’s work had been of “tre-
mendous importance’’ in the de-
velopment of atomic energy.

“As much as any individual, he
is responsible for the achievement
of the controlled release of nu-
clear energy,’’ Strauss said.

The Fermi award was also an-
nounced on the floor of the United
States Senate on the day it was
given.

Not due to radiation

Announcement of the AEC
award reportedly was advanced
because the critical nature of Dr.
Fermi’s illness was common
knowledge among scientists.

An atomic research associate
of Fermi said that the fatal can-
cer was not caused by Fermi’s
experiments with controlled nu-
clear energy. They did not sub-
ject him unduly to radioactive

eriments at the University of
rlying the atomic bomb as we

in 1938.

Fermi, unhappy in Mussoli-
ni’s Italy, especially from the
time when the Italian dictator
began promulgating anti-Sem-
itic laws to please Hitler, took
the opportunity to escape from
the Fascist-ridden land when he
received his award in the au-
tumn of 1938.

Leaving Italy with his wife and
two children to go to Stockholm,
he informed the Italian authori-
ties he had accepted a temporary
teaching post in an American uni-
versity. He arrived in New York
on January 2, 1939, and quietly
assumed a permanent post on the
physics faculty at Columbia Uni-
versity.

Opens epoch

He could not have come at a
more opportune time. In Ger-
many, unknown to him, a team of
Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann,
who had been repeating the pio-
neer experiment begun by Fermi
in Rome in 1934, had stumbled
upon the world-shaking discovery
that the shooting of neutrons at
uranium resulted in the splitting
of the uranium atom, or uranium
fission. *

Bohr arrived in New York on
January 16, 1939, and at once com-
municated the news to physicists
in Princeton. Soon it reached Dr.
Fermi in Columbia, who passed it
on to other colleagues. On the
night of January 25, 1939, in the
basement of Pupin Hall on the
Columbia campus, the first split-

substances, he added, and any
such injury from radiation
would have affected the eyes
first.

Physicians suggested an explor-
atory operation when Fermi re-
turned ill from a visit to Italy in
September. The operation re-
vealed cancer so generalized that
any treatment would have been
ineffective.

Many express regrets

Dr. Fermi's untimely death was
felt in many ways on the UC cam-
pus.

Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimp-
ton, on a trip to the east with
Dean Robert M. Strozier, altered
his plans so that he could return
to Chicago for the memorial serv-
ice which will be held today at
2 p.m.

Expressions of grief came from
many well-known figures at UC.
Samuel K. Allison, director of the
Institute for Nuclear Studies,
spoke for the scientists at the Uni-
versity of Chicago.

“There is no doubt among
those who knew him well that
Enrico Fermi was one of the
most brilliant intellects of our
century,” Allison said.

“His associates at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, where he was
the intellectual leader of the
physics group, know that his
loss can never be adequately
replaced.”

Harold Urey, Martin A. Ryer-
son distinguished service profes-
sor of chemistry, a long time

’ome in 1934 that led directly
as the atomic power plant.

ting of the uranium atom in
America took place. It was not
long before the epoch-making ex-
periment was carried further at
the University of Chicago, where
the first nuclear chain reaction
took place under Fermi’s direc-
tion.

As early as March, 1939, less
than three months after his arriv-
ing in U. S., Fermi, armed with
a letter of introduction from Co-
lumbia to Admiral S. C. Hooper,
in Washington, tried to interest
the Navy Department in the pos-
sibility of an atomic bomb.

Start Manhattan district

Unsuccessful in negotiating for
support at first, Fermi and other
scientists persisted. Realizing the
danger that confronted the free
world because of the swift work
which the Nazis were doing in
Germany, they induced the most
famous scientist - exile among
them, Albert Einstein, to write
the historic letter to President
Roosevelt, which led to the even-
tual development of the $2,000,-
000,000 Manhattan Engineering
District, as the atomic bomb proj-
ect was known.

Dr. Fermi, in association with
Leo Szilard, another exile, then
began working at Columbia on
the construction of the first exper-
imental “piles.” By the time the
government was ready to support
the project with substantial funds,
the Fermi-Szilard team had laid
down the groundwork that made
the first chain reaction “pile” pos-

Enrico Fermi in front of a control panel which he used in his work.

friend and associate of Dr. Fermi,
also expressed his/deepest senti-
ments at the loss of the great
scientist.

threat creative feat

Fermi died just a few days
short of the twelfth anniversary
of the world’s first atomic fire,
which he supervised on the
squash court under the west
stands of Stagg field on December
2. 1942. Chancellor Kimpton, who
served for a time as UC admin-
istration officer of atomic energy
work being conducted on campus,
called the achievement “one of the
greatest feats of creative effort
man has ever achieved.”

Fermi also served as a consult-
ant in the design of the Univer-
sity’s synchrocyclotron, one of the
world's most powerful atom
smashers.

to the discovery of uranium

sible.

It was twelve years ago this
week, on December 2, 1942, that
Fermi and the team of scientists
he led lighted the first atomic fire
on earth, on a gloomy squash
court under the west stands of
Stagg field.

Creates atom pile

Enrico Fermi was the chief
architect of that atomic furnace,
which he named "pile,” but which
has since become better known as
a nuclear reactor, the technical
name for an atomic power plant.

After Fermi had set the atomic
furnace into successful operation
in 1942, Dr. Arthur Holly Comp-
ton, now of Washington Univer-
sity, St. Louis, and director of the
Metallurgical Laboratory, tele-
phoned an impromptu coded mes-
sage to Dr. James B. Conant, then
president of Harvard University
and also head of the National De-
fense Research committee.

Dr. Compton said: “The Italian
navigator arrived at the shores of
the new world.” Dr. Conant then
asked, “How were the natives?”
Dr. Compton replied, “Very
friendly.” Thus was word received
by Washington that the first
atomic fire in history had been
kindled.

Fermi’s first “pile,” activated
at the University of Chicago, was
the forerunner of all the atomic
power plants now being built and
planned for the generation of
atomic power for industrial and
other peacetime uses.

He was a member of the Amer-
ican Philosophical society, the
American Physical society and
Sigma Xi. honorary scientific fra-
ternity. In 1938, he received the
Nobel prize in physics for his
studies.

Dr. Fermi’s wife. Mrs. Laura
Capon Fermi, is well known for
her recently published book,
Atoms in the Family, describing
her life with the famous scientist.
The couple had two children,
Nelia and Giulio. Giulio, 18, at-
tended the UC college from 1951
to 1953. He is now studying math-
ematics at Oberlin College.

Fermi’s death came on the very
day that the Maroon congratulat-
ed him in an editors' column for
his Atomic Energy commission
award for meritorious work in
atomic energy.

Joins UC staff

At the war’s end when the Uni-
versity of Chicago decided to keep
together the nucleus of-the scien-
tists who had worked in the Met-
allurgical laboratory on the cam-
pus on the development of the
bomb, Fermi joined the staff of
the newly founded Institute for
Nuclear Studies in the then new
Research Institute at 57th and
Ellis. In the Institute, Fermi
continued his investigations of
the atom’s fundamental proper-
ties, concentrating on the nature
of particles constituting the nu-
cleus, or heart of the atom. As an
aid in this investigation, Fermi
served as a consultant in the de-
sign of the UC’s synchrocyclotron,
until recently the most powerful
atom smasher in the world.

Nuffield college, Oxford Univer- plish more than it has but are vinced that “disapproval, loud and
.site in a lecture at Social Science often unwilling to adopt means public, and in suitable terms
would be an effective political fac-
tor leading to the disappearance
of the regime at -which it was
aimed.” Beloff stated that our re-
cent attitude toward. China, like
our attitude toward the USSR in
the thirties, has reflected this
peculiarly democratic conviction.

Beloff, an historian with a par-
ticular interest in American and
Soviet histories, discussed “The
democratic control of foreign pol-
icy," under the auspices of the UC
center for the study of American
foreign policy.

Paradoxically opposed to Amer-
ican over-confidence, Beloff added,
it is a tendency for Americans to
readily blame treason and sheer
stupidity for foreign policy fail-
ure.

There also exists a “tendency
to over-value common sense,” ac-
cording to Beloff. “Common
sense,” however, fails to provide
the knowledge crucial to foreign
policy, knowledge about the for-
eigner. One of the most important
questions in our foreign policy, he
continued, is how far the foreign
policy expert will be allowed to
voice his opinions and what insti-
tutions will give his opinion
effectiveness.

Congressional hearings are a
way of sounding public opinion
which are not available in other
democracies, he added.

The visiting historian stated
that his current trip to the US has
convinced him that the US is' a
“profoundly pacifistic country.”
The contrary impression which
our policies create abroad Beloff
attributed to our democratic pecu-
liarities. In a democracy tem-
porary public frustration can
easily be manifested in foreign
policies and create misimpres-
sions. On the other hand, he added,
policies of the USSR sound less
aggressive because Soviet foreign
policies are not directly responsi-
ble to the public and do not, con-
sequently, vent frustrations of the
Soviet people.

Editors' Column

Mourn death of Fermi

It was only last week that Enrico Fermi’s name appeared in this
column. At that time we had had occasion to comment on a new honor
conferred upon Dr. Fermi. Now Enrico Fermi is dead. In fact, he was
a dying man when the Atomic Energy Commission conferred upon
him the singular honor of its first special award for contributions
in the field of nuclear physics.

It was impossible to ignore Enrico Fermi, the internationally
famous nuclear scientist; he had wrought one of the modern wonders
of the world. He was more than a Nobel-prize winner; Time magazine
had called him the greatest living atomic scientist. He was enor-
mously productive at 53 in a science where most great contributions
are made by men in their late twenties. A scientist once said that
it was impossible to discuss nuclear physics for five minutes without
talking about Enrico Fermi.

But those who knew the man as the dedicated scientist he was are
sure that his greatest satisfaction came from the work itself, rather
than from the world wide recognition it brought him. The explanation
of this is simple: Fermi was a humble man. His humility manifested
itself in his modesty, his dealings with friends and associates, and in
his attitude towards his students. People came to know and respect
the man because of this feature of his personality.

It is true that Fermi’s achievements will be a source of inspiration
to the generation of physicists who come after him. May the humility
of this man, whose intellect demonstrated the highest powers to be
achieved from the mind which the Creator bestowed upon man, also
be an inspiration and set a keynote for our lives.

Dr. Fermi’s death is a tremendous loss to the University of Chicago,
to the nation, and to the world. To his bereaved family, may we extend
our deepest condolences.

Editorial

Maroon frowns on debate nix

Of all the people in the world one of the last
you'd ever expect to rocket to national prominence
would be Herbert L. Cushing, President of the
Kearney State Teachers’ College, Kearney, Ne-
braska. Yet he managed to do so on October 26th
when he told the United Press that he had forbid-
den the college debating team to compete on the
subject of recognizing Communist China.

"I personally feel,’’ Cushing said, “that back of
it all is a bit of a desire on the part of somebody
to indoctrinate a few thousand American college
youths with what I consider to be a dangerous
philosophy.”

The statement did not occasion the usual stam-
pede of not-meism, but enough other colleges fol-
lowed suit to warm the cockles of Mr. Cushing's
freedom-loving heart. He was joined by the other
Nebraska teachers’ colleges, the University of
Omaha, a solid third of the country's Catholic col-
leges, and most shocking of all, West Point and
Annapolis. Most of the reputable universities, how-
ever. held the line, and strong statement by both
UC's director of student activities, William Biren-
baum. and Northwestern's debate director, Glen
Mills, were on the UP wire the same day. It is
worth noting that neither the University of Ne-
braska nor Notre Dame, along with most large
Catholic universities, have followed the lead of
their small but vocal colleges.

A sample of the minority Catholic attitude,
which must not be taken as the opinion of the
hierarchy which has already given the topic full
clearance, was received by the Student Forum
office on October 29th. The letter, in the form of
a manifesto, was sent to the nation’s universities
by the College of St. Rose, Albany, New York.
Among the numerous whereases we find the fol-

lowing:

“WHEREAS the so-called People’s Republic of
China has established itself as a ruthless dictator-
ship, and suppressed the religious and political
freedom of the Chinese people,

“NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that
we formally declare our opposition to the National
Debate Topic . . .”

Apparently anyone who might wish to know
just what freedom the Chinese people ever had
to lose or to inquire just what Chiang Kai-Shek s
dictatorship ever demonstrated in the way of
truth, had better not ask his questions at St. Rose.
It was this ostrich-like attitude that lost the friend-
ship of China in the first place, and is now on the
verge of losing Asia Itself.

But even the possible loss of Asia is overshad-
owed by the possible loss of freedom of expres-
sion in America, for what would it avail to win
such prizes for a country whose national char-
acter is in the process of melting away? The only
“dangerous philosophy” easily detectable in the
current controversy is the attitude of Cushing
himself.

It is most gratifying to note that the President
feels the issue serious enough to risk a comment.
In response to a question as to whether or not the
decision to prevent the West Point and Annapolis
teams from debating the question “coincides with
your views on intellectual freedom?” the President
said he would trust their judgment if they wanted
to argue about Red China and would allow them
to state their case as strongly as they wished. The
regrettable aspect of the affair is that such a
statement was necessary. Our forefathers held
these (ruths to be self evident.

Maroon staffer casts fishy eye
on SQ stamp appropriations

Editor's note: The incident commented on in the ac-
companying .statement is true. The author wants it
understood that he is completely serious and wrote the
article with a straight face. The staff wants it under-
stood that these are not necessarily their views and
otherwise wash their hands of the whole business.

It was brought to the uneasy attention of Student Government
echelons at a recent SG meeting that rhe appropriations they had
granted for 500 postage stamps in a short-term interval was sus-
piciously large. When asked to account for the use of stamps, offi-
cials of the majority party (which shall remain nameless) could only
murmur something to ihe effect that "Well, uh. we do, uh a LOT of
mailing.”

The Maroon is too honest, a publication to accuse ISL fwhich shall
remain nameless) of feathering their nesrs with purple replicas of
G. Washington, but we would like to publicly ask ISL (which shall
remain nameless) members to answer the following questions:

IS IT TRUE THAT CLIVE’ GRAY CORRESPONDS DAILY WITH

A PEN PAL IN CAPETOWN, SOUTH AFRICA?

IS IT TRUE THAT ELI STEIN MAILED IN 219 POST CARD VOTES
TO THE MORRIS B. SACHS AMATEUR HOUR?

Sidelight on music

Your music critic, Robert Bloch,
has a deft pen, and he used it to
great advantage in his discussion
of the Schneider-Balsam concert
in last Saturday's Maroon. Ho also
revealed that he has read widely
in the literature of music critic-
ism. However, he has either read
too rapidly, or he is withholding
some interesting information. The
"Victorian music critic named di
Bassetto” was, in fact, none other
than Bernard Shaw.

Shaw wrote under the name
"Como di Bassetto” during ihe
late ’80s and the early ’90s for
at least one small London paper
(the Star) and perhaps for others.
His two columns a week in the
Star, for which he received about
a guinea, comprised his first
steady employment. The name,
Corno di Bassetto, means Basset
Horn. The Basset Horn is a rarely
used variety of tenor clarinet,
which has a particularly toneless
tone. Shaw says, in his introduc-
tion to the first volume of his
collected music criticism, that if
he had know what the Basset
Horn sounded like when he chose
the name, he would have chosen
another.	Sincerely,

Robert I Wolfson

Drives to renovate UC environs

Approximately 22.000 Illinois
veterans in training under public
law 550 were warned by the Vet-
eran's administration regional of-
fice last week that their allow-
ance checks may be delayed if
they fail to submit their monthly
certifications before December 10.

Under the law, a veteran must

fill out a monthly report of train-
ing signed by both the veteran
and a responsible official of his
school. It is the responsibility of
the veteran and the school to
make sure that the report is
signed, correctly completed, and
sent to the VA regional office,
2030 West Taylor, Chicago 12. VA
cannot send out checks until they
receive the report.

The campaign to improve the neighborhood around the University of Chicago took one
step forward and another step backward this week.

On the positive side, James C. Downs, Jr., the city’s housing and redevelopment coordina-
tor, submitted to Mayor Kennelly and the city council an ordinance authorizing Chicago to
apply for federal funds to be used in planning its first urban renewal project.

What have VICEROYS got
that other
filter tip cigarettes
• haven’t got?

Inside every Viceroy tip is a vast network
of 20,000 individual filters to filter your
smoke over and over again. You get only
the full, rich taste of Viceroy’s choice to-
baccos . . . and Viceroys draw so freely.

Yes, you get Viceroy’s remarkable new
tip . . . with 20,000 individual filters . . .
plus king-size length for only a penny or
two more than cigarettes without filters.

THE ANSWER IS

20,000 FILTERS

IN EVERY VICEROY TIP

This project would improve
Grove, Lake Michigan and the
I north boundary of the UC
campus.

The step backward came when
the city council delayed approval
of the Hyde Park redevelopment
program. The Hyde Park plan had
been recommended by the coun-
cil’s housing and planning com-
mittee. headed by Alderman Rob-
ert E. Merriam.

‘Too few hearings’

At the council’s Monday meet-
ing Aiderman William H. Harvey
complained that Merriam’s com-
mittee had not held enough pub-
lic hearings on the Hyde Park
project.

Harvey showed his fellow aider-
men pictures of some of the build-
ings which would be torn down.
He insisted that the buildings are
in good condition, and said.
“These people's homes are at
stake.”

Merriam replied that only four
per cent of the homes to be torn
down are owned by their tenants.
The council voted 30 to 8 to send
the program back to the housing
committee for further study and
for more public hearings.

The housing committee will
hold another session on the pro-
posal next Wednesday.

The Chicago Sun - Tinies dis-
closed yesterday that only one of
the homes mentioned by Aider-
man Harvey is to be torn down as
part of the Hyde Park project. Ac-
cording to the newspaper, a sur-
vey showed that “eleven of the
twelve houses used as exhibits by
Harvey are not in the redevelop-
ment area.” The one house actu-
ally in the area is located at 1322
East 54th.

the appearance of the area

Delays action

The council delayed action on
the second proposal, backed by
Mayor Kennelly and by Merriam’s
housing committee, that the city
seek federal funds to build 3800
public low-rent housing units.

The low-rent housing would be
used to relocate people whose
homes had been torn down to
make way for the city’s redevelop-
ment and public improvement
projects. The city council will
take up the question again on De-
cember 9.

Before a municipality can ob-
tain federal aid. the Federal Hous-
ing and Home Finance agency
must certify that the municipality
has a “workable program” for
housing, slum clearance or urban
renewal work.

A new club, the Archaeology
club, formed on campus recently.
First meeting is scheduled for to-
day at 8 p.m., at Ida Noyes; all
those interested are invited to at-
tend.

Officers are president, William
Hallo, a student of assyriology;
vice president, Nick Millet, col-
lege; and secretary. Penny Wea-
dock, Mesopotamian archaeology.
The club's faculty adviser is Rob-
ert Adams of the department of
anthropology and the Oriental
institute.

by 47th street, Cottage

vember 12 to Albert M. Cole, ad-
ministrator of the Housing and
Home Finance agency, along with
documents showing in detail that
the city meets the requirements
of the housing act of 1954.

On November 19 the city coun-
cil’s housing committee approved
a resolution certifying the need
for the 3800 low-rent housing
units. Only 35,000 such units can
be built under the provisions of
the 1954 act.

The Hyde Park projects de-
ferred by the council Monday in-
volve 47 blighted acres between
Kimbark and Lake Park avenues,
53rd and 57th streets. About 700
homes, a shopping center and
parking facilities would be con-
structed on two sites proposed by
the South East Chicago commis-
sion (SECO.

Explains plan

J. Ross Humphreys, chairman
of the Chicago land clearance
commission, testified before the
council’s housing committee on
November 23 pointing out that
the plans are interim proposals
showing what the commission be-
lieves should be done in the area.

Illinois law requires the land
clearance group to submit to the
city council the plans of the re-
developers before the land is sold.
Humphreys said the plans were
an excellent technical job but not
final.

Julian H. Levi, executive direc-
tor oLthe SECC, told the commit-
tee that the projects are endorsed
by 33 community organizations
representing 9500 families in
Hyde Park and Kenwood.

Discriminatory file reflects UC area

by Palmer Pinney

Any University of Chicago student seeking an apartment this week might have come
across a card in the University’s housing file carrying the following address and information;
6040 Ingleside, 2 rooms, 1 bathroom, 2 single beds, $32.50 per month, available from Oct. 1.

Any Chicago student desiring this particular apartment might have left the housing bu-
reau’s files on the Administration building’s first floor, walked west to Ingleside and south to
just short of 61st Street, and read a sign in the window of 6040: 2 Room Apt., Furnished,

stove and refrig., also Sleep-
ing Room (White).

And any Negro student
reading this sign would have
1 tu ned back toward campus, per-
haps to try another address from
the University’s file.

Problems arising from the list-
ing of discriminatory landlords in
the housing file are neither recent
nor rare. In fact, a little over four
years ago, the housing bureau
maintained two files, one gener-
ally available only to white stu-
dents, the other generally avail-
able only to Negroes. This system
saved some embarrassment to Ne-
gro students, but it also created
embarrassment for landlords who
were asked whether or not they
would accept Negro students, and
resulted in a Negro file that listed
housing generally more extensive
and further distant than that
given in the white file.

In February of 1950 three stu-
dents met twice with Dean Rob-
ert E. Strozier protesting this sys-
tem. As a result of the meetings
Doan Strozier, in the words of
one of the participating students,
“ . . . announced that beginning
with the summer quarter the sep-
arate filing system would be abol-
ished. He did not feel that the
University could at this time re-
fuse to list rooms of landlords
who are known to follow a dis-
criminatory policy but said that
no such notations would be made
on the cards. He said, further,
that a letter would be sent to all
landlords informing them of this
new policy. ... It is hoped that,
in this way, landlords will be less
prone to discriminate in their
renting policy.”

No change since 1950

“At this time” has extended
up to the present, and landlords
seem as prone to discriminate
now as they did four years ago.

In the summer of 1953, for in-
stance, two Negro students sought
an apartment near the University.
According to one of them, now
living in Burton-Judson courts,
“Upon finding a vacancy listed
in the University housing files,
we attempted to secure an apart-
ment at Midway Drexel Apts.
(6020 Drexel). The landlord in-

formed us that no vacancies ex-
isted. Subsequent to’our visit, sev-
eral white friends secured apart-
ments. An obvious case of dis-
crimination.”

Speaking of the Midway Plais-
ance Apts., the same student said,
“The landlord’s son told us that
vacancies existed. We were to
come back the next day and make
final arrangements for renting.
The landlord told us that day that
it was a mistake by his son.”

Problems and incidents like
these, arising from the listing of
discriminatory landlords in the
housing file, hurt the individuals
involved very much in themselves.
But in order to be understood they
must be set in a background,
and seen as part of a total situa-
tion. In Hyde Park, as in other
city communities, the key to this
total situation is the influx of
Negroes into previously all- or
nearly all-white areas.

Population Changes

In the decade between 1930-40,
total Negro population in Hyde
Park—between 51st and 60th, and
from Cottage Grove to Lake Mich-
igan—rose only ten per cent. In
the decade 1940-50 it rose 206 per
cent. Total Negro distribution in
that decade increased to 3.2 per
cent, having remained at a con-
stant 1.1 per cent during the pre-
ceding ten years. These dry per-
centages evoked some warm re-
sponses from, organizations in
Hyde Park.

Before 1948 these responses
took the form of race restrictive
covenants: written promises by
property owners not to sell or
rent property in some cases to
any “non-Caucasian” and in other
cases, to any person “of Negro,
Mongolian, or Jewish ancestry.”
One of these responses was stated
by the author of a Master’s thesis
submitted in 1951 on The Neigh-
borhood Improvement Associa-
tion: A Counter-Force to the Ex-
pansion of Chicago’s Negro Popu-
lation: “The western section of
Hyde Park and neighboring
Woodlawn is dominated by the
University of Chicago commu-
nity. The possibility that this in-
stitution might be surrounded by
a Negro community has long been

of concern. As a member of the
Woodlawn Property Owners’
league, the business agent for the
school was active in promoting
restrictive covenants throughout
the area.”

Supreme Court rules

In May of 1948 the United
States Supreme Court declared
that covenants which restrict the
purchase and occupancy of land
on a racial or religious basis can
no longer be enforced by the
courts.

Since then one of the chief re-
sponses to Negro influx has been

the occupancy standards agree-
ment; an agreement imposing lim-
itations on the use of property
such as limiting the number of
persons per room, preventing con-

nance standards for all buildings.

One of these responses is given
in the Local Community Fact
Book for Chicago. 1950: “Before
the Negroes moved in, Hyde Park
versions which create crowding, had experienced an increase in
and agreeing to certain mainte- conversions; this was accelerated
with the coming of this new

make its first appearance, resplendent with new uniforms,
Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Field house to give support to the
Maroon basketball team in their game with Chicago Teachers

college.

Last year, under the president-
ship of Roland Finston, the band
played at five basketball games
and performed for the Acrothea-
tre 'Show in Mandel hall.

The history of the band has
been both long and colorful. In

with reversible innerspring

complete

versity and solo cornet in the
group, organized the band. The
organization made its first pub-
lic appearance on December 16,
1898, and was an immediate suc-
cess. Remunerations offered to
students giving time to the group
helped in the growth as well as
the popularity of the group.

In 1922, C. D. Greenleaf, prom-
inent alto player in the band, gave
the University 100 instruments,
among them “Big Bertha,” the
largest bass drum in the world.
The giant was more than eight
feet in diameter and required a
special express car for its trans-
portation when it traveled with
the band and football team.

When the drum had been com-
pleted in the Conn factor in Elk-
hart it was too large to be re-
moved from the building; conse-
quently, a portion of the factory
wall was removed. Throughout
the years, the drum proved a
troublesome mascot, but one of
which the team was, nevertheless,
proud. Bertha now resides in the
museum in Indiana.

UC had a real concert band for
the first time in 1928. Peter Clark
was conducting, and under his
direction the football parade band
was regrouped into a straight
concert band. The band’s best year
was 1930, not only on the local
level, where it was the most pop-
ular activity on campus, but in
competition with all “Big Ten”
schools, Chicago’s band ranked
first from every angle.

One of the main reasons for
the band’s popularity was its
breaking of tradition. It was no
longer a military band, but a top-
notch parade and concert band
which introduced the “stutter
step” and the “crash halt” as part
of its marvelous stunt formations.
Not only did band members also
sing, but now they even began
four part vocal harmony.

The current band, meeting ev-
ery Tuesday night at Sunny gym,
5823 Kenwood, at 8 p.m., is build-
ing on its present membership of
25 players.

group. The formation of the
, Southeast Chicago commission
represents an effort on the part
of the community to stay the tide
of conversions and to maintain
Hyde Park as a middle class resi-
dential area for all racial groups.
Leadership in the commission is
provided by the University of Chi-
cago.”

UC sets policy

And again from the thesis: “In
Woodlawn, a number of new
apartment buildings have been
erected both by the University of
Chicago and by private builders.
In addition, the University has
bought a number of old building
and remodeled them. They are at-
tempting to raise the property
values of the community by new
building and to make the neigh-
borhood more attractive to people
in a higher income bracket.”

University policy is apparently
aimed at maintaining Hyde Park
and the northern portion of Wood-
lawn — Woodlawn lies between
South Park Avenue and Lake
Michigan, and 60th and 67th
streets—as an interracial middle
class residential area. However,
judging from the experience of
three law school students, this
area can be said to be interracial
only in a limited sense.

Students look for home

These three students, one of
them Negro, started searching for
an apartment together on Septem-
ber 18 of this year. At first they
went to real estate agents. All
three of them, well dressed and
over 21, went through approxi-
mately the same routine each
time they entered a real estate of-
fice. They spoke to a secretary,
telling her they were willing to
take anything from 4^ to seven
rooms anywhere from Maryland
to Harper and from 47th to 59th
streets. The secretary gave them
a list of places. They were asked
to fill out an application, and told
that the renting agent had to
speak to the owner, and so they
should wait until phoned.

After this, they attempted phon-
ing, using numbers given in news-
paper classified sections. They
called about 60 places in this way,
were told to see various superin-
tendents, and after deciding, in
most cases, to rent, were either
given the application routine or
told that students aren’t a good
risk or that the owner was away
on vacation.

All attempts unsuccessful

Next they tried agents who
dealt in Negro real estate, but
these agents were willing to rent
only at prohibitive prices. In all
these attempts they had refer-
ences from law school officials
and prominent men both in the
city and elsewhere.

On September 26 they were
rented a place by the landlord’s
wife, who evidently didn’t detect
the skin color of one of them,
for later the landlord told them
that he wanted to serve notice
on them. On October 1 they aban-
doned the struggle and split up,
having tried real estate agents,
newspaper ads, and several hous-
ing file addresses. Only one of
the places they tried said an out-
right, “We don’t take Negroes.*

Playwrights Shakuntala creative;
fantasy varied, flavor refreshing

A colorful Indian fantasy is now in performance at Playwrights. In their production of
Shakuntala by Kalidasa (written between the first and third centuries), the directors have
incorporated material from Kalidasa’s sources, the Mahabarhata and the Ramayana, re-
sulting in a rich creative presentation.

The attractive feature of Shakuntala is its wholehearted spirit of abandon, its refreshing
spirit of “diversified and un^onfined play.” One happily notes Kalidasa’s ignorance of stage
conventions and the absence of

the usual “unities.” This is not
to say that Shakuntala is one
big bundle of confused frolic, for
the central theme is of a serious,
touching folk nature. Yet all arti-
fice is dropped and the simple,
varied sentiments of the partici-
pants are allowed free reign.

in bare outline the plot con-
cerns a youthful, good-natured
king with an intense desire for
a son, the king’s selfish high
priest, and a humble yet per-
ceptive, prophetic hermit. The
priest, while praying intensely
for a son for the king, gets side-
tracked by a beautiful nymph
who promises him a son, and
the result is his daughter, Sha-

kuntala, whom
who is adopted

Shakuntala is
young girl, and
dentally meets

he curses and
by the hermit.

a gentle sweet
when she acci-
the king some

years later in her guardian's her-
mitage, the two fall in love. The
king vanishes and Shakuntala sits
quietly in her garden, convinced
that they shall one day be re-
united; and thus they are —
through the adoration of the
king's chief sculptor (who uses
her as his model for an inspired
sculpture which delights the king,
and causes him to send for the
model'; and through the inno-
cence and adventurousness of

their son.

Through all the diverse facets
of the play: Shakuntala’s soft
firm determination to regain
her forgetful lover, and the boy-
ishness and boisterousness of
their son; the hilarious comic
interlude with the clever, sharp-
tongued mendicant and his deal-
ings with a gullible merchant
and the merchant’s amusingly
sluttish wife; through the ado
ration for Shakuntala of the
chief sculptor who is also the
frenzied museum guide, who
hundreds of years later is en-
tranced by the sculpture;
through all this runs the stream
of a vivid, colorful fantasy,
varied in scope, legendary in
character, free in spirit.

Unfortunately, the cast seems
to feel somewhat uneasy in some
of the roles. Perhaps the unusual
form of the play is the disrupting
factor, but be that as it may, few
of the cast are able to thrust
themselves into the mood of the
work. The impression was almost
as if each actor had acted in a
different key.

In particular, Edward Asner
has a tendency to lean toward
the grandiose in his roles; as
the hermit, his accent nail'd dic-
tion and eloquent tone are out
of place. Rolf Forsberg as the

king is unspectacular though
competent, and Vernon
Schwartz as Durvasas the high-
priest portrays well the latter’s
vicious, morbid nature.

Shakuntala is sensitive!}' played
by Sarah Mineo and Ranne Sioux’
characterization of her son ^ re-
plete with boyish gusto. To this
reviewer, the most pleasant as-
pect of the production was An-
tony Holland’s clear, pointed Mad-
havya, the mendicant. His very
pronounced and somewhat arti-
ficial diction fitted very well into
the part of a clever roguish hyp-
ocrite.

The Manipuri dancing of
Nina Guha is absorbing; par-
ticularly so, was her exquisite
use of her hands. In fact,
throughout the performance
this device — manipulation of
the hands (mostly on the part
of the women)—did much to en-
hance the expression.

The latest point of interest is
the simple setting, which consist-
ed of four or five large screens at
angles to each other and proved
appropriate for the many tab-
leaux. Yet in certain significant,
intense scenes a more vivid, imag-
inative background would have
been preferable. Joel Picliery

Italian film depicts miners’ trip Twelve year old stars

struggle through alps for work

The Path of Hope, an Italian film with English subtitles, is opening in Chicago today at the
Cinema Annex, 3210 Madison. The film deals with a group of Sicilian sulphur miners who,
unable to support themselves, leave with their families in order to find work in France.

To afford the illegal entry which they must make, the Italian villagers take a long and
difficult trip through northern Italy, and over the Alps. Many give up hope before France

is reached.

Raf Vallone plays a widow-
<.r with three children who
manages to save the beautiful
Elena Varzi from a bandit during
the course of the journey.

When It seems that the limit of
endurance is reached they arrive
at the frontier. There they are
surprised by French and Italian
guards on skis. "Where are you
coming from?” asks the French
guard. "From Sicily,” is the an-
swer. In amazement and pity the
Frenchman looks at the men, the
women, and the children, who

have traveled across a whole coun-
try for a chance at life in a new
land.

Exhaustion, desperation, en-
treaty are written on their faces.
Their hopes, their lives are in his
hands; without a word, with a
gesture of understanding he
glides away. The other guards
follow. The journey is over. Hope
lies beyond.

Many critics have railed this

film, the Italian Salt of the
Earth. It was directed by Pietro
Germi, and was filmed in Italy,
Sicily, anti the Alps. The project
involved such feats as photog-
raphy six thousand feet high in
the snowy Alps, and the playing
of scenes 1200 feet down in a
sulphur mine. Crowd scenes arid
bit parts were taken from life.
The movie took five months to
complete.

Last Sunday the UC Track Club cross country team turned in a great team performance
to upset long-established Eastern team standings in the National AAU 10,000-meter US cross
country championship which was sponsored by the Penn athletic club on a rugged 6.4-mile
course in Fairmont park, Philadelphia. The UCTC entered a full eight-man team composed

ACCORDING TO THE LARGEST and latest coast-to-coast
college survey, college smokers prefer Luckies—and
by a wide margin. The No. 1 reason: Luckies taste
better. Thousands of students appreciate Luckies’
better taste almost as much as the pair in the Droodle
above, titled: Sweethearts attempting to kiss and
enjoy better-tasting Luckies at same time. Luckies
taste better for good reasons. First of all, Lucky
Strike means fine tobacco. Then, “It's Toasted” to
taste better. This famous Lucky Strike process tones
up Luckies’ light, good-tasting tobacco to make it
taste even better—cleaner, fresher, smoother. So,

enjoy the better-tasting cigarette

Professor Finer flails fighters;

Is told sportmanship is corny

Evidently operating on the principle that political science stu-
dents and faculty don’t read the sports pages of Daily News, Profes-
sor Herman Finer dashed off a few caustic comments on a recent
, hampionship fight.

Former welterweight Finer—who still enjoys the pugilistic game
over television—complained about the phony alibis and bad sports-
manship of one of the fighters. “Aren’t we all tired to death of clinch-
es and rabbit-punches, and men who instead of appreciating the
superiority of the other man, try to find alibis? What kind of lesson
is this to our youth?”

Daily News sportswriter Jack Mabley replied (in part): “Dear
Herman, don’t bring youth into it. If our youths are going to get their
moral inspiration from what they see in the boxing ring and on tele-
vision, we’re due for some rough years ... Sportsmanship? Don’t be
corny.”

U C wins basketball start

Maroon basketball fans, that select few, went home smiling through their tears Wednes-
day night after the varsity opened their 1954-55 season by trouncing the Fifth Army head-
quarters team 71 to 49. Although the score was high the caliber of play was low, and it was
only the ineptness of the opposition which prevented a different outcome.

A typical early season game, it was rough and very ragged, and the roughhouse was not
curbed by the erratic foul calling of the referees. At some times the most blatant fouls were

Justin Johnson runs again

Justin Johnson, who used to run—and win—the high hurdles and
the broad jump for the UC track team, ran—and lost—a 220-yard
dash for the US Air Force recently. He picked up second in the race.
Johnson, who used to be reached at BJ, now needs this information
on his letters: A/C Justin M. Johnson, AD 13518996; Group 6, Squad-

ignored while at others body
contact alone was enough to
provoke a penalty. Even a
technical foul, on Al Binford for
bouncing the ball too hard after
a penalty call, failed to halt the
mayhem.

High scorer for the Maroons
was Bill Lester, the only letter
winning guard returning from
last season. Although the smallest
man on the floor throughout
much of the game, Bill was out-
standing on defense as well as
contributing 25 points to the var-
sity total.

Coach Norgren started a vet-
eran squad including four mem-
bers of last year’s team. They
started very slowly, but were
never behind due to Army’s lack
of scoring punch and their own
fair defensive rebounding which
rarely allowed the Army more
than three shots at the basket,
which was not enough for them.
Fred Hubbard, who played center
through most of the game, was
his usual smooth self, sometimes
amazing his teammates as much
as the opposition by his unexpect-
ed passes. Walter Walker, a
freshman last year, showed im-
provement while putting up a
solid game both on offense and
defense.

The brightest spot in the pic-
ture was the newcomers’ perform-
ance. Joe Feinberg filled out the
starting team and played good
aggressive ball, particularly on
defense before fouling out in the
last quarter. Dick Rowland also
contributed actively with 10
points, while Mitch Watkins, an
outstanding player on the junior
varsity last year, showed real

promise in this first varsity game.

Despite attempts by the Women’s Athletic association's
varsity volleyball team, Wheaton college maintained a slim
second-half margin to win 27-25 Tuesday in Ida Noyes. This,

the final game of the season,

two wins and seven defeats.

Earlier in the week the varsity
team lost to Navy Pier by 33-20.

THE CHICAGO MaROON

December 3, 1954

Social Sciences praised
in report published today

U. C. debaters
at U. of Iowa

Old 'bohemian' stronghold
lacks funds, closes down

A Report on the Behavioral Sciences, a self-study prepared
at UC and sponsored and financed by the Ford foundation,
was released by the University of Chicago press today.

The report praised the “research-oriented” faculty, divi-
sional organization, caliber of the students, facilities, and
public relations program; but criticized the shifting of Uni-
versity funds from general ' “

funds to specific “projects.”

Recommendations of the re-
port include changes in organiza-
tion of behavioral sciences, the
establishment of fellowships and
scholarships, and allotment of
funds for informing the public of
work.

“The committee is impressed
with the genuine strength of the
University in the area of the be-
havioral sciences, which it match-
ed only by interest in its further
development,” said Sol Tax. pro-
fessor of anthropology and chair-
man of the committee in charge
of the study. “We find this inter-
est in every division in the Uni-
versify, in the professional
schools, and in the college. The
method of attack varies greatly,
but recognition of the importance
of understanding human behavior
is at every hand.”

Five schools participate

The division of behavioral sci-
ences of the Ford foundation in-
vited 15 universities to submit
proposals for study of their own

havioral sciences comes from
“creative specialized researches
. . . in an atmosphere which wel-
comes diversity and encourages
critical discussion,” and profes-
sional schools play an important
role in this research.

Standards may be endangered

But the report warns that the
University’s freedom and high
standards are “endangered by a
shift ... of financial support from
general University funds to re-
stricted “project” funds and that
the University tends too much to-
ward making its new enterprises
into permanent commitments.

Members of the committee that
prepared the report are Tax; Ben-
jamin S. Bloom, UC examiner and
professor of education; Everett
C. Hughes, chairman of the so-
ciology department; Howard F.
Hunt, associate professor of psy-
chology; Edward H. Levi, dean of
the law’ school; and Robert Red-
field. Robert M. Hutchins distin-
guished service professor of an-
thropology.

Roger Bowen, and John Merrill
left yesterday for the University
of Iowa, where they will partici-
pate in a debate tournament to-
day and tomorrow on the ques-
tion “Resolved: that the United
States should extend diplomatic
recognition to the Communist
government of China.”

A Chicago team consisting of
Richard Johnson, Engel, Holly
O’Connor, and Paul Weiss com-
piled a record of five victories and
three defeats on the same topic at
the Bradley invitational tourna-
ment November 19 and 20.

The affirmative team of Engel
and Johnson won all four of their
debates, meriting the highest
award of the tournament, a “su-
perior” certificate, an honor shar-
ed with only twelve of the 142
affirmative debaters competing.

Laborite to talk
on British policy

Dr. David Ginsburg, director of
the research department of the
British Labor party, will speak at
4:30 this afternoon in Social Sci-
ence 107.

He will answer questions con-
cerning British politics, including
foreign and domestic policy and
intra-party problems.

Whitman Co-op house, once famous stronghold of “bohemi-
anism” on the UC campus and one of the last remaining co-
educational student co-ops in the country, finally folded last
month.

Financial straits and a lack of members finally forced the
collapse of the house, which has been taking tremendous losses

Carnegie Corp,
grants a million
for education

Exploring important new devel-
opments on the educational scene
is one basic goal of grants
amounting to $1,281,000 announc-
ed this week by the Carnegie cor-
poration.

Among the grants is one of
$200,000, which will be divided
equally among Chicago, Colum-
bia, Harvard, aud Yale, to con-
tinue for two more years a pro-
gram of “internships” in general
education.

Under this plan, started three
years ago with corporation sup-
port, faculty members from
smaller colleges participate in the
“imaginative general education
programs” at the four universi-
ties. "Their experience enables
smaller colleges to benefit from
the pioneering work of the larger
schools.”

for the last three years. The
house has now been vacated

and the furniture sold, and the

building itself is up for sale.

In fall 1951 the administration
prohibited the students from liv-
ing in Whitman because of al-
leged insufficient separation of
the sexes. (Women lived on the
second floor of the house and men
on the third.) Prior to this ban
50 per cent or more of Whitman-
ites had been students.

The same year the house sus-
tained a total loss of approximate-
ly $5,000. The tailspin continued
into last year, and then things
leveled off. But this fall the house
suddenly found itself with practi-
cally no residents. It took several
hundred dollars loss for two
months and then called it quits.

activities in the behavioral sci-
ences. Of the 14 universities that
did so, the foundation chose the
proposals of Harvard. Stanford,
North Carolina, Michigan, and
Chicago, and gave each $50,000
with which to conduct its study.

In accordance with the founda-
tion’s specifications for the gen-
eral form of the study, Chancel-
lor Lawrence A. Kimpton in the
summer of 1953 appointed a com-
mittee of six faculty members to
complete the study.

The committee found that “the
University has the initial advan-
tage of a faculty predominantly
oriented toward research” and
that the “grouping of departments
into divisions has encouraged a
tremendous interchange of ideas.”

In one of these, it is reported, six

University housing file seem to

twenty million dollars and in
which leadership, by virtue of the
Southeast Chicago commission,
“is provided by the University of
