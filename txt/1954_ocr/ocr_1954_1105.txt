Appoint Harris dean
of social sciences

in place of Grodzins

Chauncey D. Harris has been appointed acting dean of the
division of the social sciences. Morton Grodzins, who became

US must change foreign policy
Randall commission head urges

By Jean Kwon

“Whether. . . we are prepared to reshape our foreign economic policy in a manner that
will both advance the welfare of the free world and serve our own interest is presently the
neat unanswered question,” declared Clarence B. Randall in the first of three Charles R.

Walgreen foundation lectures presented last week.
Randall is former chairman

of the United States commis-
sion on foreign economic pol-
icy (established 1953). He is
chairman of the board of the In-
land Steel company and has been
a UC trustee since 1936. He has
also served as chief of a special
United States mission to Turkey
in 1953, and as steel consultant
for the Economic Cooperation ad-
ministration in 1948.

Monday’s lecture, on “The ur-
gency of our dilemma,” was the
first in the series.

Stand on own feet

The end of "the vast outpour-
ing of our assets to aid the world”
is at hand. Randall declared. "The
world must soon stand on its own
feet. It must come off the Amer-
ican dole, as it wants to do. and
earn its own way. as it is deter-
mined to do.”

Clarence Randell

He asserted that the greatest
strides toward recovery have been
taken by nations which come clos-
est to our economic formula of
life.

Outlines economic policy

Therefore, Randall believes, the
foreign economic policy of the
United States should be devoted
to the furtherance of three prin-
ciples: reliance upon private ef-
fort and intelligence called forth
by proper incentives, the govern-
ing control of vigorous competi-
tion, and the registering of

Project plans aid
for prexy selections

A trustees’ project, to help trustees and regents of public
and private institutions select presidents, has been set up in
Judd hall.

The project will advise governing boards on selecting their
chief administrative officers
and will maintain a carefully
screened file of persons who
can be recommended for par-

ticular institutions. It will utilize
a network of consultants in uni-
versities and colleges throughout
the country as sources of informa-
tion about promising candidates.

"Trustes are more and more
recognizing that the presidency
of an institution of higher educa-
tion is one of the most demanding
positions in American life,” stated
Manning M. Pattiilo, director of
the project.

"The burden of fund-raising in
private institutions increases

yearly, ahd the public relations

choices through the free market.

There is an urgent need for a
basic and consistent foreign eco-
nomic policy aimed toward a se-
cure nation with a steadily rising
standard of living, according to
Randall. “To achieve a sound pol-
icy requires first a basic philos-
ophy that finds continuous ex-
pression in the laws passed by
Congress and in the actions of the
executive branch of government.
No such consistency of philosophy
has prevailed in recent years.”

Later lectures on page 5.

problem of the tax-supported uni-
versity becomes more complex all
the time. In a very real sense the
positon of president is an almost
impossible one in that only a few
men are equipped to carry this re-
sponsibiity successfully.”

Pattiilo emphasized that the
trustees’ project will serve trust-
ees of institutions throughout the
country, and is not connected with
the board of trustees of this uni-
versity.

He also said that “the establish-
ment of the project here further
enhances the position of the Uni-
versity as a center of scholarly
activity and consultant service in

the field of higher education.”

dean early this year, has left that position to become adviser
to the Chancellor on special projects.

Harris stated that he will
continue to carry out the proj-
ects which Grodzins began.
There will be no major policy
changes in the division, he an-
nounced.

Harris, who studied at Brigham
Young University, the London
School of Economics, and Oxford,
received his PhD at UC and, in
1943, joined the faculty. He is a
geographer, specializing in the
economic geography of Europe
and the Soviet Union.

The committee, elected Novem-
ber 1 to confer with the Chancel-
lor on selection of a permanent
dean, is the same one which se-
lected Dean Grodzins. The com-
mittee members are Cyril O.
Houle, William T. Hutchinson.
James G. Miller, Robert Redfield.
Carl R. Rogers, Theodore W.
Schultz, and Leonard D. White,
chairman.

Names of probable candidates Chauncy Harris
are not known.

Two SC seats,
chairmanships
still need filling

Applications are now being
accepted from interested per-
sons to fill two vacancies in
Student Government, one in
the college and one in the medical
school, and for the positions of
chairman of the commission on
the University neighborhood and
EG representative to the South-
east Chicago commission.

Applicants for the SG positions
-must have at least a “C” average
for all University courses they
have taken, and must expect to be
in residence for more than one
quarter. Those interested should
leave name, address, and phone
number in the SG box at the
Reynolds club desk.

New Cap and Gown
'conservative again'

Get day off

One more day of vacation
has been added to the Univer-
sity calendar since its original
publication last summer. Tues-
day, Jan. 4, will be a holiday
this year, extending the winter
interim by one day.

Residence halls will be open
Monday, Jan. 3, rather than
Sunday, Jan. 2, as was an-
nounced earlier.

Since the publication of the
catalogues and other official
publications, it has been decid-
ed to make the Monday follow-
ing a Saturday or Sunday holi-
day, a holiday also, registrar
William E. Scott announced
last week.

Social scientists issue voting analysis:
handshakes, rallies, hullabaloo in vain

Note to exhausted candidates: Much of the tag end campaign hullabaloo was probably in
vain. The experts have just announced that last minute speeches, handshaking, and rallies
left 79 per cent of the voters untouched. They had made up their minds long since.

Three social scientists have just published a book analyzing how voters make up their
minds. It bears the title of
“Voting,” and is published by
the University of Chicago
Press — too late this time to

do the harried office seekers any
good. Authors are Bernard R.
Berelson, formerly of the faculty
of the University of Chicago and
now Director of the Behavioral
Science of the Ford Foundation,
and Paul R. Lazarsfeld and Wil-

Toynbee coming

Arnold Toynbee, author of
A Study of History, will speak
on “World unity and history”
at 2 p.m., November 24 in
Mandel hall.

Toynbee, whose last volumes
of his ten-volume study of his-
tory were published last month,
is being brought to UC by the
Committee on social thought.

Toynbee is a research profes-
sor of international, history at
the University of London and
director of studies in the Brit-
ish Royal Institute on Interna-
tional Affairs.

liam N. McPhee of Columbia Uni-
versity.’

Their conclusions are based on
a study made over a period of sev-
eral months in Elmira, New York,
during the 1948 presidential cam-
paign. They checked over a thou-
sand voters, not once but several
times, to follow the voting de-
cisions the individuals were mak-
ing-

Among the things they found
out were

Sixty-four per cent of the voters
had made up their minds as early
as June.

Another 15 per cent decided in
August how they were going to
vote and stuck with their deci-
sions.

Only 10 per cent made their
choice in November.

Most voters, the three experts
say. mark the ballot because of
factors apart from speeches and
propaganda. The citizen’ vote is
a product of his social and eco-
nomic status, personal relation-
ships, business connections, and
the way be has voted in the past.

Husbands and wives follow each

other’s political lead. In fact, all
members of the family unit tend
to vote alike. Within families
there is 90 per cent agreement on
candidates and issues.

Strangely enough, less than
one-half of the voters agreed with
their parties on political issues of
greatest importance. And only
one-third of the voters had a high-
ly accurate idea of where the can-
didates they supported stood on
issues.

In Elmira, local party organ-
izations were not particularly ef-
fective. There were no sound
trucks, no parades, no street cor-
ner meetings to , reach voters.
Television, newspapers and radio
made the greatest impact on the
voters. The voters also made clos-
er contact with the national lead-
ers of either party through such
media.

In spite of the impact of the
speech-making, however, the au-
thor’s conclude that the voter who
seeks for information, and looks
at both sides before making up
his mind, is a creature so rare he
might be said not to exist.

. Cap and Gown staff recently announced their plans for the
1955 edition of UC’s yearbook.

“The general tone of the yearbook will once again be fairly
conservative,” said Mike Rogers, editor. He explained that
since one of the major criti-
cisms of last year’s book was
that it lacked unity, this year’s

plan would be built around a

definite theme.

With Bill Seckinger as business
manager, Mary Joan Spiegel and
Paul Hoffman as associate editors
and Remington Stone as layout
manager, Rogers expressed hope
that actual work on the format
would commence soon. To date no

work on this year’s annual,

the contract to publish this year’s

of bids have been received in the
last few weeks.

The publication date is tenta-
tively set for June 1. This year’s
Cap and Gown has set as its
goals a more complete coverage
of campus activities, a larger and
more comprehensive section on
campus religious activties, and a
wide selection of “University
mood shots.”

Rainstorm leads winner to ferns

A rainstorm provided Dorothy Eppler, second year college
student with the correct answer to last week’s Maroon mys-
tery photo.

Miss Eppler was first confronted with the potted ferns when
she retreated into Rosenwald
Hall from a rainstorm two
weeks ago. In her words, Miss
Eppler described the event:

“Stopping off in Rosenwald for
shelter from a typical Chicago
(rain), I decided to look at the
specimens incarcerated there.
Halfway through the mica schists,
I turned a corner and found my-
self facing a pair of potted ferns
which were positively crawling
with some species of minute,
winged gnats.

“1 took a good look before pro-
ceeding on. a procedure for which
I had good reason to be thankful.”

Johannesen gives
UC concert tonight

Grant Johannesen, young Amer-
ican pianist, will present a Uni-
versity of Chicago concert at 8:30
p.m., Friday, Nov. 5, in Leon
Mandel hall, 5714 University Ave-
nue.

Johannesen’s program includes
Mozart, Variations on a Minuet
by Du port, K. 573; Beethoven,
Sonata in F sharp. Opus 78; Schu-
mann. Humoreske, Opus 20;
Faure, Theme et Variations, Opus
73, and four pieces by Ravel.

Johannesen, born in Salt Lake
City, Utah, made his New York
debut in 1944. He won first prize
at the International Piano Festi-
val in Belgium in 1949, and has
toured widely in this country,
Europe, and South America.

Other University of Chicago
concerts during the Autumn
Quarter will be a Sonata Recital
November 19 by Alexander
Schneider, violin, and Arthur Bal-
sam, piano, and a ballad program
by Grace Creswell, contralto, on
December 3.

Single admission tickets are
$1.50.

Miss Eppler said that she had
the correct answer at 8 a.m. be-
fore either the Maroon office or
Reynolds club opened. She turned
in her answer at the Reynolds
club desk.

For her correct answer, Miss
Eppler received a carton of king-
size Philip Morris cigarettes do-
nated by the Philip Morris com-
pany.

l-F plans ball
for holiday

The annual Inter-Fraternity
ball, sponsored by the Inter-
Fraternity council, will be held
at the Shoreland hotel on No-
vember 24, the day before
Thanksgiving.

High point of the formal
dance will be the crowning of
a queen, who will be chosen
from the nominees of all the
fraternities. Because the affair
is being held nearer to the cam-
pus than in previous years, at-
tendance is expected to reach
350 people, Johnny Smothers
of the I-F council predicted. A
ticket admitting one couple will
cost $5.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Randall criticizes
tariffsz 'give awaysr

(first lecture of the Randall series on page 1)

The United States’ historically-based protectionist trade
policy is out of date, asserted Clarence B. Randall Tuesday in
“Trade must move toward liberalization,” the second of three
lectures on “Our foreign economic policy.”

High tariff barriers damage American international rela-
tionships both in economic and political fields. The United
States needs friends in the

world, both for security and
for the future support ef its
expanding industrial effort.

“That clearly can be accom-
plished only by a gradual turning
toward the liberalization of trade,
and the freer flow of goods of
others into our own markets,” he
said.

‘Grants abnormal’

Terming foreign economic
grants in aid made by the United
States “abnormal,” Randall said
the chief drawback of the Mar-
shall plan was its failure to add
to “the free resources available
for general investment in the re-
cipient countries.”

His commission on economic
foreign policy has recommended
to Eisenhower a policy of gradual
and selective reduction of trade
harriers. The program would lib-
eralize tariffs over a period of
three years, on the basis of multi-1
lateral negotiations with other
nations.

“It would be difficult to con-
ceive a more moderate or gradual
approach than this to the develop-
ment of economic policy suited
for the modern world,” he said.

Wednesday’s lecture was de-
voted to “Some of the roadblocks
to trade liberalization.”

Safely disposing of America’s
farm surpluses abroad is merely
one of several crucial problems
confronting the United States in
the field of international trade,
Randall warned.

Giving away large quantities
of agricultural surpluses may sap
the economic strength of some of
the very nations we have been try-
ing to help. For example, if the
United States gives wheat to po-
tential customers for Turkey’s

wheat surplus, which has been
made possible by US technical
assistance, the entire program of
self help has been nullified.

‘Trade hampered’

The “buy American” legal re-
strictions on government pur-
chases also hamper trade and
place a heavy burden on the tax-
payer of which he is only dimly
aware. It is actually “a concealed
subsidy to American business,
which for the most part goes to
companies that are strong and
prosperous.”

While criticizing the reliance of
foreign businessmen on cartels,
price agreements, allocation of
markets, and production quotas,
Randall also stated that Amer-
ican business has not been with-
out fault. “We require our for-
eign supporters to take the losses
(when prices fall) but do not per-
mit them to recoup” when de-
mand greatly exceeds supply and
prices rise.

Red trade unwise

He also expressed the conclu-
sion that trade with Red China at
this time would be unwise, but
urged that at the same time the
whole topic be kept under perma-
nent review.

Randall cited three main ob-
stacles to a realistic policy on
world trade. One is the lack of
understanding of the problem by
the American public. The second
is a complex administrative diffi-
culty, within the executive branch
of the government. The third and
greatest is the inability of Amer-
ican business to place the national
welfare above self-interest.

The lecture series will be pub-
lished in book form November 15
by the UC press under the title,
A Foreign Economic Policy for
the United States.

Fall rush ends;
pledge period
begins in clubs

Fall Rushing for the four
women’s clubs on campus has
ended, and 47 girls, 75 per cent
of the number who were bid,
have begun formal pledging. This
is a 300 per cent increase over the
number of girls who pledged clubs
last year.

Two weeks of open rushing will
begin next Tuesday. Any eligible
women on campus who are inter-
ested in rushing and have not yet
done so may leave their names
with Mrs. Newman in the student
activities office.

“These girls will be invited to
meet club members and may be
bid by the clubs at the end of the
two Wk A period.” stated Ruth
Ko pel, president of Interclub
council.

Lorenz to lecture
on concepts of
animal behavior

Developer of the concept of
“imprinting” in animal psy-
chology, Dr. Konrad Z. Lorenz,
will discuss “Concepts of Ethol-
ogy” Nov. 11 at 4:30 p.m. in Judd
126.

Lorenz is currently conducting
his research in ethology, the
studs' of instinctive animal be-
havior, as director of the Max
Planck institute for study of com-
parative behavior in Buldern, Ger-
ma ny.

Lorenz’s experiments with the
phenomena of “imprinting” have
revealed that new-born animals
attach a mother-identification
with the first moving animal ob-
ject they sense; in his experi-
ments Lorenz was once identified
as a mother-object and pursued by
a group of new-born goslings.

Lorenz has also pioneered in
using behavior patterns for classi-
fication of animals as biologists
use morphological differences.

Physicists aid archeology;
isotope dates calender

The “atomic calendar” has established the solution to the
mystery of the correlation of the ancient Mayan and the
modern calendar. Willard F. Libby, professor of chemistry in
the University of Chicago’s institute for nuclear studies, cur-
rently on leave to serve as a member of the Atomic Energy
commission, described the correlation in an article appearing
in Science magazine today.

The article includes findings
made by Libby in establishing

In establishing the definitive

frames had identical Mayan dates
carved on them. Libby turned a

Havighurst: love, punishment, consistency,
most important factors in child development
by Bob Quinn

SRP rejects partisanship

The Student Representative party caucus Sunday evening
pledged itself to co-operative work with any campus group
whose aims were similar to theirs, rejecting a suggested plan

Originator of the developmental task theory and author of several books on child develop-
ment, Dr. Robert J. Havighurst, stated in a lecture recently that “the three most important
factors in child discipline are love, punishment, and consistency.”

Havighurst, professor of education at UC, pinpointed the problem of child-rearing as that
of training the child to conform to accepted social norms without destroying childish spon-

of political partisanship in fa-
vor of what a spokesman for
SRP called “a year of aims
accomplished.**

Committees were set up to work
toward the completion of a pre-
viously begun book co-operative,
and to investigate the possibilities
of a practical housing co-opera-
tive. A committee was formed to
continue SRP's cultural program,
and an educational committee

planned to bring such speakers
as Senator Fulbright and William
O. Douglas to campus.

A student needs committee to
work on educational problems on
campus and civil liberties issues,
as well as service projects, was
also planned.

taneity.

Working rules -to be fol-
lowed in achieving this equi-
librium between discipline and
spontaneity are, according to
Havighurst: “wait until the child
is biologically and physically
ready for any kind of training,”
“use as much reward and as little
punishment as possible,” “try to
teach the child to imitate persons
of prestige in the child’s eyes,”
and “rely on age-mates to teach
democratic self-discipline.”

Disciplinary measures involv-
ing punishment are indispensable
to child rearing, Havighurst
stated, for without any early re-
straining external force, the child
is unable to develop his own in-
ternal “controlling voice,”

Spanking effective

But love is a necessary comple-
ment to punishment, he added, for
a child who is not yet able to see
the rationale of his parents’ in-
structions accepts them in the
confidence that his parents love
him and that their instructions

are in some
own good.

But if the
parents, no

way meant foi his

child mistrusts his
amount of punish-

ment will compel him to -accept
those precepts which will be the
governors of his future behavior.

Spanking is an excellent form
of punishment, Havighurst stated,
for it can be administered quickly
after the child has misbehaved,
giving the very young child a
lasting association between his
misbehavior and its consequent
punishment.

Relaxed Piano Playing at

GOOD food...

by Bill Bathien

No form of discipline is effec-
tive if it is not applied with con-
sistency, he emphasized. If the
child is spanked one day for doing
something for which he is not
reprimanded on a previous day,
this inconsistency of discipline
will arrest the development of
his standards of good and bad.

Havighurst referred to a study
which attempted to correlate se-
verity and consistency of disci-
pline with effectiveness of disci-
pline. The study showed that
while consistency was of prime
importance, there was no correla-
tion between the severity of pun-
ishment and its effectiveness.

Creates hostility

The effects of both too much
and too little discipline can he
disastrous, he commented. Too
much discipline may create an
adult who is either very hostile
towards or very terrified of critic-
ism; too little discipline may cre-
ate an adult who is anxious and
fearful of his lack of self-control.

“Punishment teaches the child
to do right, but it also teaches
the child to avoid any situation
in which punishment might be
encountered,” he stated, citing

Editor's column

What explains ISL victory:
organization, issues, trend

What caused the ISL landslide?

Was it a question of the issues? Has the campus indeed
•‘gone conservative,” as one SRPer put it? Or was it rather a
case of many factors working together to bring about this
SRP downfall?

My own inclinations run with the latter explanation. The
questions of issues I feel composes only a part of the story.

It is true that the issues were more sharply drawn than
they had been in many years. Attacking the ISL brand of
student service, an SRPer called it “wire-cage” government.
An ISL candidate retorted that she liked “wire-cages not
wires” (of the telegraph variety).

SRP promised an ambitious service program but empha-
sized, non-local parts of their platform. In the ISL vs. SRP
debate sponsored by Student Forum, Marcus Raskin (SRP)
said, “Students are part of a greater society, and must ac-
knowledge their membership in this democratic society by
taking an active part in it.” A bit more to the point, Paul
Breslow (SRP president) said, “If students want to promote
academic freedom and civil rights, it is only through a group
such as SG that their ideas can be of any effectiveness.”

Speaking at the same meeting Clive Gray (ISL) said, “We
have found that students do not want to give this power (to
act as an organ of public expression of student opinion on
national and international issues) to SG; Students feel that
SG should concern itself with self-government and services.”
The election results would seem to bear out the Gray conten-
tion to some extent.

But does this increased interest in local issues really repre-
sent a campus gone more conservative?

The impression I get is that the entering students on all
levels, college and divisional, are indeed a bit more conserva-
tive, but only a bit more. Of more decisive importance, I think,
is the fact that most students have grown more apathetic
toward politics. They have not changed their political ideas;
they have lost interest in them. Some are afraid but most are
not; they are sick of crisis, conflict, and controversy and want
to be left alone. One student I talked to, epitomized this feel-
ing with the suggestion of an “Apathy Party,”-whose symbol
would be the sloth, which would do nothing, and whose dedi-
cated task would be to make sure that no other party did
anything either. “If I weren’t so apathetic,” he said facetious-
ly, “I’d start the party.”

SRP’s fiery platform could not have much influence over
students who were tired of fighting.

Also of great importance was the intensive campaign of the
ISL organization. The difference in attitude between the two
parties shows up in a remark made by an SRP leader after
losing the floor fight to extend the deadline on petitions. Ex-
plaining his party’s inability to get enough people on the ballot,
he said, “We were caught flatfooted. We thought we had an-
other week.” ISL, in contrast, not only knew when the petition
deadline date was but had been campaigning from the middle
of August. When the student activities handbook went put to
new students, Clive Gray’s picture was on the inside front
cover. During orientation week ISL people like AI Fortier,
Jolie Lasker, and Emil Johnson were everywhere. The untiring
Clive Gray must have met everybody in the entering class
at least once. On Student Activities night ISL held a party at
the Phi Gam house. And at the going-away party for Ed
Maupin, ex-Cap and Gown editor, Anton DePorte virtually
set up campaign headquarters in one corner of the living room.
No one would maintain that Gray’s, Fortier’s, Johnson’s or
Miss Lasker’s activities during orientation week were politi-
cally motivated, but it is characteristic that their political
value was not ignored. There was, in addition, much of, what
professional politicians call, precinct work, the bell-ringing
and button-holing included.

One may question the propriety of such intensity in the con-
duct of a student election but one may not question its effec-
tiveness.

Allen R. Janger

Leiters...

ISLer wants problems

However shocked, surprised,
disappointed, or pleased we may
be at the outcome of the SG elec-
tions, it does give ISL a challenge
to show what she can do given
ample opportunity.

It was perhaps an act of some
bad faith on my part to permit my
name to be placed on the ballot,
when I had no intention of devot-
ing much time to SG; I’m some-
what taken aback to find myself
again a member of the Govern-
ment. Nevertheless, I — not joy-
fully, but rather dutifully and yet
sincerely — urge anyone in my
Division (Soc. Sci.) or my Depart-
ment (Anthropology) to talk with
me or my SG colleagues about
their ideas and gripes about the
University and the surrounding
community, rather than immedi-
a t e 1 y and uncritically forming
some ad hoc committee, or —
worse — just burying their in-
spirations and frustrations in the
recesses of their souls. To those
who do not feel that they can be
adequately represented by an
ISLer I recommend Mr. Breslow,
who can, and does, quite force-
fully represent views somewhat
different from mine.

As problems I know to be of
particular interest here I suggest
the apparently continual reduc-
tion of library services, and the
situation in the University neigh-
borhood. Students are affected b\
the latter, because they are resi-
dents of this neighborhood, and
because any reputation in the
community established by the
South East Chicago Commission,
which is becoming increasingly
identified with the University,
will be inevitably to some extent
transferred to the University it
self and to the people who consti-
tute it, including the students.

Russ exchange
discussed

Clive Gray should be given con-
siderable credit for his thoughtful
and sensible position on U. S.-
Soviet exchange visits. The SRP
propaganda implying that Mr.
Gray somehow did not live up to
the ISL platform of the NSA elec-
tion is unjust and irresponsible;
this kind of nonsense does not

advance the case SRP is trying
to present. On the other hand
I would like, to suggest a recon-
sideration of Mr. Gray’s position
as presented in his letter in the
October 22 Maroon.

Mr. Gray mentioned the possi-
bility of negotiating with the Rus-
sians for more liberal terms and
stated that the NSA resolution
adopted “does not exclude Soviet
Russia; it simply gives NSA a
bargaining position lor setting up
a type of Soviet exchange that
will be fruitful.”

First, it is not clear what Mr.
Gray means by a “bargaining posi-
tion.” Bargaining with the Rus-
sians is strictly a horse-trading
operation, and laying down condi-
tions for a more constructive type
of exchange program would con-
stitute a “bargaining position” in
a sense only if we had something
to trade which would induce the
Russians to accept such a set of
conditions. It does not seem likely
that we can do anything to accom-
plish this, for free interchange of
ideas is not only distinctly not in
the interest of the Russian dicta-
torship, but if carried very far
could be exceedingly dangerous
to the Russian regime.

Second, rather than take any
of the risk which a more liberal
program would involve, the Rus-
sians would be likely to refuse
more liberal terms and blame the
failure of the negotiations on the
Americans, citing it as proof that
the U. S. does not want peace
and negotiation, and thus obtain-
ing a propaganda benefit perhaps
equivalent to that which is the
Russian purpose in any "ex-
ch a n g e program” in the first
place.

Third, since the Russians can
use any breakdown in negotia-
tions, excluding them from our
exchange program would not
seem to be much of a bargaining
threat in obtaining more liberal

terms. The Russian propaganda
machine is a massive piece of
apparatus.

Fourth, is it not therefore pos-
sible that in the war of propa-
ganda we would fare about as
badly by refusing the Russian
terms as by accepting them?

Mr. Gray is rightly concerned
about student exchange with Rus-
sia under present conditons lead-
ing to very little “understanding”
but serving mainly as publicity
stunts for Russian progaganda.
That is exactly the purpose of
tours for foreign students Im Rus-
sia; if the Russian government
were interested in the “free ex-
change of ideas,” it would permit
its citizens to travel freely abroad.
1 suspect there are plenty of com-
missars who could afford vaca-
tions in Western Europe, and that
might be nice even for people
living in the Paradise including
a few canard-pushing generals.

Though the Russian pinpose in
arranging tours for foreign stu-
dents is propaganda, there may
be results which do not exactly
fit that purpose. Visits by Ameri-
cans would seem to encourage
curiosity about the U. S., interest
in visitng the U. S., and curiosity
about restrictions on foreign trav-
el. These things are important
whether or not the Russian gov-
ernment actually permitted for-

Crisis to reconstruction'
final Walgreen lecture

“ Two great challenges confronted the Protestant denomina-
tions toward the end of the 19th century — one directed at
their system of thought, the other aimed at the social welfare
program, ’ said Sidney E. Mead, associate professor of history
of American Christianity, last Friday in the final lecture of
the Walgreen series. Subject of the lecture was “From crisis

to reconstruction.”

The great labor strikes of
the 1890’s disturbed many
clergymen, and led many of them
to believe that since workers con-
tribute to the product, they de-
serve personal rights and equity.
Mead pointed out that many of
these clergy felt that the workers
should be satisfied through social
work projects so that they would
not turn to political solutions.
“The appeal of labor to politics
is the first step to socialism,”
argued one church leader of the
era.

Philanthropy questioned

These feelings finally led to a
questioning of the use of philan-
thropy as practiced at that time.
An effort was made to get at the
causes of the social problems
which lie in the industrial system
itself, rather than simply to treat
the effects. Many churchmen felt
that the economic system itself
was at fault.

The “social gospel” movement,
decrying the “impersonality of
the machine,” was the strongest
attacker of the laissez-faire eco-
nomic system, argued Mead. It
also represented a reaction
against the individualism of piet-
ism, which had largely become
identified with the economic svs-
tem.

Fundamentalism vs.

“social gospel”

The growth of fundamentalism
within the Protestant denomina-
tions was in part a reaction
against the social gospel move-
ment. “Fundamentalism was the-
ologically conservative, but in
other ways was purely reaction-
ary,” said Mead. “It tended to by-

eign visits by Russian students,
and whether or not our own au-
thorities are so foolish as to re-
fuse visas. Impressions created
by American visitors of friendli.
ness, desire for peace, interest in
and respect for the Russian peo-
ple may be more important than
the effect of Russian efforts to
advertise the Workers Paradise.
It might therefore be better to
go ahead and accept Russian in-
vitations to American students,
obviously proffered for Russian
purposes, and to use such oppor-
tunities for our own purposes as
best we can. But I think it is mis-
leading to talk about “understand-
ing” and “easing tensions” with
Russia by so doing; after all the
ruling groups in Russia have as
much of a vested interest in main-
taining fear of the U. S. as many
American business groups have
in promoting a blind hysteria over
“communism” and socialist eco-
nomic ideas.

pass thinking entirely and it
never came to terms with the
modern world. It eventually end-
ed up as nothing more than a po-
litical power group in the denum-
inatfons.”

For a while, the “social gospel'’
movement reigned supreme, but
“the depression of 1929-1937 blast-
ed much of the faith in that move-
ment,” Mead claimed.

Darwin versus religion

The attack on the system <>f
thought of the denominations was
in large part represented by Dar-
winians. “Now the issue between
science and religion could not tie
ignored . . . the denominations
seemed in danger of floundering
and for a while confusion
reigned,” said Mead.

Neither of these challenges has
been clearly resolved, and recent-
ly there has been a general stir-
ring and re-evaluating within the
Protestant denominations, he con-

known as the tutorial BA.
The second alternative

is the
a year

of work in one of four graduate
areas. Social sciences, law, busi-
ness, and the graduate library
school participate in this pro-
gram. The degree is offered by
the college when the student has
completed the work required of
him in the college, and the college

has received notification of
year’s successful study in the
vision or school.

The joint degrees offered
the college and the physical :
ences, biological sciences, or

a
di-

sci-
hu-

manities divisions offer the third
route.

The general studies BA was
designed as a further extension
of the expiring college program
of liberal education. A high school
graduate is required to take up
to twelve comprehensives, as de-
termined by his placement tests.
This would usually result in a
maximum of three years’ work.
After that he is engaged in one
year of tutorial studies under a
tutor assigned by the new college
council of tutorial studies. Writ-
ing a bachelor’S essay is one of
the requirements of his tutorial
year.

Professional work optional

High school graduates who do
a year of professional option
work in social sciences, law, busi-
ness, and the library school also
have a maximum of three years
in the college. In this program,
as well as that for the tutorial
BA, students who have not com-
pleted high school may be re-

Broonzy, Terry spark concert, Seeger poor

Saturday night’s Mandel hall folk concert was interesting, but in some ways a disappointment.

The most striking feature of the concert was the performance of Big Bill Broonzy, one of the last of the great blues gui-
tarists of the “northern migration” generation. His blues are in the backwoods Mississippi tradition, but sing of the prob-
lems of city life met by the newly arrived rural Negroes of the South.

Showing a great self-assurance that was absent in his appearance here previously, he convincingly put the blues across
to an audience that was essentially unfamiliar with .the idiom. If this is his usual performance, it is easy to understand his
immense popularity in Europe.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terry harmonica virtuoso

Sonny Terry amply demon-
strated his virtuosity on the
single-tone harmonica, of which

A scene from the Giradoux
fantasy, “The Enchanted,” to
be presented by LT November
18 through 20.

he is unquestionably the greatest
living master. His performance
suffered, however, from a boister-
ous over-enthusiasm that ob-
scured the fine, gentle beauty of
his North Carolina hill country
blues.

He warmed to his audience with
too great a gusto, and slurred
over some of the finer points of

his playing in an effort to instill since his tour with the Weavers,

Ghostly fantasy, Giradoux's 'Enchanted'
to be presented by UT in the round

"To be friendly with ghosts is to be ghostly.”

This is perhaps the least controversial of the many divergent points of view brought to
light by Jean Giradoux in his dramatic fantasy, The Enchanted. This play, a success since
its Paris premiere in 19333s now being rehearsed at University Theater for production on
November 18, 19, 20, 21, 27, and 28. Tickets are on sale in the Reynolds club. /

"The successful staging of fantasy, poetic or farcical, is one of the perennial problems of

the vigor the audience seemed to
demand. In his duets with Broon-
zy, his unfamiliarity with Big

actors and directors,” com-
mented Marvin Phillips, UT
director. ‘‘Given a convention-
al. realistic play, an unimagin-
ative company can always fall
back on a conventional realistic
staging. Giradoux provides no
such out.”

Tn meeting this problem. Phil-
lips and his associates are pre-
scnting the play completely in the
round, giving the actors exits,
entrances and occasionally speech-
es in the midst of the audience.

The actors are being encour-
aged to depend as little as possible
on sets and props, allowing the
audience to work with the cast
in creating the. small, unreal
world in which the action seems
to occur.

Working closely with Phillips
is his assistant director, Roswitha
Kroemer, who has been individ-
ually coaching the actors and con-
ducting rehearsals which Phil-

Beenson, Omar Shapli, Jim Sher-
wood, Federic Hirsch, Lynn Alex-
ander, Ray Patinkin, Anadel Sny-
der, Carol Horning, Laurie Rich-
ardson, Robert Kirtler, and Bill
Tsokos.

The play will be presented in
UT’s studio theater on the third
floor of the Reynolds club.

Pete Seeger, who proved io be
a disappointment to the audi-
ence at Mandel hall, last Satur-
day.

Bill’s style of play hampered both
musicians.

Seeger big disappointment

The big disappointment of the
concert was Seeger, and he failed
not in his vocal or instrumental
skill, which has in fact grown sur-
prisingly over the past few years

but in what is reputed to be his
forte—judging the mood and de-
sires of his audience. He “talked
down” to his audience—presum-
ing less of a familiarity with the
American folk idiom than they
actually possessed.

Too many group songs

In addition he thrust group song
after group song on an audience
that had obviously come expect-
ing an “all-star” folk concert, not
a song-fest.

In all justice to Seeger, one
must point out that he was having
a great deal of trouble toning
down a “cutting contest” between
Broonzy and Terry. These color-
ful “fast quip and hard riff”
broadsides enliven a jam session,
but as scores of folk and jazz con-
certs have demonstrated, there is
a vast difference between 20 mu-
sicians in a basement flat and
three musicians before an audi-
ence of over 1.000. The quips and
jibes were amusing at first, but
as they went on became rather
annoying.

UC fertile field for folk concerts

Though not outstandingly suc-
cessful, this concert again showed
that the UC community provides
a fertile field for folk concerts of

this type.

'Mr. Hulot's Holiday

gem of

humor, originality, and warmth

Mr. Hulot’s Holiday, now showing at the Surf, is a gem of humor, originality and warmth.
Jacques Tati, the director, writer, and primary actor, has achieved in this film a mastery
of his light, consummate, near-slapstick touch.

The setting: a summer seaside resort; the varied, distinct, typical people; the very appro-
priate rhythmic, gay, somewhat bluesy music, and the abrupt, brief, flitting scenes; all make
for a fast-moving yet nostalgic atmosphere.

Tati’s approach consists
in utilizing everyday inci-
dents for their natural
comic value and for their po-
tential of character delineation.
He provides inventive twists for
.such incidents as a ping-pong
ball disrupting a card game, or
hotel room's lighting up one by
one because of a loud noise, or
a woman with a small dog
crossing the street against traf-

result is the creation of a very
meaningful and thoroughly
unique personality.

Tati himself plays the part of
Mr. Hulot, a moral, polite, awk-
ward and singularly self-conscious
vacationer. He is constantly get-
ting into situations of extraordi-
nary confusion, such as being
locked in a cabin full of exploding
firecrackers, falling backward
from a threshhold down a steep
incline with his arms full of suit-
cases, or going sailing in a boat
which has just been sawed in half.

Yet Tati, as he approaches

point of it, i n c 1 u d e s scenes

Cross country runners
post perfect scores

The UC harriers added to
their winning streak in spec-
tacular fashion last Saturday
by crushing teams from Wis-
consin State Teachers College
and Wright Jr. College with
scores of 15 to 48 and-15 to 44,

runners as preparation for the

State, Nebraska, and Kansas
State at Ames, Iowa, was highly
gratifying in its own light. Walt
Deike’s sizzling 15:30 time broke
the old varsity three-mile record
by 25 seconds, and last year’s five-
and seven-man team records were
shattered by 414 and 10-minutes,

THE INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT
OF NED FUTTY

Chloe McColgate was a beautiful coed who majored in psych and
worked in the I.Q. testing department of the university. She did
not work there because she needed money; she worked there because
she loved and admired intelligence above all things. “I love and
admire intelligence above all things,” is the way she succinctly put it.

Ned Futty, on the other hand, was a man who could take intelli-
gence or leave it alone. What he loved and admired above all things
was girls. “What I love and admire above all things is girls,” is
the way he put it.

One day Ned saw Chloe walking by on the campus. “Holy Toledo!”
he exclaimed. “How sweetly flows that liquefaction of her clothes!”

The following day he saw her walking past again. “Great balls of
fire!” he exclaimed. “Next, when I cast mine eyes and see that brave
vibration each way free, O, how that glittering taketh me!”

When he saw her again the next day, he could no longer contain
himself. He ran up and blocked her way. “Excuse me,” he said,
tugging his forelock, “I am Ned Futty and I love you beyond the
Baying of it. Will you be mine?”

2

She looked at his quarter-inch haircut, his black rimmed glasses,
his two-day beard, his gamy T-shirt, his tattered jeans, his de-
composing tennis shoes. “You are not unattractive,” she admitted,
“but for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is what I require
in a man.”

“I’m smart as a whip” said Ned with a modest blush. “Back home
everybody always said, ‘You got to get up pretty early in the morning
to get ahead of old Ned Futty?”

“Maybe so,” said Chloe, “but if you don’t mind, I’d like to make
sure. Will you come into the I.Q. testing department with me?”

“With yx>u I would go into a malted milk machine,” cried Ned
Futty and laughed and smote his thigh and bit Chloe’s nape in an
excess of passion and high spirits. Scampering goatlike, he followed
her into the I.Q. testing department.

“First I will test your vocabulary,” said Chloe.

“Shoot!” said Ned gaily and licked her palm.

“What does juxtaposition mean?”

“Beats me,” he confessed cheerily*

“How about ineffable?”

“Never heard of it,” smiled Ned, plunging his face into her clavicle.
“Furtive?”

“With fur on?” said Ned doubtfully.

new and different

Chloe sighed. “How are you on arithmetic?” she asked.

“A genius,” he assured her.

“What’s the difference between a numerator and a denominator?”

“My feeling exactly!” said Ned with an approving nod. “What’s
the difference?”

“If a man earns fifty dollars a month,” said Chloe, “and saves 12%
of his earnings, how long would it take him to save $100?”

“Forever,” said Ned. “Who can save anything on $50 a month?”

“How do you find a square root?”

“How should I know?” replied Ned, giggling. “I’m no square.”

“How are you on English?” asked Chloe.

“I speak it fluently,” said Ned with quiet pride.

“What is the present tense of wrought?"

“Wreet,” replied Ned, clutching Chloe to him and dancing 32 bars
of the Maxixe.

“Next I will test you for manual dexterity,” said Chloe. She handed
him a board punched full of oddly shaped holes and a collection of
oddly shaped pegs. “Fit the pegs in the holes,” she instructed him.

“Let’s neck instead,” suggested Ned.

“Maybe later,” said Chloe. “First the pegs.”

He fumbled about for a longish interval. Finally he tired of it and
reached for Chloe.

But she fended him off. “Ned Futty,” she said, “you are dumb.
You have the highest dumbness score of anybody I have ever tested.
Consequently I cannot be your girl, for I love and admire intelligence
above all things.”

He hurled himself on the floor and clasped her about the knees.
“But I love you!” he cried in anguish. “Do not send me from you, or
you will make my world a sunless place — full of dim and fearful
shapes!”

“I am sorry,” she answered, “but you are too dumb.”

“Reconsider, madam,” he begged, “else a miasm looms before me.”
“Go,” she said coldly.

Spent and speechless, he struggled to his feet. With leaden steps
he made his painful way to the door. There he stopped and lit a
cigarette. Then he opened the door and started away to his gray and
grisly future.

“Stay!” called Chloe.

He turned.

“Was that,” she asked, “a Philip Morris you just lit?”
“Yes,” he said.

“Then cpme to me and b<^ my love!” cried Chloe joyously. “For
you are not dumb! You are smart! Anybody is smart to smoke
Philip Morris with its fine vintage tobaccos, its cool relaxing mild-

ness, its superior taste, its snap-open pack. Ned, l^ver, give me a
cigarette and marry me!”

And they smoked happily ever after.

an untested team Thursday, since Ed Davis is the only returning
letterman. Veterans Dave Penn and Bob Wieseneck will also be on
hand, plus newcomers John Davey, Ray Hardvall, Gareth Nelson,
and Joe Wolff. Last year the JVers won the league championship,
but dropped the post-season playoff in the final game.

WAA plays badminton, volleyball

The Women’s Athletic association is definitely not ready for foot-
ball. Competing in badminton at Navy Pier play day, Evelyn Lee
and Jane Bitterman won the consolation doubles tournament, and
Elaine Kostopoulos was runner-up in the consolation singles tourney.
In volleyball the Chicago team lost to Chicago Teachers and Con-
cordia. In hockey they lost to the Chicago Hockey association in a
game Sunday, and tied Faulkner School on Monday, by scores of
2-1 and 1-1, respectively. Monday’s game was marked by high winds
and damp snow, indicating that WAA has the spirit if not the skill
for a “move into the big time.”

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Merrie Men mail protests;

seven hundred sign soap

Seven hundred signatures were received this week in a campus-wide campaign to support
the censure of Senator McCarthy.

Robin Hood’s Merrie Men initiated the campaign last week when it was learned that a
“national rally for Joe McCarthy” was being formed, and that this rally, to be held in Wash-
ington next Thursday, three days after the Senate convenes, was receiving large response.

“Robin Hood believes there is a danger of a whitewash of the Watkins Committee cen-
sure recommendation,” said
Suzanne Friedmann, Secre-
tary of the Merrie Men, “and

the only way its passage can be
assured is to express mass sup-
port for it.”

As a medium for expression of
this support, students have been
signing tags, wired through hotel-
size bars of soap, stamped “Don’t
Whitewash McCarthy—Vote Cen-
sure.” and addressed to the Sen-
ate. Arrangements are now being
made with Senator Flanders to
communicate the tags.

Contacts universities

In connection with its efforts to
organize student support of the
censure. Robin Hood has contact-
ed 50 universities, warning

Action from the University of
Wisconsin, the University of Mich-
igan and Hunter College have re-
plied with encouraging requests
for information and suggestions.
The indications are that projects
similar to the one at UC are being
organized at the above campuses.

Members of Robin Hood de-
scribed UC response as “strongly
anti-McCarthy.” At the same time
they deplored the lack of under-
standing, on the part of many stu-
dents. as to the importance of the
censure motion, and the lack of
enthusiasm which resulted.

’Laying low’

“McCarthy is merely laying low
point,” stated Maggie

them at this

of a possible whitewash, and urg-
ing them to become active in
favor of the motion.

The Students For Democratic

Solomon appeals
write-in votes

Nash. “Where McCarthyism was
an issue, it was defeated in the
primaries and in the elections.
Now McCarthy is stirring again,
and has made new threats and
reiterated old ones.”

“It is possible,” remarked Joel
Picheny, “that McCarthy is count-

ing largely on his ‘National Ral-
ly.’ ” He may try to organize a
mass pro-McCarthy movement to
exert pressure on the Senate for
the duration of the censure con-
sideration. Unfortunately, there
are senators who are not certain
which way public sentiment lies,
and who may be affected by such
a demonstration.”

Predict filibuster

Bob Jonas thought that “Mc-
Carthy might try to prevent a
vote ’til January with a filibuster.
The censure resolution expires if
it is not acted on before the new
Congress convenes. U. S. News
and World Report indicated the
filibuster as a possibility, and I
don’t think it should be taken
lightly.”

The Robin Hood club plans to
send to various universities the
clipping on its campaign that was
printed in Tuesday’s Sun-Times,
together with samples of the soap-
tags.

Nash, and Karl Rodman gather about the table.

The issue of write-in votes in
Student Government elections will
be taken to the Student-Faculty-
Administration court, Fred Solo-
mon announced this week.

Solomon (Ind> received eight
write-in votes for an uncontested
seat in the medical school but the
votes were not counted by the
election and rules committee of
SG. The committee, according to
Jim Handler, who was at that
time chairman of the group, in-
terpreted the law. “Any writing
on a ballot shall render the ballot
void.” to include names written-in.

Solomon will argue in the court
that it is inconsistent with the
Student Code, which calls for a
democratically elected Student
Government, to discount write-ins.

In the October 26 SG meeting
Jerry Zisook (ISL-hum) and oth-
ers speaking in Solomon’s behalf
had argued that the interpreta-
tion of the law was incorrect, and
should be construed to exclude
names written in. The point was
ruled out of order.

“Since the seat should rightful-
ly be mine, I naturally will not
apply to fill the vacancy in the
medical school until the SFA
court has acted,” Solomon said.
He hopes to bring the case up be-
fore November 30.

BEST FOR YOU. . . no cigarette can satisfy you like
a Chesterfield, because Chesterfield has the right combination
of the world's best tobaccos. Only the tobaccos that are highest
in quality, low in nicotine, and the most pleasure to smoke.

Change to Chesterfields now. Smoke them regular or
king size. You’ll understand why Chesterfield is the largest
selling cigarette in America's Colleges.
