College loses Ward

Ward leaves UC for India

The resignation of F. Champion Ward as dean of the College and the appointment of
Robert E. Streeter, associate dean and associate professor of English, as his successor were
announced yesterday by Chancellor Kimpton.

Ward’s resignation will be effective Jan. 31, when he leaves for India to act as educa-
tional representative in India for the Division of Overseas Activities of the Ford Founda-
tion. In the autumn of 1955, he will return to the College as professor of humanities.

Ward told the MAROON
that he had been offered the
Ford Foundation position last
year, but he had felt he should
delay his resignation until the
new undergraduate programs had
been acted upon. In relation to the
new degrees, Ward said, “Last
spring I was discouraged about
the College, but not tired. I’m not
discouraged now, but I am, tired.
Mr. Streeter is neither.”

“I’ve been dean seven years,”
Ward continued, “and that’s a
rather dubious record. No ad-
ministrative office in the College
should have one incumbent for
too long.”

In his resignation speech to the
College faculty, last December 17,
Ward said, “When the Chancel-
lor, himself newly appointed at
the time, asked me to accept reap-
pointment as dean, I accepted only
with the proviso that I might re-
sign before a second term and my

colleagues were exhausted. Be-
cause of the quality and innova-
tive spirit of its faculty, the dean-
ship of this College is the most
interesting administrative posi-
tion in American higher educa-
tion (I sometimes think, the only
interesting position), but for this
very reason it should and can be

‘handed ’round!’ ”

Ward told the MAROON yester-
day, “I’m frankly excited at the
prospect of 20 months in India.
I’ll be traveling all over the coun-
try in order to be able to learn
about educational efforts which
might use Ford funds to best ad-
vantage. The amount of literacy
is at present small and the gov-
ernment’s commitment grandiose;
the Constitution promises univer-
sal education up to the age of
14.”

“I’ll be glad to get back to
teaching, too,” Ward continued.
“I’m tired of writing and reading
only prefaces.”

Ward came to the UC faculty
from Denison University in 1945
and succeeded Clarence H. Faust
as dean in 1947. He took his B.A.
and his M.A. at Oberlin and re-
ceived his Ph.D. from Yale.

Ward’s last public appearance
as dean of the College will be at

Streeter heads College;
likes program, professors

“I think we have a good program, and a lot of expert
and devoted teachers to carry it out,” stated the new dean
of the College, Robert E. Streeter. “And we also have a
lively bunch of students.”

Streeter, who is now Associate Dean of the College, will
assume his new duties about February 1 when the present
Dean, F. Champion Ward,
leaves for India.

Commenting on the recent
changes in the College program,
Streeter said, “It was apparent
for a variety of reasons that we
had worked our way into a bad
position relative 'to the high
schools. Some adjustment had to
be made. “However, it is difficult
to tell how the modifications de-
cided upon last Spring will work
out.”

Streeter, who is 37, came to
UC in 1947 as associate professor
of English. In 1951 he was made
chairman of the college English
department, -a post which he held
until October, 1953, when he be-
came associate Dean of the Col-
lege.

farm collectivization described

Last year’s Student Government exchange students to Eu-

many and spent some time among refugees in Berlin and in
Israel, and David Cummings who studied at Zagreb in Yugo-

these three countries last Wednesday.

the big East German collective

what the thousands of refugees
who escape into West Berlin
think of the success of collectivis-
ation in the new German Peoples
Republic. Generally there are only
two kinds of peasants that join
the collectives voluntarily, says
Levine, those that do not own any
land of their own and hope to
escape hard work as hired farm-
hands and those functionaries
who expect to do administrative
work in collective rather than
manual labor. Independent farm-
ers, however, are forced to re-
linquish their land by imposition
of such high quotas on crops that
it is impossible to meet them. The
program of collectivisation was

K. J. Hollinger,
UC prof, dies

Karl J. Holzinger, profes-
sor of educational statistics
at UC since 1929, died on
the morning of January 15.
The cause of his death was a
heart attack.

Holzinger, who was 61, had
been a member of the UC faculty
for 34 years. Among the posts
which he held at various times
were the presidency of the Psy-
chometric Society in 1941 and the

vice-presidency of the American
Statistical Association in 1933.

Author and co-author of ten
books, he was also editor of the
Journal of Educational Psychol-
ogy since 1941. Tn 1941 he. was
awarded the prize of the Educa-
tion Research Association.

Holzinger taught mathematics
at the University of Kansas and
the University of Minnesota be-
fore coming to UC. He also served
with the Psychology Corps in the
first World War.

Holzinger received his bache-
lor’s and master’s degrees from
the University of Minnesota in
1915 and 1917, respectively and
his doctor of philosophy degree
summa cum laude from UC in
1922.

ever, are rarely qualified by their
training in agriculture, but by
their proficiency in ideology. Peo-
ples Policemen and active com-
munists who go out into the coun-
try to try to convince the populace
of the advantages of the new form
of life, receive rude shocks when
they see the actual practice of
collectivization. Many join the
stream of refugees into West Ber-
lin which has become so large
that land is laying untilled and
some villages have lost their en-
tire populations.

Going on to talk about Israel,
Levine indicated that the collec-
tive idea can be made to work
when it does not grow out of
marxist ideology but from practi-
cal necessity. This is proven by
the Kibbutzim of Israel, which Le-
vine characterized as “relatively
isolated utopias.” Many of the
early settlers in Israel, used to
higher standards of living were
undersold on the native labor mar-
ket and therefore had to look for
a new way of life independent of
the Arab economy. There are two
types of Kibbutz today, small
units of 100 to 150 persons and

Strozier-SG agreement sought as
SG Recognition group report

After hearing Eli Stein (ISL-Phi-Sci), chairman of the Committee on Recognized Student Organiza-
tions, report on Dean Strozier's compromise proposal on the Michigan Plan, the Student Government
authorized CORSO to continue discussions with the Administration for another week. SG indicated a will-
ingness to consider amending the present Michigan Plan, which would require immediate derecognition of

Phi Delta Theta to grant
the UC fraternity recogni-
tion until Oct. 15, 1954. By
that date the fraternity’s dis-
criminatory membership
clause would have to be removed
or repudiated; otherwise the UC
chapter of Phi Delta Theta would
have to leave the campus.

Kracke reviews historical development
of Confucian thought in China's politics

Chinese political theory was examined by Edward A. Kracke, associate professor of
Chinese, last Monday evening. He was the third speaker in a series of lectures on China
sponsored by the Committee on Far Eastern Civilizations. His efforts were directed prin-
cipally to explaining the Confucian concept of government and evaluating its far-reaching

influence on Chinese political
Tse Tung.

The feudal government out-
lined by Confucius (551 - 479
B.C.) was one of men rather
than law and had as its guiding
principle “the less government
the better,” Kracke began. At its
head was a patriarchal monarch
—an emperor who considered the
people as his family. He pro-
tected them, presented an exam-
ple of honest and principled living
for them to imitate, and worship-
ped for them, maintaining contin-
uous harmony between heaven
and earth. His advisors and offi-

national convention of September
votes by three-quarters to remove
the discriminatory clause, or fail-
ing that, the UC chapter repudi-
ates the clause. The Dean and SG
agreed that Phi Delta Theta
would have to repudiate its clause
or leave campus, if the three-
quarter vote is not attained. How-
ever, according to the Phi Delta
Theta constitution, a three-quar-
ter vote must be obtained in 1954,
and again in ’56, before any consti-
tutional change is effected. The
only apparent difference between

thought, which extends even i
cials were chosen from the people
by civil service methods, for wis-
dom and character, rather than
family name.

The accumulated teachings of
ancient songs and stories, coupled
with Confucius’ simple ethics, be?
came the unwritten constitution
of the land. The people obeyed
their rules unfailingly, but were
allowed the freest amount of
criticism. Education and gentle
persuasion, Confucius was con-
vinced, would bringout the nat-
ural law of goodness within every-
one.

the Dean’s stand and that taken
by SG centered around what
would be required of the frater-
nity should the three-quarters
vote against the discriminatory
clause be achieved in the national
convention.

Aubrey Galyon, ISL majority
leader, said, “that a three-quarter
vote in the 1954 national conven-
tion would therefore not definitely
relieve this chapter from the pro-
visions of the discriminatory
clause, until the final repeal were
achieved in 1956.”

o the current regime of Mao

However, “an altered envir-
onment produced new govern-
ment practices,” Kracke contin-
ued; China was becoming a com-
plex urban and commercial na-
tion and many of Confucius’ rus-
tic ideas were neglected. An at-
tempt to reconcile his teachings
and the new age in the 11th Cen-
tury became bogged down when
“rule by unhampered dependence
on character became encroached
on by numerous laws and rules
for picking ‘men of character.’ ”

Breslow opposed to further extensions

Paul Breslow (Soc Sci), SRP
minority leader, who proposed the
resolution be adopted, said that he
was personally opposed to grant-
ing further extensions to Phi
Delta Theta. “Since the majority
party,” he continued, “has been
negotiating with the administra-
tion, they should carry it to com-
pletion. Stein, in speaking for
Breslow’s motion, said that his
committee had maintained a posi-
tion in agreement with the sense
of the motion.

“The Big Questions” and “Knowledge is Power” were the
topics discussed by George S. Pettee, deputy director of the
Operations Research Office at Johns Hopkins University, in
the fourth and fifth of the six-lecture Walgreen Foundation
series, presented January 18 and 20.

Pettee was far more optimistic in these lectures than he had
been earlier in the series. He
continued to emphasize the
seriousness of our present mili-
tary problems, “the genuine dan-
ger presented by our powerful,
calculating enemy which makes
it so di ficult for us rt once to
defend ourselves, hold Western
Europe, develop a crippling atom-
ic attack, and maintain trans-
oceanic communication. We need
ruthless integrity and rigor of
thought.” But he also seemed
hopeful that we now have a mili-
tary organization which is capable
of doing a fairly decent job.

Sets specific goals

Not all of the two lectures were
devoted to statements of prob-
lems, however. Pettee also out-
lined the steps vital to their solu-
tion .noting our increasing de-
pendence on scientists and science
to solve problems which scien-
tists and science cannot solve.
Considerations of manpower
costs, allowance for obsolescence,
and economic practicality of ideas
for example, cannot be easily in-
cluded in a scientist’s calculations
— particularly in a short time.

Certainly, however, we must
“achieve a workable official atti-
tude which will help us to solve
specific problems demanding
progressively better techniques of
solution. We must find a basis for
mobilization, a central and work-
able system of planning, and some
formulation of long-run budget-
ary policy.”

Decisions produce decisions

The necessity for the right solu-
tions to these problems led Pettee
to an analysis of the methods of
making decisions. He spoke of
mental events leading to deci-

Keon, the Charles F. Grey Dis-

According to Pettee, there are
four major ways of decision-
making open to us; judicial (by
“due process”), political (involv-
ing psychological considerations),
the scientific (exact but time-
consuming), and command (rec-
ommended in military questions).

Of course, dependence on com-
mand decisions assumes that the
public is sufficiently well-
informed to understand the rea-
sons for them. “Although it is dif-
ficult to inform the public enough
to keep them from being ‘deaf,
wrong-headed, and brutal,’ it is
both necessary and possible that
the public be informed,’ concluded
Pettee.

Foreign policy
center in danger

Lack of funds has put the Cen-
ter for the Study of American
Foreign Policy in danger of being
forced to abandon its research
projects next fall, according to
Hans J. Morgenthau, director of
the center and Professor of Po-
litical science -at UC. The center
was established in 1950 under a
grant, which is due to expire on
Oct. 1, 1954, from the Lilly En-
dowment.

The purpose of the center, ac-
cording to Morgenthau, is to con-
tribute to the better understand-
ing of the principles, objectives
and probable results of American
foreign policies. The research in
which the center is engaged has
as its main focus the national in-
terest of the United States as re-
vealed in the objective conditions
of American existence and in the
foreign policies persued by the
US. As a result of its research the
center has published “Ideas and
Self-interest in American Foreign
Policy,” by Robert Osgood, and
will publish “Benjamin Franklin
and American Foreign Policy,” by
Gerald Stourzh, in February.

Completion of several other
projects in preparation is endan-
gered by the termination of the
Lilly Endowment grant. An emer-
gency appropriation from the
Rockefeller Foundations has been
granted to carry the center
through to the end of the year.

A CAMPUS-TO-CAREER CASE HISTORY

“During the spring of ’52—my last year
at the University of Maryland—I was in-
terviewed by a number of companies. I
was about to get my B.S. degree in
accounting.

“It seemed to me that there was a great
deal to be learned from the way I was
interviewed. Bell System interviewers
took their time about job offers. They
didn’t rush me or themselves.

“I had two talks with the Bell inter-
viewers and then was invited to meet and
talk with department heads. Not only
did they get a chance to look me over,
but I also had an opportunity to get a
closer look at their operation. I figured
if the Bell System was that careful in se-
lecting its men, it is careful in other
things. The interview was the tip-off.

“That’s why I’m working here in Wash-
ington, D. C., for one of the Bell Com-

panies—The Chesapeake & Potomac
Telephone Company. My first job—after
general training—was supervising a bill-
ing unit with 20 employees.

“Since then I have assisted on internal
audits in all departments. I’ve helped with
special studies for management and have
become better acquainted with operations
of the entire company. Now I’m working
on the general books as an accounting
supervisor. -

tainly meant a lot to me.”

An American who recently returned from China gave a
talk last Friday at the Family Study Center on family life
in the Chinese People’s Republic. William Hinton, an agricul-
tural specialist, returned five months ago after six months
work in China.

Hinton described family life under the old Chinese regime
as complete control of chil-
dren’s lives, including mar-

riage arrangements, by their par-
ents. Girls were brought to their
husband’s homes to perform hard
labor for their mothers-in-law.
Women .were completely domin-
ated by their husbands, and were
unable to obtain divorces.

Land reform instituted

Hinton went on to discuss the
attempts of the present Chinese
government to improve these con-
ditions by liberating women and
instituting new marriage laws. An
economic basis for this liberation

committees.... In the third place,
I would object to the authority of
the committee, under the statute
by which it was created by Con-
gress, to inquire into my writings
or my political views.”

O’Connor was cited for con-
tempt of the United States Senate

His case has received wide sup-

which gave approximately half
an acre of land to every rural
man, woman, and child.

Agriculture took a new form as
several families cooperated in a
mutual assistance type of farm-
ing, the work being shared by
women who had previously been
allowed only indoor activities. In
this connection, Hinton remarked
that every person receives a share
in the harvest in proportion to the
amount of work he contributes.
There is a 15 per cent tax on the
normal harvest, all above normal
yield being tax free.

Women liberated

Women can now sell their land
and obtain divorces. The new mar-
riage law limiting marriage to
men over 20 and women over 18
is very popular with the youth,
Hinton stated. Marriage is effect-
ed largely by free choice. The new
status of women is reflected in
the fact that over half of the med-
ical students in the country are
women, and there are many wom-
en engineers, Hinton concluded.

Hits MAROON

Whether it be prejudice or incompe-
tent journalism, I do not pretend to
know. However, the coverage given to
the CORSO hearing on the 13th of Jan-
uary in Reynolds Club, reported In the
January 15th issue of the Chicago
MAROON is, by right of major omis-
sions, most Inadequate. We realize that
space demands deletion; but we do note
a curious pattern that they seem to
follow. In order to aid in the clarifica-
tion of the Isues discussed, I ask that
you publish this letter in unedited
form.

Though in the paraphrased questions
and answers you correctly state that
the fraternity — at this time — will
neither admit nor deny Student Gov-
*rnment jurisdiction in this matter;
previously (in the same article) you
write, "King . . . will not admit that
SG has jurisdiction in this area.” This
is, in itself, correct; howeverl attempted
to make clear that until such time as
Student Government precisely defines
Its powers (to protect its own integrity),
and the point at which they cease (to
protect ours) we are unable to regard
their jurisdictional claims as anything
but nebulous. We certainly have no ten-
able grounds to yet deny them that
right, as your article implies, but we
are not foolhardy enough to present
them with a signed blank check either.

You report that I said it is doubtful
that our chapter will support the sus-
pended chapters at Amherst and Wil-
liams unless they recant. This, too, is
correct, but alone quite inadequate.
Speaking informally with one of the
MAROON reporters after the hearing,
I explained that it was inconceivable,
in my mind, that the Williams and
Amhurst chapters would be reinstated
unless they agree to abide by the con-
stitutional restraints a part of mem-
bership in our organization, and that
this necessarily followed If the inter-
national fraternity was to avoid nullify-
ing its own constitution by tolerating
Internal contradiction. You also omit-
ted that our chapter is in total agree-
ment with the end sought by Williams
and Amherst; we disagree only In the
means they unfortunately chose.

We attempted to show that we sin-
cerely are interested in ending discrim-
ination not in one chapter, but in 119
chapters comprising an international
order; and that our de-recognltion
would, on the one hand, considerably
strengthen the power of those chap-
ters that willfully discriminate by re-
moving a strong, militant, and recog-
nized voice of liberality from the scene
of international debate, while on the
other hand an organization whose prin-
ciples on this matter are identical with
the avowed motives of Student Govern-
ment, but of a wider scope, would be
denied life. Evidently you decided not
to publish this. Nonetheless, we feel It
is a factual statement deserving of a
hearing.

And finally, gentlemen, you chose to
publish some few conclusions of ours
without adding the evidence we offered
to verify our judgement. In doing so we
feel that you revealed a prejudice that
is irreconcilable with the responsibility
a part of being the sole distributing
agent for information concerned with
student affairs. This was unfortunate,
and admittedly it weakened our stand

Supports fraternity

Discrimination (in its broad sense) is
a valid and essential personal and so-
cial operation. Social discriminations on
the basis of ethnic characteristics
(“racism”) presents a real alternative
to discrimination on other bases, al-
though, in the opinion of most of us
in this university, racism is an irra-
tional and undesirable alternative. His-
tory should have made it obvious, how-
ever, that such emotionally charged
"ideas” as racism cannot be bludgeoned
or legislated out of existence: on the
contrary, they thrive on martyrdom,
real or imagined.

The best possible strategy I can
think of (on the basis of considera-
tions which lack of space prohibits out-
lining) for eliminating racism in frater-
nities and similar groups Is the very
one the Illinois Beta chapter of Phil
Delta Theta is applying: activity of
non-raclsts from within with a view
to making formal racist practices mere
formalities that will eventually "wither
away." In my opinion one pioneering
chapter like UC’s Phi Delta Theta can
do much more to eliminate racism than
half-a-dozen Michigan Plan schools.
"Liberals” who In their infexlble (“lib-
eral) bigotry Insist on immediate—and
by this I mean within the next few
years — and rigid application of the
Michigan Plan — particularly In the
case of Phi Delta Theta — are operating
against their own alleged ends.

After two years of listening to debate
on the Michigan Plan, after thinking
long about it, and after seeing It in
action, I have come to the conclusion
it is wrong. lam opposed to the Michi-
gan Plan; and yet I am no more a
racist (or a Fascist—or a fool) than the
most truly liberal of your “liberals.”

The Illinois Beta chapter of Phi Delta
Theta has stuck firmly to its concep-
tion of the honorable course: it has
refused to yield to extreme pressure to-
wards conformity to the standards of
the (University) community. This fra-
ternity’s independent stand Is in the
best tradition of the University of Chi-
cago; the undiscriminating position of
those ‘liberals” who insist on doctrin-

before those who depend upon
MAROON alone for reportage of
matter. If you and your readers
consider the summary enumerated
low, we hope that your opinions

the

will

Illinois Beta, the University of Chicago chapter of Phi Delta Theta, supports those who
desire and end to discriminatory membership practices by fraternities. The chapter began
its efforts toward that goal in 1946, and has consistently and enthusiastically worked to
bring about the changes necessary within its national constitution. It has been gratified to
see the interest which the campus has begun to show in its problem, but respectfully re-
minds those who have joined in the action that for several years Illinois Beta worked alone

and unencouraged.

The chapter believes that
the only effective way to bring
about change within its fraternity
family is to remain friendly and
work within the constitutional
framework of the group. It is con-
vinced of the superiority of its
position, but does not believe that
this superiority will be demon-
strated to anyone by violent or
abusive actions. The chapter has
been one of the leaders seeking
this change within its national
fraternity, and has been encour-
aged by the progress which has
been made.

The campus chapter regards as
an anomaly tne position that dis-
crimination must end this minute,
or this week, or this year — and
that “Liberalism” must be accept-
ed or else. It believes that discrim-
ination will be ended by being
discredited, but not by being
forced from one form to another.

The University of Chicago is
unique among American schools.
Its justified reputation for intel-
lectual leadership has made it a
minority organization. Those who
have misunderstood the Univer-
sity have done so largely because
they have misunderstood the
proper functions of minorities. If
other schools can be called “Fin-
ishing Schools,” then the Univer-
sity of Chicago is a “Beginning
School.” It considers evaluation
more important than conformity.

The Phi Delt chapter believes
that in this case students are be-
ing asked whether they them-
selves are going to demand con-
formity within the University
community. Significantly, P h i
Delta Theta, the minority in this
case, is actually representative of

The following occount of the
Phi Delta Theta chapter's position
with respect to their national fra-
ternity's selective membership
clause was written by Leslie Fost-

ternity, and of the MAROON staff.

1949 and 1950. The Michigan Plan
was passed in 1951, and only then
was a sustained effort made by
students outside of the fraternity
to alter its membership require-
ments.

The only other criticism before
that time came indirectly from
the university administration: it

was in the implications of the cur-
riculum. It was this last factor
that was probably the real begin-
ning of the movement against
such practices on the campus.

Illinois Beta still cannot bind
succeeding chapters, but it agrees
wholeheartedly with the position
that any future chapter which
fails to actively work for the elim-
ination of the clause will have
given up its right to recognition
by this university. It believes this
because it believes that the basic
justification for fraternities is the
benefits derived from the associa-
tion of its members, and that

(The following article represents in my view the senti-
ments of the majority of the Student Government.) ,
The Michigan Plan was adopted by Student Government
and accepted by the Administration in March, 1951. This law
was enacted under the provisions of the Statute of Powers,
the basic agreement between the Government, the Adminis-
tration, and the student body regarding the powers and scope

of Student Government.

The Statute granted to
Government, subject to
Dean’s veto, the power

the
the
to

grant or withdraw official Univer-
sity recognition to all student or-
ganizations. The Statute further
granted to the Government, sub-
ject to the Dean's veto, the power
to legislate amendments to the
Student Code and Regulations. In
this Code and Regulations are
contained the conditions with

majority opinion outside of
University campus, for it is
porting free discussion and

aire application of the generalized
Michigan Plan regardless of the appar-
ent good faith and anti-racism of the stitutional change within its
members of the local chapter of Phi
Delta Theta Is in the worst tradition of

our society.

The Illinois Beta chapter of Phi Delta
Theta deserves our thanks and support
for its couraegous and honorable stand.

Strozier gives

ternity. Illinois Beta feels that it
is not a question of allowing dis-
crimination to continue, but in-
stead a question of whether a
leader against national fraternity
discrimination should be sup-
pressed.

If one last division can be tol-
erated, then it will be seen in
what position the chapter regards
itself—. Illinois Beta is convinced

Mich plan view

“The Administration is willing
to say, at this time, that if Phi
Delta Theta does not revoke the
‘selectivity’ clause in its Constitu-
tion at its national convention
next September, Illinois Beta will
have to renounce the clause or

which a student organization must
comply in order to achieve official
University recognition.

Must remove clauses

The Michigan Plan provides
that all student organizations
must remove discriminatory mem-
bership requirements from their
constitutions in order to be recog-
nized after October 1953.

At the time the Michigan Plan
became law, three fraternities on
this campus had constitutions con-
taining discriminatory clauses. By
1953, two of these fraternities,
Zeta Beta Tau and Kappa Alpha
Psi, had removed their discrimina-
tory clauses. During the year
1952-53, Phi Delta Theta applied
for the one one-yer extension pro-
vided for in the Michigan Plan.
(Article II A 8 of the Code).
The Government granted this ex-
tension, hoping that by the final

leave campus.” Thus Robert M.
that its character and traditions strozier, dean of students, added
are the same as those of the Uni-

versity of Chicago. It believes
that in this matter its relationship
to the national fraternity is sim-
ilar to the relationship between
the University of Chicago and
other American universities, with
the exception that the chapter has
been more successful than the
University, because its problem is
considerably smaller. The chap-
ter has seen its minority position
within the national fraternity
gradually become a majority point
of view.

Despite the fact that almost the
entire membership of Illinois Beta
changes every few years, and that
no group can set up a policy
which would be binding on suc-
ceeding groups, the chapter has,
from 1946 to the present, consis-
tently and energetically worked to
bring about the change within its
constitution. There was no stu-
dent pressure on this issue until

the last page to the long history
of “Michigan” Plan negotiations.

Asked if the national fraternity
might not make a “gentleman’s
agreement” to pass the law at this
convention only to defeat it two
years later, Strozier answered
that we could not get into the
level of questioning the national
fraternity's good faith. “We must
begin somewhere,” he said.

“I can’t think of any course to
take if Student Government turns
down this proposal,” Strozier said.

The Dean of Students termed
the University’s stand with rela-
tion to the outside community a
“courageous” one. “Student Gov-
ernment will not be taking the re-
sponsibility for the plan. It is the
University that must. And we can-
not help thinking of it in terms
of the ends, the problems, and the
program of the University as a
whole.”

wise, to its problem.

or other-

was informed by the Dean of Stu-
dents that the administration was
reluctant to have the plan en-
forced as provided in the Code.
The Government desired to end
the operation of discriminatory
membership clauses on this cam-
pus by enforcing this section of
the Code, and at the same time
wished to make it possible for Phi
Delta Theta to exist within the
provisions of the Code. Conse-
quently, the Government under-
took a long series of negotiations
with the Administration and the
fraternity. These negotiations
have now gone on for ten weeks,
and have included more than fif-
teen meetings, including meetings
with members of the Administra-
tion, with representatives of the
fraternity, an open hearing at
which several campus organiza-
tions presented their views on the

Collectives ...

(from page 1)

large Kibbutzim that have about
1,600 people and often own small
factories and better recreation
facilities. The Kibbutz were start-
ed on a shoestring and a govern-
ment granted tract of desert by a
few hardy pioneers living in tents.
Today Israeli collectives are prof-
itable enterprises. Land is usually
made usable only by irrigation.
Difficulties on the Kibbutz are
found in the problem of just and
equal distribution of proceeds and
in disagreements between the
early settlers who prefer to plow
the profits back into the land in
the form of irrigation and the lat-
er immigrants who often prefer
to better the standard of living in
the form of apartments and bath-
tubs.

David Cummings’

on

Yugoslavia told about a collectiv-
ization failure. Between 1949 and
1951 the Tito government insti-
tuted a big collectivization
drive along Soviet lines which

resulted in about 25 per cent
of the land and the popula-
tion being organized into collec-
tives. The peasants however, were
used to the ways of arbitrary gov-
on the land, passively resisted the
attempts of the government to
force them into this form of life.
Since the Yugoslav government
did not try to use the brutal force
that instituted collectives in So-
viet Russia, the passive resistance
of the peasants resulted in a se-
vere drop in the yield of the har-
vest of 1952. This forced the gov-
ernment to declare an emergency
and to import grain from abroad,
mostly from the US to feed the
city population. In the following
spring the government suddenly
relaxed the program and permit-
ted the peasant to leave the collec-
tives if they so desired. Few of
them stayed. Today there are few
collectives left in Yugoslavia.
These successful collectives were
created not from peasant land,
but by internal colonization on
ernment and being self sufficient
former German holdings.

General conclusion of both Le-
vine and Cummings were, that
collectivisation programs are eco-
nomically ill conceived in parts
where the agricultural land is
already overpopulated, but can be
made to work in areas where free
land is available for the settle-
ment of factory scale farms.

these benefits spring primarily
from the differences between the
members.

Illinois Beta has been one of

UC soccer star shoved into Chevy,
hoods net wallet, trousers in ride

Another night attack on a UC student occurred January
14. John D. Godfrey, a geology student from England and a

the action against the member- -star of the UC varsity soccer team, was returning from a

ship clause in the national frater-
nity conventions following World
War II. In the three postwar con-
ventions, support has steadily
grown for the chapter’s position,
from only polite listening in 1948,
to a large majority in favor of
change in 1952. Illinois Beta sees
no reason why a change in the
clause cannot have full fraternity
support, since any individual chap-
ter would continue to decide who
it would accept for membership.

The Chicago chapter believes
that its objective of complete elim-
ination, or change to make the
clause in fact properly selective,
is close to being attained. Its plans
to bring about the change have
not been made public because the
chapter thinks that they cannot
be if they are to be effective. How-
ever, it has no objection to pre-
senting to the university proof of
1 its good faith, and continued,
1 energetic work.

Illinois Beta is not apologizing
' for its progress when it says that
it is not an organized lobby, and
its members are first of all stu-

campus activity at 10:45 p.m. At
54th and University a 1953 blue
and gray Chevrolet pulled up “to
ask directions,” and Godfrey was

That the fraternity publicly
renounce its discriminatory
clause, as the Amherst and
Williams chapters have done
in response to pressure
brought to bear upon them
by the Board of Trustees of
their respective colleges.

That Phi Delta Theta disaf-
filiate from the national or-
ganization, if their alumni or
the Administration would
make it financially possible
for them to remain here as a
’local fraternity.

The fraternity replied cate-

gorically that it would not re-

hoodlums a wallet, three dollars,
and a pair of trousers. Apparent-
ly not professionals, the thieves
let Godfrey retain his wateh, iden-
tification card, and the trousers
he was wearing.

nounce its discriminatory clause
and, even if its financial integrity
were guaranteed, that it was un-
willing to go local.

To rid the national constitution
of a discriminatory clause re-
quires a % vote of the member-
ship at two successive conven-
tions, which are held biennially.
At best the discriminatory clause
in the Phi Delta Theta constitu-
tio cannot be removed until the
Fall of 1956. In 1952, the forces
in Phi Delta Theta which are
working for the elimination of the
clause mustered their greatest
strength to date: 57 per cent of
the convention vote. Since ap-
proximately 30 per cent of the
chapters are from the South, and
more than 25 per cent of the total
convention vote is composed of
alumni clubs (which the frater-
nity admits are by and large
against the proposed change) it
is almost inconceivable that the
proponents of the change will
gain the % vote necessary to
carry through the preliminary
step in the striking of the clause
(which must be confirmed by the
same vote at the next following
convention). Failure in the 1954
convention means that the clause
stands intact until at least 1958.

We feel that the University of
Chicago cannot wait until that
date to abolish discriminatory
clauses on this campus.

Fraternity's attitude disturbing

The most disturbing element of
the discussion held by the Govern-
ment and the fraternity was the
fraternity’s attitude in this whole
matter. The fraternity refused
to repudiate its discriminatory
clause, and went as far as to in-
dicate that it might vote to expel
the Amherst and Williams chap-
ters of Phi Delta Theta during
the 1954 convention. The Amherst
and Williams chapters have pub-
licly repudiated the nationad dis-
criminatory clause.

The fraternity stated that it
was unwilling to repudiate its
clause because it had a prior
loyalty to its national organiza-
■ lion. It is clear that this loyalty
to the national organization over-
i rides the fraternity’s devotion to
; the traditional policies of the Uni-
versity.

Moreover, the fraternity wag
unwilling to divulge the vote in
the 1952 convention regarding the
elimination of the discriminatory
clause. Only through the efforts
of Dean Strozier, who contacted
the fraternity’s national head-
quarters, was the Government
able to secure this crucial infor-
mation.

SG willing to amend

We are willing, however, to
consider amending the law to ex-
tend recognition to Phi Delta The-
ta until October 1954, on the fol-
lowing condition: That by Octo-
| ber 15, 1954, the fraternity pub-
licly renounce the clause. Failing
this, the fraternity would auto-
matically lose its recognition. We
are willing to wait until October
1954, because the events of the
next national convention, to be
held in September 1954, may make
it easier for the local chapter to
take the required action.

The Dean’s position, announced
this Tuesday, is a big step for-
ward in translating the provisions
of the Michigan Plan into actual
policy. However, we are afraid
that it does not definitely close
the door to the continuation of dis-
criminatory practices through
1956.

We feel strongly that legally im-
posed discrimination on this cam-
pus can and should be ended in
1954. For this reason, the frater-
nity should not be recognized
after October 1954 if it is still
bound by a discriminatory me**-
bership clause.

Maroon trackmen

win Loyola meet

by Justin Johnson

Chicago’s varsity track team
rolled up a 72-2/3 to 31-1/3 victory
ever Loyola University in the
opening dual meet of the indoor
season last Saturday. The
Maroons won eight first places
and tied for another while slam-
ming the two-mile and both hur-
dle races.

Frank Loomis led the scoring
with first places in the 60-yard
dash, low hurdles and high jump,
asablishing a new meet record in
the low hurdle running. Justin
Johnson won the broad jump and
high hurdles, trailing Loomis by
a narrow margin to place second
in the lows.

Other winners for Chicago were
Captain Walt Deike in the two-
mile, George McCormick who tied
for first in the 440, Ken Stapley
in the 880 and Joe Howard in the
shot-put. Other UC scorers were
Hal Higdon, second in the mile;
Dave Shepard, second in the
broad jump and third in the 60-
yard dash and low hurdles; Roger
Forsyth, second in the shot-put
and Bob Mason and Dan Trifone
who placed in a three-way tie for
second in the high jump.

The relay team of Shepard, Mc-
Cormick, Phil Wyatt and Lowell
Hawkinson ran well but lost a
close decision as Loyola set a
new meet record.

JV beats Mt. Carmel

On Friday the JV track team
came from behind to defeat Mt.
Carmel High school 45-40 in a
dual meet at the Fieldhouse. Cap-
tain Jim Brown won the high
jump to tie the meet at 40-40 and

I IT ends victory streak,
defeat Maroons, 65-44

Joe Byerwalter and the engineers from Illinois Institute of Technology ended the Ma-
roons’ streak of three basketball victories Saturday night. The tall Tech center scored 29
points in a one-man show as IIT romped across the Field-House court to hand the Maroons
their worst defeat of the year, 65-44. w

During the first two quarters the teams were on even footing, only one point separating
them at the half, but in the final periods Chicago fell apart, scoring only 16 points while
Tech sank basket after basket.

Bob Mann, UC’s high scorer
with 14 points, and Dave
Smith did their best to hold back
the tide of goals, but Byerwalter
was too much for them.

SPORTS EVENTS THIS WEEK

then Dick Scupi, Mike Chernoff,
Bill Mitchell and Brown won the
final relay.

Brown also won the high hur-
dles and the 440, Chernoff the
pole vault and Chuck Youse took
the shot-put with a heave of 45
feet, 6% inches. Mitchell won the
low hurdles, placed second in the
highs and third in the 60-yard
dash.

Not even the assembled crowd,
brass-band and cheerleaders as
well as a planned victory party
afterwards could urge the Ma-
roons to victory. Although foul
shooting remained poor, Chicago
at last faced a team weaker in
this department. Tech missed 11
free-throws, the Maroons 9.

At present the Maroons’ record
stands at four wins, two losses.
Tomorrow night they face the
“old men” in the annual alumni
battle. Former lettermen will re-
turn and loosen their joints to
show the varsity how to play
basketball. This game will be the
Maroons’ last home contest for
several weeks.

With the full choir, a selected
male chorus, composed of men
from the choir will appear. It
will sing selections of Swedish
choral music which form the cul-
tural heritage of Adolphus col-

Both groups are conducted by
Eugene Casselman, a graduate of
Chicago’s American Conservatory
of Music. Casselman also gradu-
ated from Heidelberg College and

the Westminster Choir College.
Before taking up his duties at
Adolphus, he was voice teacher
and choral director at Colorado
College.

tone, great technical facility,
and true - tone pitch. Zoltan
Kodaly’s unaccompanied son-
ata for cello was a particularly
fortunate vehicle for the display
of these qualities, for the possi-
bilities of the instrument are ex-
plored to the utmost in the work,
even to the point of altering the
tuning of the strings. It is, to boot,
an exciting piece of music—mel-
odic without being trite, and in-
teresting without sounding con-
trived.

Miss Santoliquido chose to
make her impression with Bee-
thoven’s much maligned “Ap-
pasionata.” Her interpretation
was sloppy, bombastic, and in-
sensitive, and did not even have
sufficient drive- where sheer

momentum is required, such as
the coda of the finale. One shud-
ders to think what might have
happened to opus III, which
was originally scheduled.

The opening work was Brahm’s
E minor sonata for cello and pi-
ano, which was well performed
until Miss Santoliquido began to
run away with the tempo in the
last movement.

Several tidbits for the display
of the cellist’s technique, and a
Scarlatti sonata, all well done,
comprised the remainder of the
program. The reviewer did not
recognize the last encore, but
someone said it was the anthem
of the campfire girls, which
seemed not too unlikely.

UT casts ’Playboy of Western World';
schedules production for late February

Rehearsals for “The Playboy of the Western World,” University Theatre’s major produc-
tion for the Winter Quarter were begun this week. The Synge play will be presented in
Mandel Hall on the 19th, 20th, and 21st of February. The play’s cast, chosen from the
Theatre’s acting company,will include James Holland as Christy Mahon, the “Playboy,” and
Carol Horning as Pegeen Flaherty, the Mayo colleen who falls' for his dubious heroics.
Holland was last seen on the U.T. stage as “Azdak” in Brecht’s Caucasion Chalk Circle.

Carol Horning appeared in
Circle and also as the gover-
ness in Leonce and Lena of last
season.

Other members of the cast are:
Catherine Allison, Lois Karbel,
Sue Mehler, Lynn Alexander,
Leon Warterman, Barry Sherman,
Larry Zerkel, Joe Engel and Bill
Zavis. New Company members
appearing will be Mario Baur,
Jaques Dullin, Jeanne Cheatham,
Bill Tsokas, and Martin Leibo-
witz.

Synge is perhaps the best
known of the small group of

playwrights who, with W. B.
Yeats, joined to lend their
strength to the founding of the
Abbey Theatre, Dublin. Critics
have praised the Playboy as a
masterpiece by the artist who
produced Riders to the Sea, In
the Shadow of the Glen, and
Deirdre of the Sorrows. Synge,
Yeats, Sean O’Casey, and Lady
Gregory, with their reawakened
Irish nationalism, their insist-
ence on the values of folk-cul-
ture and the strong poetry of
the native Irish tongue, formed

Kracke ...

(from page 1)

the 13th Century a sharp check
was placed on government liberal-
ism, s h el v i n g Confucianism;
breaking the link with the tradi-
tion and teachings of the past and
producing a great void in popular
political thought, Kracke said.
This void could not be filled by
the Western brand of democracy,
which had an influx later, because
the idea of the people holding “po-
litical initiative” had no “emotion-
al appeal” for the Chinese.

The “communist illusion,”
Kracke felt, has supplied at least
two important elements compat-
ible with the latent teachings of
Confucius, offering some “emo-
tional attraction”—the nationali-
zation of farm lands and a de-
spotic government, feigning
fatherly devotion.

Strong family loyalty and popu-
lar criticism, on the other hand,
are being suppressed, and accord-
ing to Kracke the security of
China’s present government may
be shaken “if lip service to these
latter is not sufficient’*

and analyze them for low nicotine

A group of Chesterfield smokers have been ex-

amined by a doctor every two months for almost
two years. 45% of them — on the average — have
been smoking Chesterfield for well over 10 years.
The doctor’s examinations show ...

no adverse effects to
the nose, throat and
sinuses from smoking
Chesterfield.

Consider Chesterfield’s rec-
ord with these smokers —
with millions of other
smokers throughout Amer-
ica. Change to Chesterfield

and enjoy the taste and mildness you want —
highest in quality—low in nicotine—best for you!
