Face social ills'

says Egypt leader

Madame Ahmed Hussein, one of Egypt’s outstanding fem-
inist leaders and wife of the Egyptian ambassador, opened
this year’s alumni activities with a discussion of “Women in
the Moslem World.” Madame Hussein spoke on Wednesday
night in Mandel Hall under the auspices of the Gertrude Dud-

ley Foundation.

“The underlying problems
which women in the Moslem
world must face are not the
demands of their religion nor the
restrictions on their sex,” Madame
Hussein emphasized, “but the gen-
eral social and economic ills which
have resulted from the feudal
colonial status of their nations.”

The gradual freeing of women
ooes not represent the influence
of the West, but is rather a re-
turn to the original ideals and
practices of Islam. “The coming
of Islam,” Madame Hussein ex-
plained, “raised women from mere
possessions, to be bought, sold,
and inherited, to legal individuals
with property rights.”

"In the Moslem religion, it is
a duty to seek knowledge and
acquire education. Only contact
with Byzantium led to the isola-

tion and veiling of women, who
up to that time had been found in
all positions of leadership.”

The feminist movement has
been in existence for a century
as a part of the revolt against
western domination. The first
public demonstration in which
women took part occurred in 1919,
before the unveiling, in the face
of British guns. Since the partial
liberation of Egypt in 1922, the
enrollment of girls in government
schools has increased 14-fold. The
first girls were admitted to the
university in 1929; today there are
5.000. Women are participating

AEC Oppenheimer ruling

The recent developments in the case of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, in which the noted
physicist was found a “loyal citizen’’ but still a security risk, have been criticized by some
prominent UC scientists.

Samuel K. Allison, director of the Institute for Nuclear Studies and professor of physics,
said that the findings of the Atomic Engery Commission Security Board did not seem inter-
nally consistent.

The organization of Atomic
Scientists of Chicago com-
mented through its informa-
tion committee that the recent
AEC announcement "is an unfor-
tunate development in a disturb-
ing and frightening sequence of
events.”

The AEC board had stated in a
2-to-l decision that Oppenheimer
had contributed to delaying a con-
certed start on hydrogen bomb de-
velopment. The third member of
the board, Ward J. Evans,-profes-
sor of chemistry at Loyola Uni-
ersity in Chicago sharply dis-
ented, saying, “he (Oppenheim-
^r) did not hinder development
of the H-bomb and there is abso-
lutely nothing to show that he
did.”

Allison’s full statement which
was issued on Wednesday fol-
lows: •

“I was surprised at the finding



McCarthy victim cleared

)

Perjury charges against Vai R. Lorwin, assistant professor of industrial relations, have been dropped by
the Department of Justice at the request of Warren Olney, assistant attorney general in charge of the crim*
inal division.

Olney asked Federal Judge Edward M. Curran to dismiss the charges on the basis that they were irregu-
larly obtained. Previously, the Department of Justice claimed that Lorwin had lied to a State department
loyalty board when he denied having been a member of the Communist party.

At the same time William A.----------------------------------------------------------------•--------------------•

Gallagher, who was responsi-
ble for obtaining the indict-
ment against L o r vz i n from a
grand jury, was removed from his
post as trial attorney in the De-
partment of Justice.

Judge Curran dismissed the
charge after Olney stated that it
would not be "fair” to prosecute
Lorwin on a charge obtained ir-
regularly.

Former roommate testified

The case against Lorwin seems

in all aspects of society, with
equal pay for equal work.

“A general change in attitude
has been effected,” Madame Hus-
sein said. “The campaign for vot-
ing rights is succeeding: the prin-
ciple has been granted by the com-
mittee working on a new constitu-
tion, although the privilege will
probably be extended only to edu-
cated women.”

Madame Hussein recounted the
work of a group of women, of
which she was one, who have ven-
tured into the rural communities
to help them meet their many
needs. In a village near Cairo, this
group established the first nurs-
ery school in the history of Egyp-
tian villages.

"Others pleaded for the same,”
Madame Hussein recalled. “The

project was officially recognized
by the government, to be imple-
mented elsewhere. The World
Health Organization too was im-
pressed. and offered aid; they
saw in it a way to wipe out epi-
demic disease in the villages.

"There are now 375 rural social
centers equipped with nursery
schools. One-third of the rural
population is being served.

"Thus women in the Moslem
world, as in any other world,”
Madame Hussein concluded,
"must grapple with the problems
which face the community as a
whole.”

of Dr. Oppenheimer’s loyalty
board, because I had expected
both confirmation of his loyalty
and recommendation for rein-
statement of his clearance. The
findings do not seem internally
consistent to me, for if he is loyal
and careful with secrets, why not
listen to his advice, which he
based on the broad knowledge of
the whole atomic energy program.
The Atomic Energy Commission
should, of course, hear more than
one consultant before coming to
important decisions.

“Oppenheimer has undoubtedly
been forceful and eloquent, argu-
ing for his ideas of what would be
done, but this should be the privi-
lege of every citizen. The findings
are certainly an extreme example
of ingratitude for service to the
nation.”

The Atomic Scientists of Chi-

to have been based mainly on
testimony by Harold W. Metz,
former research director of the
Republican National Committee
and now research director of the
Hoover Commission. Lorwin and
Metz had been friends at Cornell
University, and later they roomed
together in Washington when
they were government workers in
the 1930’s.

Metz stated that Lorwin held
Communist party meetings in
their Washington flat, and that
he showed Metz his Communist
party membership card.

Lorwin made denial

Lorwin denied this, stating that
on one occasion (in 1935) Metz
walked in on a meeting Lorwin
was having with a group of Social-
ists. Since Metz seemed to be sus-
picious. Lorwin kidded him by
flashing a red-colored Socialist
Party card. Lorwin indicated that
he soon forgot the incident.

University of Chicago, June 4, 1954

Many alumni even ts scheduled;
LF sing to highlight weeh

As the last half of the University’s annual 10-day reunion begins, a number of alumni
events are scheduled, including the 44th annual Interfraternity Sing, at 8:45, Saturday eve-
ning, in Hutchinson Court.

The I-F Sing, the big event of each year’s reunion, will begin at the individual fraternity
houses, with dinners served for their respective alumni. After varying amounts of song prac-

tice, the fraternities will begin
into Hutchinson Court. As in
the past, each group will be
evaluated quantity- and qual-
ity-wise (for the singing), and
the winners will be announced
near the end of the program.

After the singing, awards will
be made for scholarship, student
achievement, “C” Blankets, and

protest

cago said in part in their com-
ment:

“By initiating this hearing the
government has laid itself open
to two serious charges. First, it
has dragged out old and well-
known allegations at a time when
they can serve no other purposes
than those of political expediency.
Second, and more serious, it has
attempted to muffle a sincere and
legitimate opponent of certain of
its policies by casting doubt on
his patriotism and character. Such
a procedure is characteristic of
totalitarian governments, but
should not be used in a democ-
racy.

“... We cannot understand how
the majority have found Dr. Op-
penheimer both fish and fowl
simultaneously—how can he be
at once a loyal citizen and a secur-
ity risk.”

Lorwin spurns
payment offer

Vai Lorwin yesterday reject-
ed a proposed Congressional
move to pay the cost he in-
curred fighting the charges.
Senator Estes Kefauver (D.-
Tenn.) was prepared to intro-
duce a bill to pay the expense,
but declined at Lorwin’s re-
quest.

Lorwin was denounced by Senator
Joseph McCarthy as case number
54 in a list of 81 "disloyal” offi-
cials in the State department.

On October 16, 1950, disloyalty
charges were filed against Lor-
win, and in February, 1951, the
State Department loyalty-security
board suspended him.

Tillich tells relationship
of theology-psychoanalysis

by Poul A. Hoffman

Dr. Paul Johannes .Tillich in a lecture May 18 defined the relationship between psycho-
analysis and theology. The 67-year-old world famous Protestant theologian spoke in Breasted
Hall in a discussion sponsored by the Channing Club.

Dr. Tillich listed the main
contributions of psychoanaly-
sis to religion:

1.	It initiated the acceptance
of a movement outside theolo-
gy into theology.

2.	It initiated a discovery
of sin, which Dr. Tillich said,
was too often confused with
the act “sins.” Sin—he said
it is always singular—was de-
fined as “universal estrange-
ment.”

3.	It initiated a rediscovery
of the demonic structures
which determine conscious-
ness.

4.	It initiated a conquest of
moralism in religion. Tillich
said, “The fall into moralism
was a fall into estrangement.”

5.	It initiated a new way
of dealing with the history of
religion.

6.	It initiated a rediscovery
of confession and counselling.

7.	It raised interpretations
which systematic theology
could answer in religious sym-
bols.

Dr. Tillich said “psychoanalysis
belongs basically to the whole ex-
istentialist movement of the 20th
century and as a part of this
movement it must be understood
in its relationship to theoolgy.”

He continued, “Psychoanalysis
and existentialism have worked
together from the very beginning
and have influenced each other in
profound ways.”

Dr. Tillich then traced the his-
torical development of existential-
ist philosophy and its opposite,
the philosophy of consciousness.
The philosophy of consciousness in
theology originated with Aquinas
and became part of Protestant
theology through Calvin and Des-
cartes. He said the United States
was living in a “moralistic and
repressive type of Calvinism
which is the result of the complete !
victory of the philosophy of con-
sciousness.”

Pascal was the first existential-
ist and his philosophy can be
traced through Schopenhauer and
Hegel to Kirkegaard. But with
Freud, Dr. Tillich concluded,
/‘what was theological became
methodological or scientific.”

He then discussed three stages
of Christianity and compared
pared them with their psychologi-
cal natures:

1.	The good creation which
is the essential.

2.	The universal fall from
goodness which is existen-
tional.

3.	The possibility of salva-
tion which is theological.

Dr. Tillich then described the
two shortcomings of psychology
^nd existentialism. The first is

Freud’s “unclear ambiguous atti-
tude,” which could not distin-
guish between man’s essential and
existential nature.

The second is the Freudian be-
lief that the libido can never be
fulfilled. Through religion it can,
Dr. Tillich replied. “The analyist,”
he said, “can be a tool of salva-
tion, but he cannot bring salva-
tion.”

Concluding his lecture, Dr. Til-
lich said, “Psychoanalysts need
not know that they have given
these gifts to theology, but theo-
logians should know it.”

In his Sunday sermon May 16
at Rockefeller Chapel, Dr. Tillich
chose as his text Paul’s word to
the Phillipians, “Again, I will say,
Rejoice.” He commented that
“Christians are accused of de-
stroying the joy of life” and
quoted Nietzche’s reference about
Jesus, “His disciples should look
more redeemed.”

He next defined joy. Pleasure,
he said, is the opposite of pain,

but joy and pain can exist to-
gether. Joy and pleasure do not
exclude each other, but “joy is
more than pleasure.” “Blessed-
ness,” he said, "is the eternal ele-
ment in joy.”

Dr. Tillich then challenged those
who accuse Christianity of taking
joy from the Earthly life by pre-
paring for another life. He replied
that “Jesus will give his joy to
his disciples now,” in the earthly
life as well as the other life. "Eter-
nal fulfillment must be seen not
only as eternal which is present,
but also as eternal which is fu-
ture. But if it is not seen in the
present, it cannot be seen at all.”

In the intervening Monday, Dr.
Tillich, on the invitation of John
B. Thompson, Dean of Rockefeller
Chapel, addressed a faculty gath-
ering, speaking on “Myth and
Symbol in European Theology.”
That evening, under the sponsor-
ship of the Chapel Committee on
Religion and Art, he delivered an
extemporaneous address in Man-

ligion and Contemporary Visual
Art’’ was illustrated With slides.

The main point of this discus-
sion was Dr. Tillich’s assertion
that secular art in the last five
centuries is better than religious
art. The common stereotypes of
Jesus and the Virgin in Protestant
and Roman Catholic painting are
“kitch’’ (freely translated as “re-
volting”). Great art today, he
said, is secular.

Former UC Chancellor Robert
Maynard Hutchins became presi-
dent of the Fund for the Republic.
He resigned his post as associate
director of the Ford Foundation
to accept the position.

The Fund for the Republic is a
Ford Foundation subsidiary estab-
lished in 1953. Its declared’ aim is
support of “activities directed to-
ward the elimination of restric-
tions on freedom of thought, in-
quiry and expression in the United
States, and the development of
policies and procedures best
adopted to protect these rights.”

Announcement of the appoint-
ment was made by H. Rowan
Gaither, Jr., president of the foun-
dation. Hutchins succeeds Clifford
Case who resigned the post to run
for the Senate from New Jersey.

Hutchins became associate di-
rector of the Ford Foundation in

President and Chancellor of the
University.

The 1954 Cap & Gown, the University of Chicago
yearbook, is currently being run off the presses
in its final form and will be on sale soon.

The post publication price of Cap & Gown will
be $4.50 and may be bought from Cap & Gown’s
salesmen or from the Bookstore. Those wishing
to order the book now may pay the $4 pre-publica-
tion price and receive their copies by mail.

The slick-page 1954 Cap & Gown is divided into
five sections: The University, a 46-page capsule
tour in words and pictures of the various depart-
ments of the university; an up-to-the-minute Chi-
cago Today section; twenty pages of group pic-
tures of students living in university housing; a
106-page view of this year’s extracurricular high-
lights; and a section of photographs and credits
of UC graduates.

The page size of the new Cap & Gown is con-

siderably larger than that of last
year’s permitting greater flexibil-
ity in layout and the inclusion of
larger full-page photographs. The
type styles chosen are likewise
larger and bolder than last year's

styles.

Accompanying the photographic
review of the university depart-
ments are editorial surveys of
those departments written by de-
partment luminaries themselves.
Each faculty author was given
complete editorial freedom, and
the included articles differ in both
subject matter and treatment.

Among those articles included
are the dean of the College, Rob-
ert Streeter's review of recent
changes in the College curriculum
and of the redefinition and re-
location of the UC B.A., a descrip-
tion of the Biological Sciences di-
vision by Merle C. Coulter, assist-
ant dean of that division, and “The
Humanities.” an essay of A. S. P.

Arthur Kiendl, assistant dean of
the college of Dartmouth univer-
sity, has been appointed director
of the UC Housing System; Kiendl
will assume his UC post in Sep-
tember when the contract of Carl
M. Grip, present director, expires.

Kiendl, a Dartmouth graduate
who also holds a degree from Co-
lumbia university, is a navy vet-
eran. He is married, has two chil-
dren. The Kiendl family will take
up residence in September in the
Burton-Judson quarters currently
occupied by Grip and his family.

Grip explained that the house
director’s post is essentially a
half-time job, “something for a
Ph.D. student.” Grip, who will
finish his psychology thesis this
summer, has no definite plans for
the future. At present, however,
he is looking into openings in the
teaching profession.

Grip said, “It’s been a wonder-

ful job,” and went on to explain
that he was at the University at
a time when many important
changes were taking place.

Letters...

"Salt" biased

I would like to register a dissent
from Frank Ternenyi s criticism last
week of "Salt of the Earth,’’ which he
“restricted to those points dealing with
Me position and validity as a work of
art. I think that Ternenyi’s artistic
standards were melted down by his com-
passion over the censorship of the film.
In film and play censorship cases I have
noticed two frequent reactions which
impair artistic judgment. Men some-
times say of the best censored works:
“It was not a very good film (or play),
but of course it should not have been
censored.’’ And when a mediocre work
is censored for some political or puri-
tanical reason, men sometimes say
•imply, in reaction against the cen-
■orship: "What a marvelous work of
art has been suppressed.” Ternenyi
ooems to have said just that of "Salt of
the Earth."

Now in our university community
nearly everyone agrees that "Salt of
the Earth” ought not to be censored,
whether by the city, the head of the
projectionists’ union, or the American
Legion. But censorship, if it occurs,
should not make “Salt of the Earth”
immune from the suggestion that it is
Jess than perfect.

Artistically, a film should have in-
tegrity. "Salt of the Earth" does not al-
ways have it. The screen introduction
says that all the characters are fictional,
but the hero of the film is a non-fic-
tional character called "Mine, Mill, and
Smelter Workers Union,” which is
named, advertised, and apotheosized in
very much the same manner which a
big corporation uses to exalt itself in
similar public relations films. "Salt of
the Earth” Is in great part an advertise-
ment which seeks to create good will
and sympathy for the "sponsor.” If
“Salt of the Earth” were a work of art
with complete integrity, its producer
would have either announced that it
was an advertisement, or used a fic-
tional name such as "American Miners
Union” for the main character.

The photography was excellent. So
was the acting of the "non-professional”
east, presumably recruited in the New
Mexico area. The economy of sets and
scenery was refreshing. But the acting
and scenery were no better nor more
startling than in may excellent docu-
mentary films which you can rent from
the International Film Library, the Brit-
ish Information Service, or the Chicago
Public Library.

The development of the narrative was
in part juvenile and creaky. Workers,
who are all "good,” fight a company,
which is all “bad,” and win. At one
point, without notice, the company ob-
tains a "Taft-Hartley” injunction which
forbids union members from picketing.
A wife notices that the injunction does
not refer to wives of union members.
The wives quickly replace the men’s
picket line and march for months with-
out a breath of injunctional disturb-
ance. Is It likely that a company which
readily obtained such a “Taft-Hartley”
Injunction without notice would have
then been unable to have it amended
to include “wives of union members act-
ig in concert with union members?”
The film contains a good dozen of simi-

lar anachronisms which fidelity to truth
would easily have eliminated.

Certainly "Salt of the Earth” presents,
a civil liberties issue. It ought not to be
suppressed because of prejudices against
the beliefs of its director and producers.
Only the willingness or unwillingness
of customers to attend the theater
should be the determinant of when and
where it is shown. But if we let censor-
ship become the imprimatur of aesthetic
perfection, we become doubly the pris-
oners, of the censor.

Rosen shortsighted

As a pretty constant reader of the
MAROON I feel duty bound to reply to
what I consider are the unjustified ac-
cusations made by Stanley Rosen. From
his letter it appears that Mr. Rosen
nourishes a bitter grudge against the
MAROON and also possesses a degree of
shortsightedness. The "contradiction”
which Mr. Rosen notes between state-
ments in the report of the " scientific'
survey” (the term “scientific” is Mr.
Rosen's description, for the writer of
the report does not use it) and in the
editorial column Is not only trivial, it
is misapplied. For a more conscientious
reader might have noticed that the
former article was written by a non-
staff writer in his capacity as member
of an independent committee and the
latter was the personal expression of
the editor. Is diversity of opinion so
foreign to Mr. Rosen that when he
sees It in a newspaper—"a forum of
differing views”—he calls it contradic-
tion? One cannot consider a newspaper
as a single entity capable of self-con-
tradiction.

As to Mr. Rosen's second question,
the most likely answer is that opinions
concerning the cultural reviews were
not mentioned, because they were not
offered. I think that Mr. Rosen would
be exceedingly shortsighted if he In-
tended to imply that opinions about
cultural reviews were deliberately ig-
nored. Other criticisms were included,
why not these? It seems to me that
the survey, conducted by a disinter-
ested university department—a seminar
in communication—cannot be reproach-
ed with being biased.

To my mind Mr. Rosen's own com-
plaints on the cultural reviews "struck
a new low” in criticism of the MAROON.
His charges toward reviewers as “illiter-
ates” and "Insensitives” who “pollute”
your pages with their “juvenile Marx-
ism” is empty and unsubstantiated. I
think that a writer is justified in ex-
pressing his own view’s, and to label
these views as juvenile or insensitive
is not to understand and illuminate
their faults. I can only hope that it is
ot customary for humanities majors to
call names rather than to criticize con-
tent.

I believe that Mr. Rosen's suggestions
that the opinions of the reviewers are
designed to impress readers as discredit-
able to the university and that it is
the intention of the editor to "destroy”
or “degrade” the MAROON were con-
ceived In a state of extreme ire and
that in more thoughtful moments he
would not have uttered them. The very
least I can say is that Mr. Rosen’s
criticisms do not measure up to those
mentioned in the report.

University supports Lorwin

The recent vindication of Vai Lorwin (see page 1) is impor-
tant in two respects.

It is the first major judicial set-back for Senator McCarthy
in his indiscriminate “subversive” search. It makes us won-
der: if number 54 on McCarthy’s list of “Communists” in the
State Department is innocent, what about the other 80 of the
81 he named?

Most important, the case shows once again that the Uni-
versity of Chicago will not retreat from its traditions of
academic freedom. Vai Lorwin is innocent, but the important
fact is that the University stood by a member of its faculty
when he faced indictment, trial and a possible jail sentence.

The University stood by Lorwin just as it stood by those
students, employees and faculty members who defied the Jen-
ner Committee last year. For this action the University de-
serves our highest praise.

Segregation must end

I

In an historic decision this month the Supreme Court of the
United States abolished segregation in the public schools of
the nation. At this late date the public was too well accus-
tomed and too well prepared for educational integration to
call the decision courageous, but nevertheless, it is an impor-
tant advancement, a milestone in American education.

The Court recognized the far-reaching effects of the decision
and wisely realized that the school systems of over a dozen
states cannot be overhauled in an evening. Implementation of
the plan may take time, but there is little doubt a significant
step has been taken toward ending school segregation. The
temperateness with which the decision was received on the
part of many Southerners leads us to believe that cool heads
will prevail to effect equitable implementation.

Let us hope that the rash and irrational statements of the
Russells and the Talmadges will be forgotten and that all of
us — Northerners and Southerners, white and Negro — can
effect a successful program of equality in education — and
that the effect of this decision will soon be felt in the explosive
area of housing, jobs, and recreational facilities.

REVIEW OF

THE YEAR

1953-54 Year of Self-Appraisal;
School Takes Inventory of Self

College Changes Announced
Met by CooLHeadedness

In retrospect, the year 1953-1954 at the University of Chi-
cago was primarily a year of self-appraisal. While the wheels
of education continued to roll, none of the week-after-week
excitement of some new crisis permeated the academic atmos-
phere as it had the previous year. Instead, it seemed as if the
University was taking inventory of itself, readjusting to its
own new administration and mid-century atmosphere in
America.	-

This attitude manifested itself most in the new college pro-
grams. Uncertainty and anger had met the original threat

of changes in the degree re-
quirements. While some of
this attitude carried over into
this academic year, the new pro-
grams, when they were finally
announced in the spring, were
met from almost all quarters
with a cool-headed understanding
«—if not agreement—of their pur-
pose.

Understanding their content
was a different matter, however.
The new programs were certainly
more complicated than the old.
The College BA requires a maxi-
mum of 12 comprehensive exami-
nations, a year of tutorial studies
and a bachelor’s essay. The Hu-
manities BA requires seven or
eight comps, six to twelve courses
in the student’s major department
and three to nine elective courses.
The Biological Sciences and Physi-
cal Sciences Degree mix college
and divisional work throughout
their four-year programs. In Law
and Business three years of col-
lege work are climaxed by a year
in the graduate school before the
degree is awarded.

Personnel Changes

Highlight Year

Three new deans assumed their
posts within three weeks at the
opening of the winter quarter.
In the college, Robert E. Streeter
succeeded F. Champion Ward; in
the division of Social Sciences
Morton Grodzens followed Ralph
W. Tyler and in. the divinities
school and Federated Theological
Schools Seward Hiltner became
acting dean after Bernard Loomer
resigned amid much controversy.

At the start of the summer
quarter Laird Bell retired as
Chairman of the Board of Trust-
ees. Edward L. Ryerson was
named to the post.

College professors Henry Rago
and Fritz Caspari were dismissed
because a lack of vacancies for-
bade their promotion. University
rules require advancement or dis-
missal for assistant professors
after four years.

Faculty Doings
Make Headlines

The biggest news story of the
year concerning any University of
Chicago faculty member was the
indictment of Vai Lorwin. The as-
sistant professor of industrial re-
lations was indicted on a charge of
perjury before Senator McCar-
thy’s subcommittee. Lorwin, a
former State Department em-
ployee, was number 54 on Me-
Cathry’s list of “communists” in
the department. But the case was
finally dismissed last week after
it had been shown that the federal
prosecutor, subsequently dismis-
sed from his post, had given mis-
leading information to the grand
jury which indicted Lorwin on
the charge that he lied when he
denied Communist party member-
ship,

Joseph Lohman, lecturer in so-
ciology, returned from Korea
where he supervised the prisoner
exchange in the winter quarter to
become the Democratic candidate
ior Sheriff of Cook County. An-

other UC professor (on leave of
absence), Paul H. Douglas was re-
nominated by the voters as can-
didate for the Senate.

Walter Johnson, chairman of
the history department, returned
from his round-the-world tour
with Adlai Stevenson and said
that Asia was “troubled and try-

ing to reorganize itself
war and a century of
ism.”

Leo Strauss opened
green Lectures with a

after the
imperial-

the Wal-
four-part

discussion of Machiavelli. He said
he sympathized with the "old-
fashioned, simple-minded view of
Machiavelli as a teacher of evil.”

Jacques Maritain urged relig-
ious training for students in two
lectures on the aims of educa-
tion sponsored by the commit-
tee on social thought.

A former University professor,
Edward Teller, was credited as
the man responsible for the de-
velopment of the hydrogen bomb.
And three Physical Science pro-
fessors made the front pages
across the nation when they
rushed to the defense of J. Rob-

ert Oppenheimer, the atomic sci-
entist accused of disloyalty. The
three were Harold C. Urey, Sam-
uel K. Allison and Cyril S. Smith.

' Noted Visitors
Lecture Here

The largest lecture audience of
the year turned out to hear
former US Ambassador to India,
Chester Bowles, condemn the
Eisenhower policy in the far East.
“ITS policy in India lacks cour-
age and imagination,” he said and
accused the Republicans of first
drawing up a budget and then
building a foreign policy around
it. He warned that the important
decisions in the next 10 or 20 years
“will be made in the capitals of
the East.”

India and the differences be-
tween East and West was the sub-
ject of a summer discussion by
Savepalli Radhakrishnan, the
Vice-President of India. He said
that there are no essential differ-
ences between east and west.

American policy was the focus
of the Walgreen lectures delivered
by Gordon Clapp. The then chair-
man of the Tennessee Valley
Authority Board of Directors de-
fended the TVA plan and said that
controversy over the project
springs from the novelty of the
undertaking and the breadth of
its subject matter.”

Novelists accounted for a good
portion of UC lectures. Joyce
Cary, Sean O’Faolain and John
Dos Passos discussed aspects of
the novel. Death snatched poet
Dylan Thomas just a few days
before his scheduled reading of
poems in the fall quarter. The
young Welshman died of a brain
hemorrhage in New York.

Henry Schwartz, Russian ex-
pert of the New York Times,
Lewis Galantiere of Radio Free
Europe, and Carter Davidson of
the Chicago Council on Foreign
Relations jointed with UC’s Hans
J. Morgenthau and 14 other pro-
fessors and students in an all-day

For a few weeks in January and February it
looked as if there’d be a new dean every week.
First it was announced that Robert E. Streeter
(upper left) became Dean of the College when
F. Champion Ward (lower left) resigned to accept
a Ford Foundation post in India. The' following
week saw Seward Hiltner (upper center) become

acting Dean of the Federated Theological School
and divinity school when Bernard M. Loomer
(lower center) resigned amid much controversy.
Then Morton Grodzins (upper right) became Dean
of the Division of Social Sciences replacing Ralph
W. Tyler (lower right) who had resigned some
months before.

conference on Eastern Europe
during the fall quarter.

Science also figured prominent-
ly in University lectures. Nobel
Prize-winner Hans Krebs, psy-
chologist Eric Erickson and an-
thropologist Margaret Mead dis-
cussed their research in lectures
here.

Hans Keisen, professor at Naval
War College, George Shuster,
president of Hunter College,
Meyer Kestenbaum, president of
Hart, Schaffner and Marx, round-
ed out the Walgreen series for
the year.

Government Amends
Michigan Plan

The same a t ti t u d e of self-
appraisal was found in the Stu-
dent Government this year. After
the ISL won 29 of the 43 Assem-
bly seats and elected Clive Gray
president, the Government set
about a re-organization of its laws
and services. Most important
change was the unification of the
Book Exchange, Ticket Agency,
Mimeo Service and the newly cre-
ated Loan Service in a single Stu-
dent Service Center in the Rey-
nolds Club basement.

However, the main issue in Stu-
dent Government was the Michi-
gan Plan which requires campus
organizations to remove any dis-
criminatory clauses by October
of 1953. The administration was
reluctant, though, to enforce the
plan, and only after several
months of negotiations between
the Government’s committee on
recognized student organizations
and the administration was a solu-
tion reached. The plan drawn up
by Dean Strozier and Eli Stein,
the committee chairman allowed
the one.remaining group with a
discriminatory clause, Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, until next fall
to remove the clause.

Evidentally the Government ac-
tivity did not arouse campus en-
thusiasm for ISL, and the vote in

New Deans for Old

the NSA elections gave 13 of the
20 seats to SRP.

Wash Prom Top
Social Event

New ventures for Student Un-
ion included hi-fi concerts in the
Reynolds Club at noon and a
weekly publication, Forecast,
giving social news. But their big
event was the Wash Prom in Bart-
lett Gym. A weekend of activities
was climaxed by the Prom itself
where 341 couples danced to the
music of Woody Herman’s band
and watched Jan Porter’s corona-
tion as campus queen.

Shortly before the dance some
indignant Green House girls
doused two MAROON reporters
with water because they were
angered at a MAROON story ad-
vertising for dateless girls.

The MAROON made news in
other ways. A facetious want-ad
by a campus photographer
claimed blackmail photos were his
specialty—he received a request!

Spacewise, the biggest MA-
ROON story of the year was Man-
aging Editor Richard Ward’s trip
to the Soviet Union. The second
excursion of college editors be-
hind the iron curtain found Ward
traveling all over Russia.

Football, Victories
Top Sports Events

Rumors of football began
spreading early in autumn, and
when the smoke cleared, the ad-
ministration, the athletic depart-
ment and some students agreed
on a proposal. If 100 students
could be found to participate in
an intra mural football program,
intercollegiate play could be start-
ed the following year. However,
student support waned and in the
Spring the program collapsed.

A string of victories in basket-
ball and track surprised many
who thought Chicago’s sports
were dying. Other athletic events
proved less advantageous for
Maroon teams, but the standard

of play was above normal. The
JV track and basketball teams
each won the Private School
League crown.

Goofiness Takes
Its Proper Place

The silly and the goofy events
without which a college does not
seem a college were still part of
the University atmosphere. A B-J
employee made front page head-
lines by slugging three robbers
one night with a baseball bat he
carried for his own protection.

The Cap & Gown made history
of some sort with their advertis-
ing— a picture of the Chancellor
in his off moments labeled “What
happens when Cap & Gown hits
Chicago?” and a poster describing
Hortense Fandangle who enjoyed
the yearbook’s “Smutty approach
to campus life.” A tear-out coupon
marked “rippety-tear” which ap-
peared in the yearbook’s “Wash
Prom Phoenix” inspired a letter
writer named “Publius” to sug-
gest that the whole Cap & Gown
staff be shipped to Northwestern.

For an early morning diversion,
a B-J student named George Ath-
anson dragged afew of his friends
out on the Midway every morning
at 7 and led them through a period
of calisthenics.

Cultural Activities
Attract Spectators

Campus cultural life was high-
lighted by the three issue of Chi-
cago Review, each winning more
praise than the previous. UT gave
fewer performances this year
than previous, but audience reac-
tion was favorable.

Off-campus visitors included the
folk-singer and ban joist Pete
Seeger, who twice filled Mandel
Hall, and Paul Robeson who drew
a large audience despite protests
by the American Legion.

The outgrowth of the gymnas-
tics department, Acrotheatre,
gave its annual spring show, en-
titled “Acrodeo” this year, .>

Major Qovernment Problem
Michigan Plan Enforcement

by Clive Gray,
President, Student Government

1953-54 saw Student Government make record progress in

asserting its role as the representative organ of the student
body before the administration. At the same time SG gave
the students the best tangible evidence so far of its desire to

the Reynolds Club Student Serv-

$400 in debt, and the book ex-
change, where students set their
used texts on the shelves for
other students to buy, could
scarcely ever be found open. Pros-
pects pointed to a great jump in
business starting in the fall.

In another student service
project, SG organized groups of
out-of-town students to travel
home on group discount plans at
considerable savings to all par-
ticipants.

But at the year’s end SG be-
gan to sense a failure to sell
itself and its accomplishments
to the student body. For of the
committee chairmen and other
SG leaders who ran in the April
election for delegates to the Na-

at two concerts on campus during the year. Both times he drew

panied* himself on a five-string banjo. Other folk singers, including

in one of the diversions of dormitory life. The half-hour period of

was the headline after Wash prom. The campus queen was elected
by the student body and officially crowned at the Bartlett gym dance
by Dean of Students Robert M. Strozier. She is shown above dancing
with her date, Chris Smith.

The year began as the Inde-
pendent Students League swung
back into power with over two-
thirds of the seats in the Student
Assembly, ISL’s best majority
since 1950. At once the assembly
faced the problem of implement-
ing the Michigan plan, a provision
in the official Student Code
passed by SG in 1951, which set
a 1953 deadline for campus organ-
izations with discriminatory mem-
bership clauses in their constitu-
tions to remove them or lose Uni-
versity recognition.

The administration was making
clear that it would not allow SG
to enforce the code against the
one campus group with a "selec-
tive” clause in its (national) con-
stitution. The reason: this group,
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity
chapter, was already working
hard in the biennial conventions
of the fraternity to remove the
clause by a vote of all the chap-
ters and alumni groups.

Discuss Plans

With Administration

But SG and its supporters were
aghast at the length of time the
fraternity would require to re-
move the clause by a three-quar-
ters vote at two successive bien-
nial conventions, the necessary
procedure under their constitu-
tion. As a result, lengthy discus-
sions were held between officers
of the fraternity, SG leaders, ad-
ministration representatives, and
faculty members of the Student-
Communications Board.

Finally, with the advice of the
faculty members, SG and the
dean of students, Mr. Strozier,
decided to set a new deadline on
October 15, after the 1954 Phi
Delta Theta convention. The ad-
ministration promised to enforce
the Michigan plan by then if the
three-quarters vote had not been
obtained, and the Phil Delta Theta
chapter refused to repudiate its
selective clause unilaterally. SG
then voted 25-8-3 to amend the
Code in line with the agreement.

In the meantime, Dartmouth
College students voted to enforce
a Dartmouth Michigan plan by
1964; and the University of Michi-
gan had no Michigan plan at all.
The administration had vetoed, it.

Establish

Service Center

The SG Student Service Center
combined the student book ex-
change, ticket agency, and mime-
ograph service at one spot in the
Reynolds Club and offered an en-
tirely new short term loan service
(for $10 or less). The Center was
open five hours daily for the first
five weeks of the spring quarter,
and three hours daily until the
summer. It did a daily business
of $50 to $150, drawing just
enough on commissions to pay its
own way. Previously, the ticket
agency alone was losing $60 per
quarter, the mimeo service was

The SG student needs commit-
mittee continued the efforts of
the 1952-53 group to found a stu-
dent housing cooperative where
men or women students might
live at great savings over both
neighborhood and dormitory costs.
It collected and presented to a
committee of the Board of Trust-
ees a large pile of information on
successful co-ops at ten other uni-
versities and colleges. Impressed,
the trustees approved of the pro-
ject, but it later developed that
the Unievrsity had no funds to
lend SG for the purchase of a
house. Late in April SG lined up
a hotel nearby where the students
might rent an entire floor; but a
signature campaign failed to un-
cover sufficient interest on cam-
pus to launch the project next
fall.

SG Co-op Seeks
Smaller Building

SG continues to look for a
smaller building in which to get
the co-op on its feet, but finds
itself hampered by a Chicago ordi-
nance prohibiting the conversion
of one-family dwellings or apart-
ment houses into any kind of stu-
dent dormitory unless adequate
parking space off the street is
provided for one car to every five
residents.

An SG - faculty - Administration
committee again chose two Chi-
cago students to study with full
scholarships at the University of
Frankfurt (Germany) under the
SG Chicago-Frankfurt exchange
program. SG also prepared to re-
ceive Frankfurt’s two representa-
tives to UC during 1954-55. The
expansion of the exchange pro-
gram to India had to be postponed
until it would be possible to pro-
vide room and board for an Indian
student in a UC housing co-opera-
tive.

The Student - Faculty - Adminis-
tration Court, which represents
the judicial branch of Student
Government, plowed through an
unusually loaded docket and, in
various decisions, termed uncon-
stitutional a 1952-53 by-law, repri-
manded a campus group for vio-
lations of the Student Regula-
tions, and challenged the legality
of certain additions to the Code
and Regulations made unilater-
ally by Director of Student Activi-
ties Birenbaum. Difficulties were
developing toward the end of the
year between SG and Birenbaum,
who challenged the grounds on
which this decision was rendered.

As usual, the year was marked
by a lack of concord between the
rival political parties. The minor-
ity party (SRP) opposed most of
SG’s major policies, especially the
Michigan Plan settlement and the
establishment of the Student
Service Center; and because the
parties were unable to agree upon
candidates for the SFA Court, jus-
tices were chosen as late as six
weeks after vacancies occurred.

At the beginning of tl^ J,
year, University Theatre an» SU(^
nounced a new organizational pol- «on
icy designed to facilitate broader *)li(
participation in the Theatre’s ac-
tivities. Included in the organize- j
tion was an expansion of thc^g^
“workshop,” the informal sessions
in which the company gained ex-
perience by producing improvisa- (
tions and sections of plays. But
the substance of the new organ- ^oj

ence for the company.

Faced with the difficulties 6i an,|

AlLcampus Events, Parties
Spark Campus Social Life

by Bruce Larkin,
former President,
Student Union

The UC social scene has been sparked this year by a series
of all-campus events and the typically numerous small parties.
The student body seems to appreciate smaller, less formal,
and more spontaneous social activities than the organized stu-
dent organizations tend to put on. Though the tribulations
of the larger groups may be thought by some to indicate a
student distaste for socializing, many feel that this is not the
case. The students wish to socialize, and do socialize, but
choose and create their own activities.

Many feel that there is little “social pressure,” as that is
characterized at other colleges

and universities. It is felt that
no one group — neither, fra-
ternities, nor dorms, nor commu-
ters, nor Student Union — exer-
cises any “control” over the social
sphere of activities. The bulk of
the “social life” consists of small
fraternity parties, dorm parties,
and even more usually simple
gatherings of friends. Even
though this is the case it is yet
evident that there is greater pres-
sure for “successful” social events

After his first year in office, Ryer- than has existed for the past few

Son (above) made this statement:

T*am delighted with the situa-
ti> n as I have found it, especially
Rie program of building new en-
rollment in the college. I have
been’impressed with the activities
showing interest of new possibil-
ities in this enrollment. I think
tins is very important for the
future of the University. Another
important thing is the South East
Chicago Commission and its con-
cern 'with improvement in the
University area and the rebuild-
ing "if some parts of the neigh-
borhotod which need to be rehabil-
Stated. I think these are the two
most important factors showing
signs “of progress, and also the
< uestion of the general budget
whicH has been dealt with intelli-
g i’l? . '

years.

Though we recognize these'
facts, we can still look at the
principal events of the year as
memorable occasions for those

who

attended.

A “C”-dance was sponsored by
Student Union on the first Satur-
day of orientation week. Not only
entering students, but also a large
number of newly returned stu-
dents were on hand. At the tradi-
tional Chancellor’s Reception dur-
ing the first week of classes the
Chancellor, other members of the
administration, and their wives
were present to welcome students
to the University and formally
greet the returnees.

Inter-Fraternity Ball featured
the election of Miss Jamie Red-
mond as Queen of the Ball. Phil
Levant and his orchestra provided
dancing music at the Edgewater
Beach hotel. The ball was well at-
tended, and well received by the
ten participating fraternities.

Friday, the 13th of November
found the "Bad Luck Ball,” a
production of Burton-Judson and
Inter-Dormitory councils. Adver-
tising featured umbrellas (open!)
hung inside the B-J dining halls,
and “8-6alls” posted on campus
bulletin boards.

The size of the undergraduate
body—steadily declining since the
peak of 3,421 in 1946-47—has pro-
vided a distinct and severe limit
to the range in which the extra-
curriculum may operate. The bulk
of support for social activities
emanates from undergraduates.
Those in the divisions are pre-
occupied with study and are no
longer interested in many of the
“childish” activities of the college
students.* There are now only
about 1,100 students enrolled in
the college.

Social Organizations
Must Compete

Social organizations have found
it necessary to enter into gruel-
ing competition with each other
to secure necessary attendance.
A social program should not oper-
ate at a consistent deficit. There
is not sufficient rapport between
leaders of sponsoring organiza-
tions or members of the adminis-
tration who advance the cause of
the extra-curiculum and the mass
of students. There is a tendency
to thipk in terms of the immediate
post war period, or the times
when there was a great deal of
spontaneous interest in the organ-
ized, formal social aspects of the
extra-curriculum. It would be un-
wise and unfair to indict the ad-
ministration for this failing; most
of the burden for not routing this
misconception falls upon the band
of “student leaders.”

The fact that social organiza-
tions must enter into competition
is a symptom of the situation. Not
wrong in itself, it is instead indica-
tive of the fact that there exists
less potential response to organ-
ized social functions than the pro-
grams of the sponsoring organi-

dent bodies will be found true
when their time comes. But the
consensus, both among those who
desire this change and among
those who are repulsed by it, is
that the student body will take on
an attitude more friendly to social
activities and will reflect to a
greater degree a way of thinking
similar to that of the more usual
undergraduate school.

There has been a place for tne
extra-curriculum in most formu-
lations of educational policy prac-
ticed today. There has not al-
ways been a place for “social pres-
sure,” or for activities predicated
on that principle. This student
body must charge future student
bodies to examine the state of
their extra-curricula and decide
whether their emphase and oper-
ations are consistent with fruitful
education.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

June 4, 1954

Sports Have Good Year
Despite UC De-Emphasis

by Palmer Pinney,
Sports Reporter

This is the time of year when
athletes, coaches, and alumni are
able to look back over a full year
of athletic activity and ask them-
selves, “How did we do?”

Even without the usual qualifi-
cations concerning player inex-
perience and the academic load
which discourages extensive prac-
tice, the answer is that we did well
this year. From cross country to
baseball, our teams gained more
than good exercise and good
sportsmanship; they also had the
satisfaction of winning. Not that
our athletic staff subscribes to
the theory of the Western Con-
ference coach who said, “Winning
isn't the most important thing . . .
it’s the only thing.” But no one
likes to become a virtuoso loser.

According to the above, cross-
country must have been the most
satisfactory sport of the year. The
skinny crew that tramples the
grass and disturbs the autumn air
in Washington Park went unde-
feated in 8 meets. Team captain
and iron-man Hal Higdon was the
individual hero of the season.

He was defeated only once, by
Owensby of Butler. Husky Jim
Flynn finished close behind Hig-
don in the majority of meets, fol-
lowed by a raft of promising
freshmen, including Paul Baptist,
Art Omohundro, and Ray San-
ders. These runners, plus Lawton
Lamb, Walt Deike, and Arnie
Meardon, won the Central AAU
Cross Country title for the UC
Track Club.

Meanwhile, the soccer team
managed to squeeze out a 4-3 over-
time win over Indiana in th? last
game of the season, thereby tying
with that team for third place in
the Midwest Conference. How
rough a sport soccer is may be
judged from what happened to
fullback Pete Rosen earlier in the
season, after he had headed the
ball the wrong way past his own
goalie, Gerry Czamanske, to give
Wheaton a 1-0 victory.

That night Rosen was set upon
by thugs; the last words he re-
members hearing before losing
consciousness being: “Czamanske
sent us.” Both Rosen and Czaman-
ske were subsequently chosen to
the all-conference team, possibly
for their fighting spirits.

Basketball, Track Top
Winter Sports

Winter quarter sports were
highlighted by the improved
showing in basketball and the
nearly perfect record in track.
The varsity quintet changed the
previous season’s 1-16 record into
an 8-8 mark. Centers Wally Loner-
gan and Fred Hubbard, and for-
wards Bob Mann and Dave Smith
paced the varsity attack.

The JVers won their second
straight Private School League
crown, but lost to Harvard in the
final game ' of the post-season
playoffs. The three players that
formed the nucleus of the JV
team were center Dewey Jones,
forward Mitch Watkins, and
guard Lynn Small.

In track, one of the strongest
aggregations of runners, jumpers,
and weightmen in recent years
was able to overpower every team
on its schedule except Marquette.
Sophomore hurdler Frank Loo-
mos, by great improvement, out
of Austin high school, skimmed
over the 70 yard low hurdles in
;07.9 to break Vern Gras’ old
varsity record. National six-kilom-
eter champion Walt Deike also
set a new varsity record when

Frank Loomos . . .

was perhaps the star athlete of
the year. Almost unbeatable in
the low hurdles, the young track-
man also won regularly in the
dashes and competed in the highs.

he shaved nearly 20 seconds off
the old standard by running a
9:19.6 two-mile.

The mile relay team of Dave
Shepherd, Lowell Hawkinson,
Ken Stapley, and the late George
McCormick came close to, but
did not lower, the record in their
event. All four of these runners
failed to compete in much of the
outdoor season. Nevertheless
team depth and versatility gained
victory in all but one of the out-
door meets. Justin Johnson and
Dan Trifone were particularly
consistent point scorers during
the season.

While the varsity was losing
runners during the outdoor sea-

services of the former three-man
nucleus of the JV basketball
team. These three, together with
Jim Brown and Dick Scupi, were
key in winning a triangular meet
with state champ La Grange and
city champion Wendell Phillips
high schools, as well as the PSL
track championship. Lynn Small*
scored two points for the team in
the state meet by taking 4th in the
220 yd. dash.

In those winter quarter sports
which do not extend into the out-
door season, Chicago teams fared
about as well as in previous years.
The fencing season reached its
climax when the national col-
legiate meet was held here, in
Bartlett gymnasium. JV fencer
Mike Fain won the state foil
championship to lead his team
through the season. Varsity swim-
mers had an average season, as
did the gymnasts, in spite of some
excellent performing by Herb
Taylor.

The Spring quarter saw a fairly
typical baseball teari develop. In-
fielder Bob Mann provided power,
polling two homers during the
season. Buzz Tarr turned in some
fine pitching, and firstbaseman
Dave Utley and shortstop Wendell
Marumoto did some excellent
fielding. Catcher Walt Walker had
more than his share of difficulty,
getting beaned one day and in-
jured on the hand the next.

After participating in fall ten-
nis (and compiling a 5-0 record
doing it) the netsters bogged
down to a 5-5 record in the spring.
Bob Fox held the number one
singles post, and teamed with
Myron Howland to form the first
doubles team.

their work continuously to a criti-
cal audience, they will show that
their unusual forms can be orig-
inal, creative, and meaningful.

The year before last a similar
idea to UT’s “Group” policy was

instituted in the medium of mu-
sic. The University of Chicago
Musical Society gave bi-weekly
chamber recitals by student in-
strumentalists followed by infor-
mal gatherings with the audiences
during which the performances
were discussed. This year, partly
due to a lack of physical facilities,
only one recital was given. Even
this one concert was a practical
success. A student composer had
a work performed and discussed
and instrumentalists had the op-
portunity to perform in small en-
sembles before an appreciative
audience. s

One of the most dynamic (and
perhaps most neglected) musical
organizations during the past
year has been the UC Glee Club.
Although it has presented few
full concerts, it has delivered
many informal recitals. In com-
bination with the UCMS it could
provide the medium for increased
activity by the musicians among
the students. As in the past, per-
fection of performance is not im-
mediately necessary but will come
only with frequent recitals before
an interested audience.

The Student Union All-Campus
Art Exhibit this year was con-
siderably smaller than in the
past. Insufficient preparation was
made both proceeding and during
the exhibit. Too few student ar-
tists were aware of their opportu-
nity. Yet, because the exhibit was
the only outlet during the entire
year for student work in the
graphic arts, it is doubtful that it
could have presented either quan-
tity or quality.

In the literary field this year
the student has had a similar lack
of opportunity. The three issues
of the Chicago Review, although
certainly more comprehensive
than in previous years, have con-
tained a very small proportion of
the student writing done on this
campus and submitted to the
Review. Admittedly most of the
work submitted this year has been
of too low a quality to print in the
magazine; but it will remain so
while the writers have no oppor-
tunity to present and discuss their
work.

Precisely the same type of
workshop that exists in UT is

Works unacceptable for publica-
tion in the Review may be printed
in a low cost format such as
pianographing or even mimeo-
graphing. Only in this way will
potential student writers have
their work read and discussed.

The other student cultural or-
ganizations maintained their
usual output throughout the year.
The University Choir presented
performances of Handel’s Mes-
siah, Bach’s St John Passion and
Mass in B Minor, and a group of
shorter works. The Documentary
Film Group presented three se-
ries of high quality films but a
decline in film interest during the
year left the group financially un-
certain. The Folk-Lore Society, a
revival of the defunct Folk Union,
presented a number of successful
hootenannies and appeared in con-
cert with Pete Seeger. The India
Association presented a concert
by Bala Krishna and a dance re-
cital by Vashi and Veena.

The Renaissance Society’s most
notable exhibit was of rarely seen
contemporary German drawings
and prints, including artists such
as Grosz and Kandinsky.

The professional events fell at
the extremes of unusualness and
mediocrity. Mediocre were most
of the overwhelmingly pedantic
University Concerts, relieved only
by the New York and Vegh string
quartets. Unusual were the per-
formance, (though not too well
done) of Everyman by the Chi-
cago Equity Theatre; the dra-
matic reading of Salt of the Earth
by Academy Award winner, Ann
Revere; the concert reading of
Susan Glaspell’s The Inheritors in
celebration of Academic Freedom
Week by members of the cast of
The World of Sholom Aleichem;
the performance of Ravel’s
L’Heure Espanol by the Interna-
tional Society for Contemporary
Music; the two tum-away con-
certs by Pete Seeger, one with
Bill Broonzy and the other with
Ella May Jenkins and the Folk-
Lore Society; and the first appear-
ance on campus since 1950 of Paul
Robeson — from which 500 were
turned away.
UC Choir does the Bach
'Mass in B Minor poorly

After nothing but records, one is grateful to hear the Bach B Minor Mass in almost any
live performance. However, the UC Choir’s concert May 23 had certain serious faults. The
main trouble seemed to be with ensemble; the cellos and basses continually rushed, and in
the arias the solo instruments were almost never with the singers, although it was hard to
tell whose fault this was. The strings in general were poor, especially the violin solo. The

winds were better, but the orchestra as a whole played everything, with few exceptions, as
loudly as possible, and with

little expression.

The soloists and chorus
were distinctly below the level
of their recent performance of
the “St John Passion.” The cho-
rus settled down and was much
more consistent toward the end;
the fast numbers in general
were good except that the early
ones were much too fast, and
the entrance of the “Qui tollis
peccata” was very beautiful.
The “Crucifixus” also was mov-
ing except for the cellos and
basses, but the pause before the
final chord, especially after the
surpassingly lovely progression
in the third to last measure,
was nothing short of idiotic.

The soloists, except for the so-
pranos, were all right except that
they never were with the orches-
tra, or the orchestra with them.

A great deal of these diffi-
culties seemed to be results of
tempi, which were often very

fast and always erratic; not be-
ing able to .see the conductor,
one can only conjecture as to
whether it was his or the or-
chestra’s fault. Neither, in any
case, can be much commended;
the winds might be excepted,
but the strings were continu-
ally out of tune and never to-
gether, and did not reflect very

Richard E. Vikitrom

favorably on the Chicago Sym-
phony, which is one of the con-
cert's main calling cards; on
the other hand, the tempi were
often wrong, and the interpre-
tation ridiculous, the most glar-
ing example, the end of the
“Crucifixus,” was already men-
tioned. Other than this, in the
“Confietor” one would have
liked some slight change in dy-
namics, at the beginning of the
“Et expecto.” Of course there
was little enough dynamic
change throughout, and the
tempi not merely wrong but
often erratic and unsteady.

To sum up: first of all, the fact
that the strings are Chicago Sym-
phony members is hardly good
enough advertising to warrant in-
competence. Second, rehearsals of
the orchestra alone and the or-
chestra with individual soloists
would help immeasurably. Third,
Bach is not the place for impres-
sionistic effects, and benefits
most by a careful, steady reading,
allowing the music to speak for
itself. Fourth, it might be men-
tioned that, however charming
the atmosphere, Rockefeller
Chapel is no place to hear music,
particularly music of some com-
plexity of texture.

Next year's concert series
features return of quartets

As announced for next year, the University concerts promise
to be one of the best series in recent years. The Autumn quar-
ter concerts begin with a program of Appleton and Field,
noted piano team, in a recital of Brahms, Stravinsky, Bartok,
Tailleferre and Ravel; this will be followed on Nov. 5 by a
recital of Grant Johannesen, pianist, playing Mozart, Beetho-

ven, Schumann, Faure and
Ravel.

The remainder of the quar-
ter series includes a sonata recital
by Alexander Schneider, violin
and Artur Balsam, piano, present-
ing sonatas by Schumann, Her-
bert Fromm and Ben Weber, and
the Grand Duo of Schubert; and
a program by Grace Creswell, con-
tralto, of ballads, songs and
“white spirituals.’’

The Winter quarter features
three string quartets and a cham-
ber group in a series of varied pro-

grams; including the New Music
Quartet, playing quartets by
Schumann, Kirchner and Beetho-
ven; the Budapest Quartet pre-
senting works by Benjamin Lees,
Beethoven’s Op. 130 (with the
rondo finale) and William Denny;
the University Chamber Music
Players, in a program of oboe
quartets by William Shield, Moz-
art and Britten; and the Vegh
String Quartet, playing Beetho-
ven’s Op. 135, Bartok No. 6 and
Mozart, K. 575.

The Spring Quarter opens
with the New York Quartet, play-
ing Brahms’ Piano Quartet in A»
remainder of the program to be
announced. Also featured are
Phyllis Curtin, and the Shuman
Brass Choir.

Subscription tickets are on sale
at the rate of $10 for the entire
season. Quarterly subscriptions
are $4.40 for the Autumn and
Winter series, $3.30 for the
Spring. Single tickets at $1.50 will

seventh annual 57th Street Art
Fair, to be held on the north side
of 57th Street between Kenwood
and Kimbark.

A nominal entry fee, and a seri-

requirements, the fair has proved
to be a forum for a wide range of
artists. It has also proved popular
with Chicago residents since all
works displayed are on sale at
reasonable prices.

The works are in a wide range
of media; oils, watercolors, etch-

'Salt of the Earth' has
difficulties at opening

Salt of the Earth, scheduled to open at the Cinema Annex
last Friday did not open. A capacity audience filled the theatre
only to find out that the Motion Picture Operators Union
would not allow the projectionist to show the film.

The audience heard addresses by Herbert Biberman, direc-
tor of the film, and Juan Chacon, male lead in the film, and

president of local 890, Inter-
national Union of Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers, who
had come in from New Mexico to
attend the Chicago opening.

Biberman asked that letters be
sent to the newspapers and to
the operators’ union, protesting
the action.

The operator, a five-year em-
ployee of the Cinema Annex, had

Juan Chacon

Lorwin . .

(from page 1)

lagher left the Department of
Justice.

Gallagher claims that he was
not fired, but resigned because
his superiors directed him to dis-
obey a federal court order. How-
ever, Attorney General Herbert
Brownell stated that “he (Gallag-
her) has been discharged for his
irregularities.”

Irregularities charged

These irregularities were listed
as:

| that Gallagher had told the
■ ■ grand jury that the Govern-
ment had two witnesses from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
who would support the grand jury
testimony of the single witness
(Metz) who had testified against
Lorwin; and that

H that Gallagher had told the
"■ grand jury that it was not
necessary to call Lorwin or his
wife because they would claim
the fifth amendment (against self
incrimination) and refuse to
testify.

1132 E. 55th Street

been called out of the theatre by
Clarence Jalas, business manager
of the Moving Picture Operators
Union, Local 110. No replacement
was sent.

The film is currently being
shown with union operators in
Los Angeles and San Francisco,
and has just finished a two and a
half month run in two New York
City theatres. Reviewing its open-
ing in Mexico City, one of the
city’s newspapers called it the
“most important film to have been
made in North America.”

Since the scheduled opening
over six thousand people have
been turned away from the Cin-
ema Annex. More than 650 phone
calls inquiring about the film have
been received by the theatre.

Referring to the actions of Jalas
and Edward Clamage of the
American Legion, Biberman said:

“These men, without regard for
the rights of freedom of speech
communication, and assembly of
the people of Chicago, are not act-
ing for themselves alone. They
are continuing the two and a half
year old attempt of similar ele-
ments in the motion picture indus-
try, who fear the competition of
such popular, realistic films as
Salt of the Earth, to prevent this
film from reaching the American
public. These Hollywood monop-
olizers of thought have spurred
on many others to action destruc-
tive of every right of the artist
and the public audience under our
laws and traditions of individual '
liberty.”

In fact, the government never
produced the two FBI witnesses;
and the records of the loyalty
board showed that Lorwin and his
wife testified at length, vigorously
denying any Communist affilia-
tion.

Falsehoods cited

When informed that the charg-
es against him were being drop-
ped, Lorwin stated: “In asking to-
day for a dismissal of the indict-
ment against me, the government
has admitted the obvious fact that
there could be no other case
against me than that based on
misrepresentation, falsehood, or
obstinate misunderstanding.

“The allegations of Communism
were particularly outrageous in
view of the long record of vigor-
ous anti-Communism in my work
and outside activities,” continued
Lorwin. “No responsible official
of the Department of Justice who
took the trouble to read that rec-
ord could have had the slightest •
doubt that the department was
prosecuting an innocent man.”

It's a hit. . .

an error, a couple of fumbles and
a bad throw—and so faculty third
baseman, Donald Meiklejohn gets
credited for a "home-run.” The
chairman of the social sciences 3
course is shown at the right as he
started the swing that netted him
a four-base blow.

Faculty softball team
loses in annual battle

was clear and the day warm,
a goodly crowd was assembled
and the faculty team was as ready
as ever they’d be.

A double by Hugh Lane, a sin-
gle by Meyer Isenberg and the
first of Mark Ashin’s two triples
scored two runs for the faculty.
But Mathews came back in the
last half of the first and turned a

walk and four singles off Ashin’s
fast ball into four runs.

Bill Birenbaum had a tough day
umpiring the game, but he came
through it all resolutely, calling
balls strikes and strikes balls, and
dusting the plate with a Chicago
daily.

Toward the end of the game-
after the fans and both teams
were on his neck—the director of
student activities remarked to fac-
ulty first-baseman Carl Grip, .,
“Don’t you ever invite me to do
this again.” Grip replied, “Unless
you call some more balls, I won’t.”

On a series of walks and errors
in the fourth and fifth innings
Mathews scored a total of seven
runs. Student-Faculty-Administra-
tion Court Justice Dan Feldman
gave his fellow justice Don Mei-
klejohn a tough time in left-field,
but Meiklejohn came through it
all right, pounding a somewhat
dubious home run in the fourth
and sending a long fly to Feldman
to score Ashin after his second
triple.

Neal Huffaker’s pitching and
Leon Rosenberg’s batting gave
Mathews a 12-6 lead at the end
of seven innings. Faculty captain
Ashin asked that the game be
played nine innings—instead of
the regulation seven to give the
professors a better chance. This
proposal was okayed by Mathews’
captain, George Striker.

The solid hitting of Bob Streeter
helped the old men slightly, but
they could not overcome the large
Mathews lead. The final score’'
gave the faculty 9, Mathews 12.
For the second straight year, the
Burton Judson camps defeated
the faculty.

JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED

1.	THE MIRACLE TIP.. ■ L&M’s exclusive filter tip
contains Alpha Cellulose ... for most effective filtra-
tion. Selects and removes the heavy particles, leaving
you a Light and Mild smoke.

2.	PUREST AND BEST filter made. Exclusive with L&M.
Result of 3 years of scientific research ... 3 years
rejecting other filters. This is it!

3.	MUCH MORE FLAVOR...MUCH LESS NICOTINE.
L&M Filters are the first filter cigarettes to taste the
way a cigarette should. The premium quality tobaccos
. . . and the miracle filter work together to give you
plenty pf good taste.

Drops Price!

Sire up to 4* a pack

Since L&M Filters were put on sale
across the country they have gained a
nation-wide demand never before
equalled by any other cigarette in so
short a time.

Already, thousands of big-city dealers
report — L&M their largest selling filter
cigarette!

Why have L&M Filters rolled up sales
