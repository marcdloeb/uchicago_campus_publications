Dean

by David Schlessinger

Loomer quits

Bernard M. Loomer, associate professor of the Federated Theological Faculty, has resigned his positions as Acting Dean of the
Federated Theological Faculty and Dean of the Divinity School. Loomer's resignation was effective as of last Monday. He remains
an associate professor but has been replaced as Acting Dean of the Faculty by Seward Hiltner. Hiltner is also an associate professor
of the Federated Theological Faculty. As yet, there has been no decision on the choice of a new dean of the Divinity School.

Loomer said, in substance, that the, reason for his resignation was his decision about three weeks ago that, as Dean, he could no

longer act in good faith and continue to act constructively. During his service since 1945 as Dean of the Divinity School, Loomer has

been active in a reorgani-
zation of the Theological
Faculty into seven instead
of four fields of specialization,
in the formulation of the Ar-
ticles of Federation of the The-
ological Faculty, and in the estab-
lishment of a community of social
and intellectual interest within
the members of the Faculty.

In an interview, Hiltner empha-

Court rules on SRP case
finds guilty, on probation

The sentence in the Student Government vs. the Student Representative Party case, as
announced by the Student-Faculty Administration Court on Jan. 28, is probation for SRP
through the end of the current quarter. No probationary conditions were imposed by the
court and none of the justices was available for comment at the time of the release.

In order to follow the intent of the regulations of the Student Code, the court decided
that the C-Shop is not a legal place for petitioning, but that the basement and the lounges

of the Reynolds Club are. “If
the ban on the circulation in
the C-Shop is wrong in policy,
it is up to the assembly, and not
for us, to change it,” reported the
court.

SRP was indicted by SG on De-
cember 8 on the following counts:
1) circulating book co-op pledges
in the C-Shop, the basement of the
Reynolds Club, and in front of the
Reynolds Club desk; 2) for circu-
lating book co-op pledges with-
out the name of the sponsoring
organization on the petitions; 3)
placing the “SRP Newsletter” in
the mail boxes of Beecher Hall,

and 4) circulating the “SRP News-
letter’’ in Hitchcock Hall without
the approval of the House Coun-
cil.

The court ruled that SRP was
technically guilty on all four
counts except for the inclusion
of the Reynolds Club basement in
the first count. The court report
read “Circulation of pledges in the
basement of the Reynolds Club
was not forbidden by the code and
this part of the indictment is in-
valid and dismissed.”

In connection with point two,
SRP maintains that the only omis-
sion was in neglecting to proof-
read the petitions. The name of
the sponsoring organization was
added to the petitions as soon as
the error was discovered. Accord-
ingly, the court judged that there
was no intent to conceal the
source of the document circulated.
Reading from the report, “Con-
cealment is the crux of the viola-
tion, and absence of such intent

Report on USSR
Scheduled for Thurs.

Next Thursday afternoon the
MAROON will sponsor a report on |
the USSR to be given by Richard E.
Ward. 7

The exact time and place of Hie
meeting, which will be open free to
all members of the University, will
be announced on posters early
next week.

Ward stated that he will answer
questions and will limit his talk to
provide • greater opportunity for
questioning.

sized that “Although my position
is an acting deanship, and an act-
ing dean must be cautious, I told
the faculty that I would not con-
sider taking the job unless I could
do what I felt had to be done.
After all, an Acting Dean who
cannot promote deserving facul-
ty members or make necessary
appointments is really an ‘acting’
dean who does not act.”

Hiltner emphasized his appoint-

is, in this instance, an important
factor in mitigation.”

The court stated that the regu-
lation covering the third count
was difficult to interpret because
of certain ambiguity. It construed
the purpose of the regulation to
prevent interference with the reg-
ular mail and concluded that the
defendant’s action did not do this
in effect. However, the court
maintained that SRP did not com-
ply with the remainder of the
regulation which provides that
material may be placed “only in
designated locations in each hall,”

* "Russian educators would have little sympathy for the educational theories of Robert Maynard Hutch-
ins/' said Richard E. Ward, MAROON managing editor, who this week returned to Chicago from a three
week tour of Russia.

"Russian students are encouraged to choose their occupations at an early age. They begin their engineer-
ing and medical studies as-----------------------

early as the age of 17. The
vast majority of students'at-
tend technical institutes (engi-
neering schools). During the lat-
ter years of their stay in college
considerable time is spent in on-
the-job training.”

From what Ward could observe
most higher education was aimed
at occupational training. Students
to whom Ward explained UC’s
Callege could not understand the
reason for a program that did not
prepare students for specific voca-
tion.

Left NY on Chrittmos

Ward left with a group of six
other college editors from New
York on December 25. They flew
to Helsinki via London and land-
ed in Moscow three days later.

After a five day visit in Mos- .

cow, the College editors began a *n the Great Palace of the Krem-
------------------------------ lin at a party sponsored by the

two week tour of western USSR.
Ward went first to lenigrad, then
to Minsk in Byellorussian SSR,
Kiev and Kharkov in the Ukraine,
and Tblisis (Tiflis) in Georgian
SSR.

The editors had split into two

groups after leaving Moscow. The

ment as only temporary. “I am
Acting Dean for only eight
months (until October 1); that is,
mine is an interim appointment,”
he said. “I hope,” he continued,
“that my permanent position un-
til retirement will be that of pro-
fessor.”

When asked about his general
plans, Hiltner replied that he
“plans to continue the basic pro-
grams which have been estab-

since they did not obtain direc-
tions from the house government.

SRP was ruled guilty on point
four and did not obtain mitigation
on the basis that they received
permission from Carl Grip, the
head of the Dormitory House Sys-
tem. On this the court states, “re-
gretably we must conclude that
these gentlemen, though no doubt
acting in good faith have not ac-
quainted themselves with the gov-
erning documents ... in no way
can we condone defendant organ-
ization’s failure to read and fol-
low the law.”

other group first went south to
Baku on the Caspian Sea. They
also visited Tblisi, Kharkov, Odes-
sa, and Kiev. The two groups met
in Moscow where they spent their
last two days in the USSR.

Visited many schools

Ward stated that during his
stay in the Soviet Union he visit-
ed three Uuniversities, three tech-
nical institutes, an art institute,
and a middle school. The latter,
Ward explained, is a ten-year
school which gives an approxi-
mate equivalent of. the American
primary and secondary education.

Other visits which Ward found
interesting, were to a Kolkhoz
(collective farm) in near Kharkov
and to several factories. The edi-
tors were invited to a New Year's
eve party at Moscow University.
They spent the following evening

Central Committee of the Komso-
mol (Young Commuist League)
and the Moscow trade unions.

Met Bohlen

While in Moscow the editors
were given a luncheon by Ambas-
sador and Mrs. Bohlen.

The group left Moscow on Jan-

lished."

Much appreciation was ex-
pressed by Hiltner for the “really
careful, sympathetic study of the
problem by Chancellor (Lawrence
A.) Kimpton. We can certainly
feel convinced,” he said, “that
Chancellor Kimpton is capably
looking out for the interests of
the school.”

Conflict rumored.

Loomer’s resignation brings in-
to relief campus-wide rumors of
tension between the Theological
Faculty on one hand, and Chan-
cellor Kimpton and sections of the

Midyear class
begins studies

The College will welcome about
50 students tomorrow for the be-
ginning of the midyear orienta-
tion program.

The students will be greeted by
Robert M. Strozier, dean of stu-
dents, John R Davey, dean of stu-
dents in the College, and Student
Orientation Board. The new stu-
dents will also begin their place-
ment tests tomorrow.

Davey said that the midyear
group usually differs from the
regular autumn entrant by hav-
ing a higher proportion of high
school graduates and other stu-
dents whose education has been
interrupted. About twenty per
cent of this year’s group are ex-
pected to be entered as first and
second year College students.

Special half - year accelerated
College courses will be offered to
the midyear entrants.

Clubs pick King

Bruce Collard is the new Inter-
Club King.

Collard won the title at the In-
ter-Club Ball last Saturday night.
The dance was held at the Hotel
Sherry.

The other entrants were Stan
Fox, sponsored by Sigma Delta,
Ted Richert (Sigma), Don Mc-
Vicker (Mortar Board), and Herb
Taylor. Collard was sponsored by
the Quadranglers.

uary 19 and flew to Berlin via
Warsaw. They flew from Berlin
to Frankfurt and travelled to
Paris by train. While talking to
some newsmen in Frankfurt
Ward became separated from the
rest of the group. He rejoined
the party the next day in Paris.

Ward stated that this tour by Union.

Boar dof Trustees on the other.
The real situation and true causes
for Loomer’s resignation remain,
however, unknown.

The position of Acting Dean
which has changed handes is only
a year old. It was created so that
the four affiliates of the Feder-
ated Theological Seminary could
have the advantage of “efficient,
centralized academic operation.”
Each of the four branches has re-
tained separate endowment and
jurisdiction.

One year added
U-High program

U-High, which at present ex-
tends through the tenth grade,
will add another year of study to
its program next fall, stated Har-
ald D. Dunkel, professor of edu-
cation. It has not yet been decided
whether the fourth year of high
school will also be added when
U-High has students who reach
that grade.

The Board of Pre - Collegiate
Education, which decided last
week to extend the high school
program, referred consideration
of the specific changes to be made
to a joint committee appointed by
the policy committees of the Col-
lege and the Laboratory School.
This committee will soon begin to
consider appropriate recommen-
dations.

According to Dunkel, director
of Pre-Collegiate Education on the
Board, many parents take their
children out of the Lab School
after the eighth grade. This
change, he declared, “will serve
the community, satisfying a wish
on the part of residents to have
a four-year school.” In addition,
the extension of U High is con-
nected with the recent change in
the College program.

Dunkel stated that this change
will make the University’s Lab-
oratory School program more use-
ful as a laboratory, when it more
closely resembles other schools.
“Resemblance is not identity.
When you get too far away from
other school, it becomes very dif-
ficult for them to learn from you.”

the college editors has been re-
ceived extensive newspaper cov-
erage. It is very difficult for a
short newspaper account to ac-
curately reflect what we have
said, he contined. Ward will begin

Propose amendment to Student code

An amendment to the student code was proposed by Eli Stein, chairman of the Committee
on Recognized Student Organizations, Tuesday night in the Sudent Government meeting.

New biopsychology course
opened in BiSci division

A new research section devoted to the field of biopsychology

has been organized under the department of psychology. A
study developed largely through experimentation on this
campus, it deals with the general problem of relationship
between the structure and function of the brain.

Programs have been set up for training in teaching and

extensive research leading to
a doctorate in biopsychology.
Emphasis is placed on founda-
tional training in the natural and
biological sciences, where stu-
dents will spend one-third of their
early graduate study in labora-
tory research. The entire program
will require three years, with the
remaining time spent in special-
ized instruction, reseach and ad-
vanced seminars.

The first year of graduate work
for biopsychology students begins
with courses in general psychol-
ogy, and a course in statistical
theory and techniques given by
the department of psychology. In
addition to a preliminary exami-
nation at the end of the first year,
these students must take a sec-
ond exam and submit a disserta-
tion proposal to be presented to
a seminar of staff and students.
When the dissertation has been
approved, research begun, and the
divisional requirements satisfied,
the students will become candi-
dates for the biopsychology de-
gree. Degrees are awarded after a

final oral exam.

The staff of the new section
includes: Professors Garth Thom-
as, Eckhard Hess, Howard Hunt,
William Neff, Austin Riesen,
Heinrich Kluver, and Ward C.
Halstead, chairman.

Halstead stated, “Biopsychology,
through its’teaching and research
programs, hopes to gain under-
standing of the oldest riddle in
biology, the basic relations be-
tween brain functions and the
human mind.”

Denies McCarthy charges

Cites the first amendment

The man who told Senator Joseph McCarthy that his poli-
tics are none of the senator’s business addressed a crowd of
200 people in Judd 126 Tuesday night, under the sponsorship
of the Student Representative Party. Harvey O’Connor, au-
thor and labor journalist, was joined on the platform by
Professor Malcolm Sharp and Frank Kirk of SRP.

Delta Theta in 1954, what guar-
antee does the student body have
that the administration will up-
hold this agreement if it will not
enforce the Michigan Plan at this
time?

2. There will be a new Student
Government in power in 1954.

All campus organizations with
discriminatory clauses snould be
required to repudiate these claus-
es by October 10, 1954, concluded
Graff. He asserted that this pro-
posal was much closer to the in-
tent of the Michigan Plan as it
now exists. Graff further stated
that both parties ran on platforms
promising to enforce the Michi-
gan Plan this year, and it would
be “far better to risk the anger
of the Dean than to lose our own
integrity. Having failed to get the
Stein amendment (the original
proposal calling for repudiation
of the discriminatory clause by
October, 1954, regardless of the
outcome of the national conven-
tion) we have only one honorable
course left — to take Phi Delta
Theta to the Student Faculty-
Administration Court and suffer
the consequences.”

O’Connor refused to answer
questions of the senator from
Wisconsin as to whether he
was a member of the “communist
conspiracy,” or the Communist
party, citing the first amendment,
and arguing that the committee
was never authorized to inquire,
into peoples political beliefs. He
has been cited for contempt of
Congress.

The reason cited for calling O’-
Connor by the committee is that
his books were purchased for
overseas libraries by the State De-
partment, and that the royalties
from the sale of these books were
going into the coffers of the “com-
munist conspiracy.” (McCarthy’s
committee is investigating gov-
ernment spending.) O’Connor de-
nied that he had ever received any
royalties from the sale of these
books to the state department,
and attacked McCarthy’s ration-
ale as being predicated on false
assumptions, lies, and fabrica-
tions

O’Connor insisted that the time
has come for American citizens to
defend their rights against inquis-
itorial investigators. “I’m perfect-

ly willing to discuss my opposition
to communism with anyone who
asks me in a friendly way, but
they are none of Joe’s business,''
he stated.

O’Connor’s speech was preceded
by Professor Sharp’s general dis-
cussion of the past and present
status of the first amendment. He
felt that the Supreme Court deci-
sion in the Dennis case made it
clear that the first amendment
no longer protects Communist ac-
tivity, since the rather muddled
"clear and present danger” doc-
trine has been extended on the
basis that the party is part of an
international conspiracy. Sharp
felt that O’Connor’s case was
clearly distinguished, however,
and that in addition the question
of the committee’s power and of
the separation of the legislative
from the judicial branches were
solid legal grounds.

Frank Kirk, SRP civil liberties
chairman, stated that his organ-
ization supported O'Connor in his
stand.

O’Connor has authored several
historical biographies.

THEY STARTED OUT EVEN AT GRADUATION:

You may not see it in their outward appear-
ances — but there’s a big difference between
these young men. One has held three jobs
in the five years since graduation. He’s
still looking for a job that offers him a
lifetime career, lite other has been with
a Bell Telephone Company during that
time. He’s on his way up!

Seventy-five per cent of college men
hired by the Bell Companies since World
War II are still with these telephone com-
panies after five years! Here’s why:

Telephone Work Is Interesting — You may
train to supervise forces engaged in construct-
ing, installing or maintaining telephone facili-
ties; or to manage groups of people handling
customer contact, accounting or statistical
work. You may work on engineering problems
or be engaged in planning or other important
staff activities, such as personnel relations,
public relations, or revenue studies.

You Grow with a Growing Business —The
Bell System is one of the fastest growing busi-
nesses in the world. Since the end of World
War II, it has spent about nine billion dollars
for new construction. The past five years have
seen the introduction of network TV trans-
mission, dialing of Long Distance calls and
the development of the remarkable transistor.
And the next fixe years will bring many more
changes. In addition, each year the number
of college people hired is related to estimates
of the number of future management positions
to be available.

No matter what your military status, it’s
worth inquiring about Bell System em-
ployment opportunities. Your Placement
Officer has the details. See him soon. And
be sure to talk to our employment repre-
sentatives when they visit the campus. The
time to plan your future is now!

Harold H. Nelson, 75, Egyptologist of the Oriental Institute
and authority on organization of Egyptian temples, died Sun-
day of a cerebral hemorrhage at Billings. Nelson had been
sick for the week previous to his death.

A graduate of UC, Nelson received his bachelor’s degree
in 1901 and his doctorate in philosophy in 1913. Nelson
organized and was field direc-
tor of the Oriental Institute
epigraphic and architectural

survey in Luxor, Egypt for 22
years. The survey, organized in
1924, is now the only American
expedition to Egypt.

Nelson headed the University
study of the ancient temples
which the Pharos built for their
gods at Medinet, Habu and Kar-
nak until his retirement in 1946.
After World War II, Nelson, then
professor emeritus, returned to
the Luxor site for four more sea-

sons. Before his appointment to
the Institute staff, Nelson served
as professor of history at the
American University in Beirut.

Author and co-author of 12
books on Egypt, Nelson was re-
sponsible for six volumes of copy-
ings of the Egyptian temples. He
was presented with a chevalier of
the order of Leopold by the Bel-
gian government, was named a
“Notable” of Egypt, and elected
a corresponding member of the
German Archeological Institute.

Quiz to give students chance
for winning money, watches

A UC student team will take part in the National Broad-
casting Company’s radio quiz program, the College Quizbowl.
The Student Government and Dean Strozier’s office were
invited last week to make ar-
rangements for selecting a
four-man team to broadcast
on February 25.

The popular quiz program runs
in the form of a competition be-
tween two universities or col-
leges; each school, broadcasting
over telephone wires strung be-
tween its campus and the radio
station, tries to be the first to an-
swer a “toss-up” question. If one
team is successful, it is awarded a
number of “bonus” questions
which it may answer without com-
petition from the other team. The
high scoring team during the half-
hour program is then named win-

ner, and the school it is represent-
ing receives $500 from NBC, to be
spent on the extracurriculum as
the students and administration
determine. The winning team con-
tinues on the program from week
to week until it is defeated.

Candidates may be in either the
college or the divisions, but may
not yet have a degree, including
the UC BA. The questions involve
largely knowledge of facts in the
fields of history, literature, geog-
raphy, music, art, sports, and so
on. Interested students should
submit their names to the Student
Activities Office, Reynolds Club,
before the weekend.

Discuss socialist
youth movement

The Politics Club has scheduled
discussion of the forthcoming so-
cialist youth convention in New
York for its first meeting of the
winter quarter on Wednesday at
8 p.m. in Ida Noyes. The conven-
tion, to take place the weekend of
February 12, has been called by
the Young People’s Socialist Par-
ty, formerly known as the youth
section of the Socialist Party, and
the Socialist Youth League.

Informal dress at
Ida Noyes party

“Strictly Comfortable,” an in-
formal party at Ida Noyes Hall
from 7 to 10 p.m. will provide an
opportunity for divisional and col-
lege students to talk and hear
Mrs. Wax of the College social sci-
ences staff play her guitar.

A new Victor radio-phonograph
will be giv^n as a door prize to
some girl attending the gathering.
There will be no admission
charge. Casual dress, even blue
jeans, will be acceptable.

For the first time in several years Hitchcock-Snell hall is
without a night matron. Since last Monday residents in these
quarters have been using newly issued keys for the front door.
The change is a result of the administration’s recent efforts
to cut down on non-academic expenses as much as possible.

The night matron, who answered the phone, took messages

for the residents, and opened
the door to residents after 11
p.m., was also very important
in the case of a fire in the build-
ing. This last point was stressed
by Larry Draper, president of the
Hitchcock ■ Snell house council.
Speaking for the council he said
that under these new conditions
the fire alarm system was deplor-
able. For example, he stated, if a
resident were to discover a fire
in one of the rooms he would first
have to ring the hand alarm bell,
one of which is located on each
floor, then he would have to rush
dqwn-stairs to the desk where the
control board for the buzzer sys-
tem is located, ring all of the
buzzers to wake the other resi-
dents, phone the fire department,
then rush back to the room and
attempt to control the fire. Before
the change, the operation was
relatively simple. He would ring
the hand alarm, call the matron;
who would notify the fire depart-
ment and ring the buzzers; and
then have time to wake those
near-by. Draper continued by say-
ing that the lack of a matron
would also make’it easier for non-
residents to enter and rob any
rooms which happened to be open.
“With so many people owning
keys to the door,” he said, “it’s
very likely that it will be left open
sometimes.”

Rugs lifted

Draper also stated that “chang-
ing the facilities after the con-
tracts had been signed, though
not a breach of contract, was cer-
tainly a breach of faith.” He was
also afraid that this might be part
of a trend. He cited the removal

of room rugs without notice as
being more evidence of a possible
trend.

The trouble arises from the ad-
ministration’s recent, and appar-
ently stringent, attempts to bal-
ance the University’s budget.
Hitchcock-Snell’s budget was re-
turned to the Resident Hall’s busi-
ness council by the administra-
tion three times, until the night
matron service was dropped to
meet the budget demands.

Grip not worried

Mr. Carl Grip, director of uni-
versity house system, though not
responsible for the change,
thought it would not be detrimen-
tal to the house, and wondered
that it had not been done sooner.
“The residents are mature
enough,” he said, “and I don’t
think it will create any problem.”

Grip did admit the fire system
would need careful investigation,
but he also said that the chances
of robbery occuring were no bet-
ter than in any other residence.
Cut necessary

Miss McCarn, assistant dean of
students, said that the Adminis-
tration Budget Commission re-
quired the reduction, and had ad-
vised the Residence Hall Council
on what to do to cut expenses. She
said she thought the house would
be able to function without a night
matron. She had no comment on
the fire alarm system.

Correspondence

We of the Korean Intercollegiate Stu-
dents’ Club, consisting of students of
various colleges and universities in
Seoul area, feel the honor to write this
letter to you. We organized our club in
Jan., 1953, for the following purposes;
1) To develop the intercollegiate rela-
tionships among the students in various
schools. 2) To research and discuss
about all studies and to raise and firm
our knowledges, to behave ourselves as
cultured men and women abreast world-
ly noted scholars and professors. 3) To
reconstruct Korean Civilization and cul-
tures compared to the leading countries
and our individual culture.

All members are so much Interested
in the student’s life in United States,
especially in their club activity, that
we have been inviting speakers who are
mostly American civilians and officers,
and to listen in their speech. If you are
interested in some articles of Korean
students’ life including our club in
Seoul, send us suggestions of that arti-
cles. So, henceforth, we would like to
exchange correspondence with you.

Speaking of general students situa-
tion, we think that reading is most
important things to promote knowl-
edges, but unfortunately there is no
such adequate circumstance for us to
read books. As most of students haven’t
a textbook, we have to use mimeograph
books and notes from class except a few
students. The books in school library
are mostly old edition, published in
Japanese in fifteen years ago or more
before that, but only small quantity of
new editions. The text in English are
used from the first year in college but
are much too few. For the above reason,
it is unable to satisfy passion of read-
ing for many thousand students with
the small quantity of books.

If your students would be able to
contribute us some books, it will give
us a great *power to establish a little
library ourselves.

Dear Editor, I wish that you will
communicate this letter to every stu-
dents’ organization in your school.

Hits SG board

I wish to make clear to the campus
as a whole my reasons for resigning
from the Student Government student
services control board, which was cre-
ated, and rightly so from an efficiency
point of view, at the first of this school
year to “supervise the functioning of
the book exchange, ticket agency, mime-
ograph service and all other projects
which the government specifies.” Later
the loan service was included. Jurisdic-
tion was to be over hiring and firing,
rates and salaries, “negotiation of pur-
chase of equipment and supplies’’ and
investigation of means of expansion. In
other words, it was to be a quasi-judi-
cial, commission -type of bureaucracy,
coordinating administration of four
minor services, none of which the ma-
jority of the campus has ever seen or
heard of, I’ll wager. And since nothing
is completely non-political, I was ap-
pointed as the sole member from the
minority group in government, Student
Representative Party.

Now I object for two reasons to the
charter recently effected for the mime-
graph service, which the board is forced
to administer. It was negotiated with
the director of student activities with-
out the advice of or notice to the
board, which presumably Is quite ex-
pert in such matters, and which has
useful and relevant advice. The high-
handed manner in which this was
handled admits the possibility of
neither controversy or of possible com-
promise of poistion. And, I sincerely be-
lieve as an individual, that this charter
is an obvious and direct sell-out of the
high principles for which a student
needs program should stand: “the
equipment of the Service is the property
of the University, located on University
property, and under the supervision of
the Dean of Students Office,’’ but “the
student service control board, an agent
of the assembly (Student Government)
shall operate the Service.” Thus we re-
main in the old situation of no one
knowing how far his powers extend,
complete nebulousness and nearly zero
accomplishment. My outspoken opinion
was that the student body should either
attempt to start buying the mimeo ma-
chine immediately, or else rent or lease
it on some firm, legal, contractual basis,
it being a “student service*’ of SG. This
was not done. If such a policy would
not be agreeable to the present owner
(and I’m not so sure it wouldn’t, if
adequate assurances regarding repay-
ment o fthe huge deficit the thing runs,
could be made) then let him operate it.
He owns the equipment and supervises
the operation; how is this different
from actual operation, except of course
that students (Including Student Gov-
ernment) do the work?

Now this is of course an extremely in-
significant aspect of the total students-
in-the-unlevrsity problem. But such a
microcosm can be useful for determin-
ing total orientation, and it is certainly
indicative in this case of a faulty ap-
proach: quashing of attempts at clari-
fication.

Professors fired at Calif., Boston

“It is all right to be a conservative when the juice is dried
up in you, but there is something wroiw with a young person
today, especially in our rich and affiuent United States, who
is not idealistically inspired to the point of belonging to a
communis,t socialist, anarchist or similarly inspired group.”

Last fall the Daily Californian attributed that statement

to Harold Winkler, young as-
sistant professor of political
science (without tenure) at
the University of California. The
quotation was included in a rou-
tine report of an off-campus
speech.

Early this month Winkler was
notified that he was being re-
leased from the University fac-
ulty.

Winkler claims he is being
dropped because of his political
views. Chancellor Clark Kerr says
the decision was made “on the
basis of teaching, research, uni-
versity and public service, and
professional competence.” Peter
Odegard, chairman of the political
science department, calls Wink-
ler “a very gifted teacher” and
denounces a trend toward
“thought control.”

Winkler also claims the Daily
Californian misquoted his speech,
and that what he really said was:
“I can well understand how in the
comparatively rich United States
during/the decades of the 30’s and
40’s young people were idealistic-
ally motivated to join communist,
socialist or anarchist groups. Con-
servatism, when the juice is dried
up in one’s veins, is understand-
able, but there is something
wrong with a youngster who is
not motivated by generous com-
passion for the underprivileged of
the world.”

Californian city editor Bob
Trip, however, maintains the quo-
tation was accurate and that he
checked personally on the story
with Winkler before printing it.

But, says Californian editor Geor-

tion II, A, 8, e:

1.	However, campus
ated with national

following be

Code as Sec-

groups allill-
organizations

that have discriminatory clauses in
their national constitution after
October 1, 1953, may appeal to the
Student Assembly lor an extension
of recognition until November 1,
1954.

2.	After November 1, 1954, such
organizations shall automatically
lose recognition and shall be Ineli-
gible to receive further automatic
or official recognition, unless one of
the following conditions has been
fulfilled:

A. In the cast of a local organi-
zation whose national organization
has adopted an amendment strik-
ing the discriminatory clause sub-
ject to ratification at one further
convention of the organization,
the local organization must file a
statement to this efect with the
Student Government and the Dean
of Students’ office by November 1,
1954. If this aforesaid amendment
to the national constitution is not
finally ratified by the next meet-
ing of the national organization,
the local organization shall be en-
titled to receive recognition only
undet condition B below.

B. In any case not covered by
condition A above, it shall be nec-
essary for the organization in
question to file yearly public state-
ments that the organization is not
bound by any discriminatory
clauses in its constitution, local
and national. This condition shall
be considered fulfilled only if In
the period of October 10 through
November 1 of each year the or-

when a statement is filed after
the first national convention, as
indicated in A above, that state-
ment shall suffice until November
1 of the year in which the second
convention occurred. This loss of
recognition shall not necessitate
action on the part of the Student
Assembly, but shall be automatic-
ally enforced by the eDan of Stu-
dents’ office.

This proposed amendment
was approved by the Dean’s
office and recommended by the
Committee on Recognized Stu-
dent Organizations.

Hither and Yon .

(from poge 4)

fy before the Jenner internal
security committee, and sus-
pended ancr the university re-
ceived a letter from Attorney-
General Herbert Brownell say-
ing Halperin had betrayed the
government by “passing on in-
formation to an espionage
courier” while he was a State
department employee.

A 19-year-old pre law student at
the University of Colorado who’s
avocation is hunting Reds has
been branded “intellectually dis-
honest” by the university board
of publications.

The student, Dwight D. Mur-
phey, charged “a Communist con-
spiracy on our campus” and, to-
gether with a state legislator,
accused a political science profes-
sor of using pro-communist text-
books in his “Governments of
Eastern Asia” class.

The story began when Murphey
brought a 1,200-word press release
to the Colorado Daily, which edi-
tor Rod Angove refused to print
on the grounds that portions of it
were libelous.

Murphey was not enrolled in
the Asia course, nor had he read
the textbooks. He based his
charges solely on the fact that
four of the authors studied in the
course—Lawrence K. Rosinger,
T. A. Bisson, Owen Lattimore,
and Fairbank—have been accused
of being Communists before Con-
gresisonal committees.

Editor Angove termed Murphey
a “troublemaker,” and the young
anti-Communist appealed to the
board of publications that he had
been frozen out of the paper un-
justly.

At the board meeting Murphey
said he was not calling the pro-
fessor a Communist, but merely
insisting that he point out to his
students that the authors of the
texts are Communists. “But that
would be a lie, Mr. Murphey,” ad-
monished a sociology professor on
the board. “You haven’t estab-
lished that these authors are Com-
munists.”

Another board member, the di-
rector of the college of journal-
ism, asked if the authors were
“convicted or accused” Commu-
nists. “Well,” Murphey replied,

• •

“these people are so slippery you
can’t prove anything before a
court of law. So other means must
be taken.”

The board lauded Angove for
his actions and labeled Murphey
“irresponsible and intellectually
dishonest.”

A month ago University of
Toronto students — dressed in
Ku KIux Klan robes and shout-
ing “Joe’s our foe! Joe’s a
shmoe!” — burned Sen. Joseph
McCarthy in effigy.

Now more irate students at
the University of British Co-
lumbia have undertaken an-
other burning. They strung up,
in effigy, Col. Robert McCor-
mick, publisher of the Chicago
Tribune. McCormick’s dummy
was stuffed with copies of the
Tribune and hung before being
set ablaze.

The burning was a protest
against the Tribune’s recent at-
tacks on Lester B. Pearson,
Canadian Minister of External
Affairs.

Blue Cross Plan
for UC faculty

Arrangements have been made
with the Blue Cross plan for hos-
pital care to admit faculty mem-
bers and regular employes who
had previously declined partici-
pation, or had not had the oppor-
tunity to participate, in the Uni-
versity payroll-deduction group.
Present subscribers also may
change their contracts from “sin-
gle” to “family” contract by add-
ing spouse or children under
nineteen years of age.

Application cards and literature
explaining the benefits of the com-
prehensive plan may be obtained

Gottschalk talk airs quandary

By Merrill Rodin

Professor Louis Gottschalk figuratively admitted an audience of 500 into the intimacy
of an Augustinian type confessional. For his presidential address to the American Histori-
cal Association at its annual meeting last December 29, the University of Chicago historian
chose to reflect upon a personal, though not unrepresentative, quandary which has per-
plexed him throughout his teaching career: what are the social obligations of a historian,
and how, in the light of these obligations, should the historian be educated?

Clothing his remarks in au-
tobiographical apparel, Gott-
schalk recounted the stages
through which he passed in solv-
ing these dilemmas to his own
satisfaction. Contemporary Amer-
ican society, he decided long ago,
has little or no use for the con-
scientious historian’s preoccupa-
tion with the highly specialized
problems of traditional research;
“whether Lafayette found his lib-
eral ideas in the atmosphere of
18th century France or in the
American Revolution,” declared
the author of the $1,000-prize book
Lafayette Between the American
Revolution and the French Revo-
lution, “simply (does) not have
general appeal” to “a society that
is fearful of annihilation.”

Gottschalk, faced with the con-
clusion that perhaps liveliness of
reconstruction and brilliance of
style, were all that the public de-
manded of historians, recalled
that such abstruse writers as
Spengler and Toynbee had man-
aged to attain a high, degree of
popularity. Pondering this prob-
lem over the years, Gottschalk be-
came more' convinced that “the
social importance of history . . .
lies more in the way historians
think on persistent problems than
on either their subject matter or
their style. On a priori grounds
. . . the world can be assumed to
need the lessons of its experience.

... And where can those lessons
be found if not in the historical
facts concerning men? . . . And
who can better discern and pre-
sent the lessons they teach than a
historian of a critical and philo-
sophical bent?"

Although he was certain that
America should justifiably de-
mand from its historians the
uniqueness of their insight, Gott-
schalk could not dispel his quan-
dry without first discovering the
constituents of this “historical-
mindedness.” He began to envis-
age a logical synthesis which

might comprehend the opposi-
tions between those who would in-
terpret the past exclusively in its
own terms and those who sought
to interpret it in terms of the
present, between those who in-
sisted on the contingency of the
historical process and those who
embraced determinism, and be-
tween disinterested description
and moral judgment of historical
subjects. On this basis, he was
able to come up with a 5-fold
recipe for the socially responsible
historian, stressing the ability to
“attempt contrasts and compari-
sons of historical episodes, situa-
tions, and institutions in order to
build stringent categories of
man’s recurrent experiences,” and
to “propose generalizations about

human behavior that have uni-
versal validity.”

Fom these penultimate conclu-
sions, Gottschalk finally formulat-
ed a practicable answer to his
pedagogic query. Drawing upon his
27 years of teaching experience at
the University of Chicago, he es-
poused a 3-level program for train-
ing prospective historians; elemen-
tary courses on events and the
differing interpretations of events
would occasion familiarity with “the
data" of history, individual pro-
jects would emphasixe "the meth-
od" by stressing the mechanics off
research, and the study of past
historians would inculcate "the his-
torical insight" by focusing on the
persistent problems, tentative an-
swers, philosophies of continuity
and change, judgments of men ond
institutions, and even the proph-
ecies which great historians have
permitted themselves.

Gottschalk finished his address
by summing up the considera-
tions which ultimately mitigated
his recurrent perplexities. Only by
“putting their minds to work
upon the continuing problems of
human existence” can historians
discharge their social obligation
to “pilot the course of humanity’s
perpetual aspirations after the
good, the true, and the beautiful.”

Mandel concert to feature
Seeger and Bill Broonzy

Saturday night’s folk concert in Mandel brings together
two of the most interesting personalities in American Folk
music. Pete Seeger’s long-necked five-string banjo playing
has its roots in the mountains of Tennessee, and Big BiU
Broonzy’s blue guitar improvisations come from the city slums
and southern chain gangs. Ticket sales for the concert have
been brisk.

John and Alan Lomax, for-
mer directors of the Library
of Congress folk music section
describe Seeger as “The tall, thin
Yankee, who can make a banjo
weep like a willow and mourn
like a dove . . . one of America’s
unique musicians.” It was the
Lomaxes who, in the late nine-

teen-thirties, started Seeger on
his career that has included per-
formances in such diverse places
as New York’s Washington
Square and Chicago’s Pump
Room. He has made records for
Decca (with the Weavers) that
sold millions, and records for
small companies that sold per-

haps a hundred. He has received
top billing at leading night spots,
and played for haircuts in barber-
shops. He has brought folk music
to audiences totally unfamiliar
with it.

Big Bill Broonzy was, in the
words of his friend and tutor
Huddie (Leadbelly) Ledbettor,
“born with the blues.” The easy,
rambling style that he first picked
up in his youth in the slums of
Little Rock, Ark., has now ac-
quired polish through years of
association with such artists as
Jelly Roll Morton and Blind
Lemon Jefferson. He has recorded
thousands of sides, and is now
under contract with Chess rec-
ords. In the tradition of blues
guitarists, his style is improvisa-
tional. He has a large following
in Paris, and has made several
tours of Europe.

Pete Seeger currently resides

near Beacon, N. Y., a commu-
nity 50 miles up the Hudson
from New York. He and his
wife and children are building
a house on a mountain there.
In the summer, Pete’s folksing-
ing friends come up to the
mountain, camp in pup tents
on the slope, and help with the
building of the house, laying
water pipe, and building a road
(the road leading to his house
is passable only by jeep). He
plays at summer resorts and
camps, and in “Hootenannies”
at New York’s Pythian Temple,
and makes records on the Stin-
son and Folkways labels.

Broonzy currently operates a
bar at 36th and Cottage Grove
Ave. in Chicago, where he plays
with a three-piece blues combo.
He appears at the Blue Angel
with Studs Terkel and banjoist

Fleming Brown on Monday
nights. He played in Mandel
Hall two years ago in SU’s I
Come for to Sing concert.

Panorama of Qerman art in Qoodspeed
shows variety within woodcut medium

The pleasure of viewing the exhibition of 20th Century German Graphic Art now at the Renaissance So-
ciety Gallery comes, in great part, from one's realization of the particular receptiveness of the woodcut
medium to expressionistic technique. Prints by the pre-World War I "Brucke" group reveal the impatience
and excitement with which artists like Nolde, Kirchner, Schmidt-Rottluff, Pechstein, Heckel and Mueller

gouged and hacked their
torments in the rugged
wood. Held in check by the
material they worked with and
further restricted to the use of
black and white, these artists
found a medium with sufficient
resistance to discipline and form-
alize their emotions. It is as if, in
attacking the wood, they had at-
tacked life itself and planted their
expression upon it.

In four prints on exhibit at
Nolde, the viewer becomes in-
corporated iiito the picture as
he finds one character in each
print staring him straight in
the eye. Having thus involved
and, perhaps, condemned his.
viewer, the artist proceeds to
evoke tensions and ironies by
exploiting the most subtle po-
tentialities of his technique. In
“Family,” the roughness and

uncertainty of escape are im-
plied by the jagged quality of
the cut and the startling sur-
faces of black and white. “Re-
clining Nude” succeeds in its
irony because of a contradiction
between the peaceful attitude
and the disturbing treatment.

Ernst Kirchner is another of
the Brucke group to discover the
unique possibilities of the wood-
cut. His “Cow Herder” never com-
pletely emerges from the rustic
wood with which he blends to be-
come one with his environment.

Though the woodcuts are the *
outstanding feature of the ex-
hibition, other print techniques
— etching and lithograph — are
also shown. The manner by
which the prints have been sel-
lected and arranged is very in-
structive, for we are allowed to
follow the graphic arts in their

development from expression-
ism, through the more poetic
work of Marc and Kandinsky,
thence into the symbolism of
Paul Klee (whose development
is summarized in three prints
moving from realistic allegory
to his better-known imaginative
interpretations of man); final-
ly, we are shown some excellent
examples of the “New Objec-
tivity” that emerged in the pe-
riod between the wars. This last
group, including Grosz, Dix and
Beckmann, is frankly proletar-
ian and often becomes nothing
more than political cartooning.
One drypoint, however, “The
Declaration of War” by Beck-
mann, raises light and shadow
to a theological level. As light
passes with seeming swiftness
over a crowd, secret hopes and
fears are suddenly exposed as

if in response to the presence
of light or darkness.

The exhibition, though modest,
makes a solid impression. One is
always aware of the great tradi-
grown. There is an influence of
folk art in the primitive bluntness
of works like Nolde’s “Prophet”
or Pechstein’s “South Sea Island-
ers,” a color lithograph; and the

It is satisfying to see how this
old tradition was taken up and
revitalized in Germany during
a period when methods were
being sought to express inward
psychological turmoil. The ex-
hibition which runs through
February 6 is a reminder that
the graphic arts have a more
significant and original reason
for being than simply as a
means of mass production.

Kurt Weill, is now playing at the Playrights Theatre Club, 1560 N. LaSalle. It is scheduled to run Wednes-

days through Sundays until February.

Three Penny Opera is adapted from Gay's Beggar's Opera and shares the fault of most Brecht. It suffers

from the limitations that
the old plot (and in the
cases of other Brecht plays —
the remote settings) places
upon the new (and contemporary)
situations. These limitations —
elusive indirect symbolism, vague
broad characterizations, and in-
decisive plot development — only
obscure the meaning of the play.
But wharfs more important, these
limitations make no one interpre-
tation, including that which
Brecht intended, the correct one
(although some insight into the
circumstances which led to the
writing of the play might reveal
the one closest to correct). For
this reason, every interpretation
is best considered in the light of
its own consistency and reality;
for when well interpreted and di-
rected, a Brecht play becomes a
valuable experience.

As interpreted by the Play-
wrights company — under the
direction of Paul Sills, who did
Brecht’s “Caucasian Chalk Cir-
cle” for University Theatre last
year—“Three Penny Opera” is
a plea for “mercy” toward those
who suffer “the uncertainty of
human circumstances.” It cen-

ters around British “lumpen”
elements: a “small business-
man” who makes use of the “la-
bor” of beggars for his own
ends and a clever criminal who
exploits the endeavors of his
criminal vassals to gain fame,
comfort, a collection of wives,
and the willing services of a
group of prostitutes.

Between the two are a chief of

Estelle Lutrelle

police whose inconvenient bond of
friendship with the criminal is
ellucidated in an ironic song de-
scribing their comradeship in the
colonial adventures of the British
Army (bringing strikingly to
mind current happenings in Ken-
ya and South Africa), and the
group of prostitutes who find
their loyalty divided between
pleasure and bribery. The story
develops into a situation in which
the “businessman” and his beg-
gars in revolt stop the Queen’s
coronation, and the criminal—be-
trayed— is condemned to hang.
Then mercy is made to come in a
totally absurd manner (which,
with nuances of a better existence
and digs at the prevailing order,
suggests another interpretation)
and thus all ends for the best —
with reservations to reality.

Sills’ interpretation is well
borne out in its application. He
uses a bare but vividly painted
set, simple but provocative cos-
tumes, and bright fairly static
lighting, leaving the burden of
interest to fall upon stage move-
ment, of which there is much,
and the music, which for the
most part is surprisingly well

sung and played. Indeed the
cast is provided with a vehicle
for visual expression in the best
Chaplin-Clair (and Follies Ber-
gere) tradition. All elements of
music, voice, and staging are
combined into remarkably bal-
anced and well timed comedy.

The cast works skillfully within
the interpretation. Edward Asner,
as the “businessman” fits well in
Sills’ conception and develops
more than the others, an image of
an immediate contemporary type,
as Brecht probably intended. In
the principle role, the criminal,
Eugene Troobnick does an excel-
lent job of comedy while effec-
tively developing the weakness of
disposition of the character. Nev-
ertheless, he sometimes draws
too much attention to himself,
thereby reducing the other actors
to mechanical props.

Estelle Lutrelle, as one of the
wives of the criminal, is able to
portray joy with believability
and sadness with effect, while
not distracting from the total
comedy. Yet, in her scenes with
Barbara Harris, who plays the
other wife, both she and Miss
Harris become too immobile

Eugene Troobnick

and rely excessively on dialogue
often inadequately timed.

The rest of the cast shows uni-
form excellence in carrying
through the line of the play.

This production of “Three
Penny Opera” presents a com-
mmendable conception of
the play. It is interpreted with
a view toward comedy and its
comedy is superb and biting.

When you come right down to it, you
smoke for one simple reason . . . enjoy-
ment. And smoking enjoyment is all a
matter of taste. Yes, taste is what counts
in a cigarette. And Luckies taste better.

Two facts explain why Luckies taste
better. First, L.S./M.F.T.—Lucky Strike
means fine tobacco ... light, mild, good-
tasting tobacco. Second, Luckies are ac-
tually made better to taste better . . •
always round, firm, fully packed to draw
freely and smoke evenly.

So, for the enjoyment you get from
better taste, and only from better taste,
