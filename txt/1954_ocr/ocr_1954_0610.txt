University of Chicago, June 10, 1954

Order of the 'C' seeking
scholarships for athletes

Plans for raising funds to expand the University’s program of "athletic scholarships” have
been approved by Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton and Dean of Students Robert M. Stro-
zier. The announcement of approval was made by Frank Whiting, president of the Order of
the "C,” the University lettermen’s association, at the order’s annual dinner Thursday in the
Quadrangle Club.

The original scholarship fund was established in 1951 with $3,000 to provide scholarships

for students "of high academic
standing who w ould be inter-
ested in participating in var-
sity athletics.” The present funds
for the scholarships would be col-
lected by the Order of the “C”
members and would be disposed
of by the Scholarship Committee
in substantially the same manner.
Strozier, chairman of the Scholar-
ship Committee, outlined the fol-
lowing procedure for awarding
the scholarships in a letter to
Whiting:

“Candidates for the awards
could be recommended by mem-
bers of the Order and by mem-
bers of the athletic staff. Such
candidates should be told that the
first step would be to make ap-
plication through the Admissions
Office and then to take the en-
trance examinations. When these
conditions had been met satisfac-
torily, a sub - committee of the
Scholarship Committee would re-
view the individual application
and determine the award to be
made.”

Strozier, however, added that
“it is not absolutely necessary”
for a student to take the scholar-
ship examination to be awarded a
scholarship. He added, “If, accord-
ing to normal procedure, a stu-
dent does not come up to the level
of a scholarship student, but we
still think he will do well, he
may be awarded a remission of
tuition.”

Explaining that “athletic schol-
arship” meant “buying athletes,”
T. Nelson Metcalf said “there is
no plan for anything that, it seems
to me, can be called an athletic

all approve of

The scholarship plan for bringing more athletes
to Chicago has met with the approval of Chancel-
lor Lawrence A. Kimpton (left), Director of Ath'
letics T. Nelson Metcalf (center) and Chairman

of the Scholarship Committe Robert M. Strozier
(right). The plan was announced at the Order of
the “C” dinner Thursday in the Quadrangle Club.

Give changes
in convocation

Times for tomorrow’s convo-
cation have been changed as
follows: Bachelor’s degrees will
be conferred at 10:30 a.m. and
higher degrees at 3:00 p.m. in
Rockefeller Chapel.

scholarship. ... I would object
strenuously to anything that was
an out-and-out athletic subsidy.”

Metcalf explained that the
scholarships would be awarded on
the basis of academic achieve-
ment, financial need and interest
and demonstrated record in ex-
tra-curricular activities, including
athletics.

Whiting, who had cleared the
plan in advance with Kenneth L.
“Tug” Wilson, athletic commis-
sioner of the Big 10, thought this
program was the first step in re-
building the athletic prowess of
Chicago teams. First emphasis, he
said, would be on track and bas-
ketball, and later football.

“How fast Chicago can develop
the type of men and team neces-
sary for a return to big time foot-
ball, we do not know,” he said,
“but its return to a position of
prominence in Big 10 football,
while obviously one of our major
objectives, definitely is not some-
thing of the immediate future. . . .
I want to see the day when we
are back in the Big 10 in all sports,
including football,” Whiting con-
cluded.

However, Metcalf said “the Big
10 isn’t interested in Chicago and
Chicago isn’t interested in the Big
10, unless the entire nature of the
University is changed and the un-
der-graduate college becomes a
many times bigger institution.”
Metcalf pointed out that since
1946 when Chicago withdrew from
the Big 10, Michigan State College
has replaced it. With the excep-

Chancellor wan

who are ‘young and healthy’ <

"Hutchins educated only the intellect; we want to educate
the whole boy,” stated Frank Whiting, president of the Order
of the "C,” in explaining the purpose of the new recruitment
and scholarship program proposed at the "C” dinner last
Thursday night.

At the same time, according to 20 "C” men contacted after

tion of Northwestern University,
all the schools in the Big 10 are
state schools with 10 times as
many students eligible for inter-
collegiate athletics as Chicago.

He explained that there would
be no change in the level of com-
petition for UC teams, saying that
the school sought teams on its
own level. “The ideal schedule is
one where our teams win half the
contests and lose half,” he ex-
plained. When asked about plans
for football, he replied “absolutely
none!”

However, the newspapers de-
scribed— in what Metcalf called
“misconceptions”—the sports re-
vival with headlines such as:

MAROONS PLAN SPORTS
FUND, RETURN TO GRID

BIG TIME FOOTBALL
IS GOAL OF MAROONS

In Stockton, California, Amos
Alonzo Stagg commented that he
was “glad” the University of Chi-
cago was thinking of making a
return to big-time football compe-
tition. The former UC football
coach added that he hoped the
University was not “going into a
wide-open plan of athletic schol-
arships.”

Writing for the Associated
Press, Whitney Martin said: “We
can see no harm in athletic schol-
arships . . . we believe Chicago
belongs in the Big 10.” He added,
“It has always been our conten-
tion that a college football player
should also be a student.”

the dinner, Chancellor Kimp-
ton stated that the University
had a reputation for being
“queer,” and added “therefore this
school has attracted every God
damned queer kid in the area.”
Kimpton later denied ever having
made the statement.

Kimpton continued, “I said only
what I have said many times be-
fore—that the undergraduate en-
rollment has fallen, and the rea-
son it has fallen is due to the er-
ronious impression that we are a
school for quiz kids. I think that
we are a normal, broad, healthy
institution. When I went around
the country I tried to combat this
‘quiz kid’ impression. Our general
education program is so good that
it would be too bad to limit it to
the upper one per cent of the col-
lege students in the country. I
want a broad cross section of
young, healthy Americans.”

The median student admitted
to UC scores in the 93 percentile
(of those admitted to college), of
the college entrance boards exam,
Kimpton pointed out. This is too
high; it means that we are scar-
ing away a whole series of kids
w'ho just don’t apply to UC. We
are losing people who are going to
become leaders in the world of
tomorrow, concluded Kimpton.

Whiting, Order of the “C” presi-
dent. said that his group wants
to aid the Chancellor by trying to
increase enrollment. “What we
need at UC is more people who
are interested in extracurricular
activities.” Whiting, a UC alun>
nus who graduated in 1917, ex-
plained “We want a well bal-
anced type of kid, of which ath-
letes are only one type.

“The present administration
has done the University a great
service in bringing back a more
orthodox educational set-up,” said
Whiting. “With the four year de-
grees we will not have so many
14 and 15 year olds; the older boys
will have a better chance in ath-
letic competition.”

“Since we are all letter winners,
naturally we are interested in ath-
letics,” remarked Whiting. “We
would like to set up a fund to aid
scholastically qualified athletes to
come to UC.”

“How ever I see no reason why
academic standards should be
changed, nor do I think such
change is desirable,” concluded
Whiting.

Four professors
receive awards

The annual awards for excel-
lence in undergraduate teaching
have this year been given to Mark
Ashin, assistant professor of Eng-
lish in the college, Wells Cham-
berlin, assistant professor in the
department of romance languages
and litrature, Beatrice Mintz, as-
sistant professor of biological sci-
ences in the college, and Donald
Meiklejohn, associate professor of
philosophy in the college.

The awards, which consist of
$1,000 in cash, are contributed by
Ernest E. Quantrell, honorary
trustee of the University.

program is not unlike those already in operation.

What i impmtant b fete wttter is toe maimer in which
these scholarship funds were proposed. There tl nothing W*

W'hal is moi" imioi nmalo in this situation is that the
Chair-rllor of the University of Chicago felt called upon to
'hdd fuel to their belief. In doing so, he cast a slur upon the
student body of the University, a slur which is entirely un-

funds, or maintaining a well-rounded program of extra-cur-
