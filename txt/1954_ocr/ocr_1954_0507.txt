US Chief Justice Warren

to dedicate ABA center

Dedication of the American Bar Association headquarters
will take place in Rockefeller Chapel on Aug. 19. The main
speaker will be Chief Justice Earl R. Warren of the United
States Supreme Court.

The subject of Warren’s speech has not yet been decided,

but a spokesman for the Association said that he thought that
he would use the “role of the

bar in American life.”

In addition to Warren, all
other Supreme Court Justices
have been invited. Governor Strat-
ton and Mayor Kennelly are ex-
pected to attend.

Tentative plans for the formal
dedication now include a proces-
sional of all attending dignitaries,
which would take place between
Ida Noyes Hall and the Chapel
just prior to the ceremonies.

Chancellor Kimpton and Ed-
ward Levy, dean of the law’ school,
have been invited to the ceremo-

nies, but it is not known if they
will take part.

Construction of the Center be-
gan last summer. It is located on
60th St. between Woodlawn and
University. The site was donated
by UC to the American Bar Asso-
ciation.

The Center will serve the dual
purpose of headquarters for the
Association and research center.
The first project of the Center
will be a long range study of the
administration of criminal justice
in the US, with a view to modern-
izing and strenthening criminal
law enforcement.

Robeson to sing here?

Paul Robeson, baritone and dramatic actor, will appear with
Alan Booth, pianist, in Mandel Hall tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.
over the protest of the American Legion as reported in the
Southtown Economist.

The front page of last Wednesday’s Economist, the largest
circulation community newspaper in Chicago, carried a story

University of Chicago, May 7, 1954

Kimpton likes Michigan plan,
sees wider role for fraternities

under the banner headline
“Legion Protests Appearance
by Paul Robeson at U. of C.”

The story said “Officials of the
Anti-Subversive committee of the
Cook County council of the Amer-
ican Legion have made a formal
demand upon Chancellor Law-
rence Kimpton of the University
of Chicago to cancel a recital
scheduled to be given in Mandel
Hall Saturday by Paul Robeson,
classified by government agencies
as being a ‘Communist.’ ”

UC will not oct — Kimpton

Yesterday Chancellor Kimpton
told the MAROON that he had
received a letter from the Legion.
Kimpton said the University
would not take any action on the
Legion letter.

Robeson will sing a program of
spirituals, concert arias and songs,
■ and folk songs. Booth will play
piano works by Beethoven, Ka-
balevsky, Schubert, Chopin, Dvo-
rak, and the Chinese composer,
Liu Shea-An.

Among the selections to be sung
by Robeson are Orphan and the
prayer and Death from Boris God-
unov by Mussorgsky; songs by
Schubert and Quilter; Jewish,
Mexican, and Russian folk songs;
and his well known renditions of
Water Boy, Jacob’s Ladder, and
OF Man River. Booth will play ar-
rangements of Deep River and
two African dances in addition to
the classical selections.

Legion deplores 'radicals'

In a formal statement, Edward

Clamage, chairman of the Legion
committee, said “it is beyond our
comprehension why a compara-
tively few radicals . . . should be
permitted ... to bring a notorious
Communist like Robeson on the
campus. . . .

“We join with all loyal citizens
in urging Chancellor Kimpton to
immediately invoke his authority
by nullifying the possible appear-
ance of Robeson. . ..”

The Economist story quoted a
statement by the Student Repre-
sentative Party, sponsors of the
concert, which said in part, “We
do not believe McCarthyism
should be allowed to tell us what
artists we can hear and appreci-
ate.”

Class valedictorian and Phi
Betta Kappa at Rutgers, besides
being a 4-letter man and twice an
All-American end, Robeson start-
ed at tht Columbia Law School,
but became interested in dramat-
ics and finally starred in a reviv-
al of O’Neill’s Emperor Jones. Ro-
beson’s whistling in the play ap-
parently left something to be de-
sired, so he sang instead.

A long line of successes fol-
lowed in America, England and
Europe, and have continued ever
since, along with stage perform-
ances, particularly in “Othello,”
and USO tours. Recently, how-
ever, he has been restricted from
performing in many places and
has been denied a-'passport be-
cause of his views.

University policy toward fraternities was clarified by Chancellor Lawrence
A. Kimpton in an interview with the MAROON yesterday.

"I am supporting Dean Strozier on the Michigan Plan/' Kimpton said. "I op-
pose racial discrimination." The Chancellor stated that he would be very sorry
to see Phi Delta Theta leave the campus, "especially in view of their attitude
toward discrimination and their actions in the national fraternty to eliminate
the ‘selective’clause.” But, he
said, the discriminatory clause

Lawrence A. Kimpton

must be removed if the frater-

nity is to remain at UC.

Kimpton stated that he favored
fraternities in-so-far as they pro-
vided- an element of warmth and
community spirit to the campus,
and added that they aided with
alumni relations. However, he
criticized the tendency of UC fra-
ternities to be warm and friendly

Center changes

The Student Service Center,
Reynolds Club basement, has
shortened its hours in order to trim
the mid-quarter operating loss.
The new hours are 11:30-1:30
and 4:00-5:00, Monday through
Friday. The old hours will be re-
stored before the end of May.

inside the chapter house while be-
ing cold to other campus organiza-
tions. “They take a relatively
small role in groups like Student
Union and the MAROON.”

Chancellor Kimpton said he
would like to see the fraternities
strengthen themselves. “But,” he
said, “that is their problem.... No
financial aid from the University
is contemplated.”

Kimpton stated that there was
no intention at present to bring
more fraternities to campus. “That
is a bridge we will have to cross
when we come to it,” the Chancel-
lor added. Citing the present low
fraternity membership, Kimpton
wondered if there was adequate
campus interest to warrant addi-
tional chapters.

Region delegates
draft proposals
for conference

The Illinois Regional confer-
ence of the National Students
Association will meet tomorrow at
the University of Illinois, Cham-
paign-Urbana. UC will be repre-
sented by the delegates and
alternates elected in the recent
all-campus election.

Yesterday afternoon, the delega-
tion discussed proposals which
they will submit to the regional
assembly. These proposals were
drawn up as a joint program sup-
ported by ISL, SRP, and inde-
pendent delegation members, ac-
cording to Dick Ward, delegation
chairman.

At the final plenary session of
the Illinois meeting, officers will
be elected for Region posts and
resolutions for the forthcoming
NSA national congress will be
drafted.

Tutorial AB desirable: Streeter

To give dance
at Int House

“Dance of the Spheres,” the In-
ternational House formal dance of
the spring quarter, will be held in
the International House assembly
hall, Friday, May 14, at 9:30 p.m.
Eddie James’ orchestra will pro-
vide dance music.

Corsages will be presented to all
the ladies, and refreshments will
be served. Tickets are $1.25 per
couple.

Designer of the ballroom deco-
rations, which will carry out the
heavenly body theme, is Joe Sedel-
maier, Art Institute student.

“The tutorial AB was set up because the faculty of the college thought, even before the
other changes came, that a year of intensive study would be a desirable addition to the col-
lege,” Robert E. Streeter, dean of the college, told the MAROON last week in an interview
on this aspect of the new degree programs.

“The idea was to give the student the experience of doing some independent, original work
before conferring his degree upon him,” continued Streeter. “The program was set up by a
committee, appointed by the
Chancellor, and consisting of
five college and five divisional
people.

Election today

The election for the 1954-1955
editor-in-chief of the MAROON
will take place today at 3:30 p.m.
>n the MAROON office. Only staff
members may attend and only
those on today's masthead may
vote. The MAROON constitution
forbids proxy voting.

Plan flexible and imaginative

The plan they arrived at is an
extremely flexible and imagina-
tive one, providing as it does for
the student to pursue his own in-
terest in his own way with a mini-
mum of required course work.”
Roughly, there will be a tripartite
division of time among courses,
the writing of the bachelor’s es-
say. which will amount to an ex-
tended preceptorial paper, and in-
dependent study, planned in con-
junction with a tutor.

“The new tutorial AB will cer-
tainly enjoy full status as a sub-
stantial and recognized bachelor’s
degree,” Streeter asserted. Most
schools operate on the basis of
relatively uncomplicated arithme-

tic and four years is four years.1

“It was not designed, however,"cept of g

he continued, “as specific prepara-
tion for graduate work; it is in-
tended, rather, to be the capstone
of a liberal education.”

“Because of this difference in
intention, it is possible that stu-
dents completing the tutorial pro-
gram and then entering graduate
work in particular fields may find
it necessary to make up some pre-
requisite courses which they have
by-passed.”

15 or 20 students expected

“We expect 15 or 20 students to
enter the program next fall,”
Streeter said, “although we can’t
be sure until we get back the
questionnaires which have been
sent to all students in the college.”
Tutors will not be appointed until
the number planning to enter is
ascertained. Streeter declined to
hazard a guess as to the future
enrollment in the program.

Asked what changes in the con-
eneral education he

thought the whole new degree
structure of the University has
effected, Streeter said, “It is accu-
rate to say that the new curricula
continue to make possible more
sustained attention to the job of
general education than in any
other college in the US.” The com-
munity of curriculum is gone, but
“we’ll give everyone as much of
the common curriculum as pos-
sible.”

“Members of the college fac-
ulty,” Streeter revealed, “may
someday consider reestablishing a
common curriculum for high
school graduates, with a limited
number of comps.”

14 comps for young students

Robert E. Streeter

“It may be true, though, that we

“As long as we have younger
students, however, a 14-comp cur-
riculum makes good sense. And
the vote for a five-year program
for younger entrants means we
still -expect to have sophomores
entering.”

alienated high school administra-
tors by presuming to tell their stu-
dents that all of them were wast-
ing time in high school. Actually,
we always were careful to take
only the cream of the crop, and
the new rhetoric simply corre-
sponds more closely to our prac-
tice.”

Letters...

Explains action

In light of the letter signed by the
Students’ Representative Party printed
on page four of the April 30 MAROON,
you may wish to print in full in the
next issue of the paper, my letter to
which reference was made therein:

’’April 22, 1954”

‘‘Mr. Paul Breslow. Chairman
Students’ Representative Party
5728 Woodlawn Ave.

Chicago, Ill.

“Dear Mr. Breslow,

“Robert Stein, your representative,
has asked me to write you a note con-
cerning my decision not to approve off-
campus publicity or posters for the cam-
puses of other Chicago schools, adver-
tising the Paul Robeson event, May 8.

“The student regulations read: Stu-
dent activities must be confined to the
campus of the University unless upon
proper application to the office of the
Director of Student Activities, an ex-
ception is made to this rule.

“Paul Robeson has access to a plat-
form on this campus because of the
University's support of the principle
that student organizations may invite
and hear persons of their choice on the
campus, and because the Students’ Rep-
resentative Party chose to invite and
hear Paul Robeson.

“I am proud of the University’s sup-
port of this principle. I am not proud
of SRP’s use of its privilege in this
case. The existence of a right does not
automatically Justify every exercise of
it by its possessor.

“In exercising its privilege through
this invitation, at no time, to my knowl-
edge, did SRP address itself to the larger
interests of the student body or of the
University community. Insofar as I can
determine, in a matter that surely af-
fects the interests of the whole, SRP
substituted its own Judgment of values,
without making any effort to assess or
respect other responsible opinions about
the values Involved.

“It is a very open question, in my
mind, whether the reasons SRP has
given for its invitation to Robeson are
sound. I am sure, however, that the way
your organization has proceeded in this
case has not taken account of interests
involved, much broader than SRP’s.

"In this light I find no basis whatso-
ever for making an exception to the
rule, and I trust SRP will carefully con-
fine its activities regarding the Robe-
son appearance to the campus of the
University.

Sincerely yours,
Wm. Birenbaum

“ROB ROY”

MAROON betrays

I noted with amusement the “scien-
tific’’ survey, reported in today’s (April
30) MAROON, and especially the fol-
lowing statement:

“If a good deal of space is devoted to
items of a political nature there is a
quantity of evidence that this is appre-
ciated by a student body which is wide
awake to political realities and which
shows a broad and healthy Interest in
political affairs.” (page 12)

Compare the following "salient” point,
given in the editor’s column, page 4,
same issue:

“The majority of the campus Is not
interested enough in student politics to
bother voting. The total number was
quite low. 25.7 per cent of the eligible
voters cast ballot ...”

Would the editor care to comment on
this curious contradiction? Also, why
was no- mention made in the survey as
to the opinion of MAROON readers
about the "cultural” reviews? I for one
find it difficult not to register any
complaint against the illiterates and In-
sensltives who pollute your "cultural”
pages each Friday. Their Juvenile Marx-
ism is calculated to foster in the minds
of discerning readers the suplcion that
the Chicago MAROON is controlled by
students who discredit the entire uni-
versity community. That your literary
reviewer is incompetent has been no-
torious for months. Your movie review
of "Beat the Devil” struck a new low In
stupidity, even for the MAROON. Many
more examples might be given.

Is It the intention of the editor to de-
stroy the MAROON, or to degrade It to
the same childish level as is manifested
In the "political” machinations of part-
ies supported by one one-fourth of the
student body? If this disgraceful situa-
tion Is not corrected, the editor will
have betrayed the newspaper and the
community.

THE CHICAGO REVIEW

Acrodeo, presented in Man-
del hall last weekend, revealed
that Acrotheatre has main-
tained its high standards of talent
and technical excellence. But the
presentation of these glittering
wares in the Jaded form of a vari-
ety show was disappointing to
those who have enjoyed Acrothea-
tre in such performances as The
Magic Rope.

This show was heavy on dance
numbers. In general, the perform-
ance was excellent, while choreog-
raphy ranged from brilliance to
inanity.

Brilliance was there in Mrs.
Dolores Wharton’s Sunset, a short
ballet showing strongly the influ-

What makes
a Lucky
taste better?

ence of the Martha Graham mod-
ern dance school. Mrs. Wharton’s
performance as a dancer was
superb, and the chorus did re-
markably well. Its general excel-
lence was enhanced by choreog-
raphy that considered the capabili-
ties and limitations of the group,
a precaution too often lacking in
student dance production.

In acrobatic-adagio, a dance
idiom unique to Acrotheatre, the
group is the best in Acrotheatre’s
history. The adagio choreography
was not very interesting, except
for a marvelous burlesque on
tourists by Aero director Bud
Beyer and adagio choreographer
Louise Fechheimer in Los Turis-
tas.

Folk dance adaptations were
used effectively. However, these
acts were lost in the show’s pot-
pourri framework, crowded out
by more boisterous acts.

bi the gymnastic routines with
high bar, tumbling, long horse,
and especially trampoline, Acro-
theatre proved its thesis that gym-
nastics need not be a series of dif-
ficult excercises, but indeed an

of drama

art form in its own right.

“Night Life,” a Broadwayish
dance routine, was creditably
danced by Norma Fox, Leah Con-
dit, and Bud Beyer. Miss Fox’s
choreography showed that an am-
ateur with a little imagination can
match a professional at his own
game, but other than this educa-
tional value it had little to offer.

The most spectacular and strik-
ingly beautiful act of the show
was Carolyn Osterberg’s perform-
ance in “The Web,” a sort of
aerial ballet on a vertical rope,
effectively suspended over the
front rows of the audience. An in-
teresting and technically difficult
hand-balancing duet by Carl An-
dre and Tom Elkins added to the

spectacle of the show.

The best example of Acro-
theatre’s potentials as a dramatic
form was the jugglers’ market-
place scene. The skills of a re-
markable troupe of jugglers
complemented a parody on a
tourist’s souvenir-hunt by Philip
Cohen. Ronald Graham, as a
shrewd fruit peddler with an un-
usual ability to keep large quan-

The performance of "The Vi-
sion of Ariel" and "L'Heure
Espagnole," operas by Saminsky
and Ravel, was erroneously an-
nounced for last Sunday; they will
be given this Sunday at 8:15 p.m.
in Mandel Hall. Student tickets
ore available at 50 cents.

Also, due to a print shop error,
last week's review of the New Art
Wind Quintet, headed "Audience
suffers through Schoenberg," was
not signed; it was written by Rob-
ert Bloch.

titles of his wares airborne, de-
serves special mention.

It is to be hoped that in the fu-
ture Acrotheatre will return to the
dramatic medium of its earlier
shows. Presenting a variety show,
they outdo most amateurs, but
will always be topped by commer-
cial producers with smaller imag-
inations and larger budgets. When
the unique talents of the Acro-
theatre people are used in drama-
tic devices, furthering the develop-
ment of a story that is more than
a creaky skeleton to hang acts on,
the effect is memorable. With this
type of approach, Acrotheatre be-
comes an art form of great power.
It is art, not spectacle, that has
placed Acrotheatre in a position
of eminence in the past—and may
return it there in the future.

Varsity trackmen triumph,

avenge last yearns defeats

Defying Horace Greeley’s advice to go west, the young men
of the varsity track team invaded the campuses of DePauw
University and Wabash College in Indiana last weekend and
came away with impressive victories in both contests. Friday
it was Chicago 71, DePauw 60; Saturday the final score was
Chicago 72 2/3, Wabash 58 1/3.

Ken Stapley . . .

. . . i(S one of the fleet-footed run-
ners on Coach Ted Haydon’s
squad. Against Wabash Saturday
he ran the fastest 440 of his ca-
reer, finishing in :50.0 seconds.
Stapley was the first recipient of
the University’s first post-Hutch-
ins athletic scholarship in 1951.

Nobody would have guessed
that Frank Loomos was run-
ning with less than 24 hours’
rest against Wabash as he roared
to a :10.0 clocking in the 100 yd.
dash, a fast :22.6 in the 220, and
then came from behind to steal
the low hurdles in :25.0.

Higdon wins two miles

Art Qmohundro sped through a
4:32.5 mile, also his best perform-
ance. Hal Higdon, apparently not
satisfied with victories in the mile
and 880 against DePauw on Fri-
day, came back on Saturday to
win the 880 again and pick up a
second in the mile.

Highlights of the Friday meet
included a 43' 10" effort by Joe
Howard in the shot put and Paul
Baptist’s tie for first in the pole
vault. In the high hurdles, Justin
Johnson ran the best timber race
of his short career to tie Coach

Ted Haydon’s best personal time
in this event, :15.1, and upset the
DePauw ace hurler.

Last week’s victories were par-
ticularly significant in that the
Chicago cindermen were able to
avenge their losses to both teams
last year and at the same lime ex-
tend their winning streak in dual
meet competition to six straight in
outdoor competition. The varsity
speedsters have not been defeated
in a dual meet since Marquette
University humbled them last
January.

Watkins, JV
victors again

Mitch Watkins, iron man of the
JV track team, continued to domi-

nate the scene as the lightweight
cindermen rolled over Mt. Carmel
last Thursday and Wheaton
Academy Tuesday. Watkins scor-
ed 2314 points the first day, 2514
at the following meet. Final scores
were Chicago 88, Mt. Carmel 25;
Chicago 83%, Wheaton 3014.

A stiff wind blew up the
straightaway throughout the
Tuesday contest, slowing running
speeds. Watkins scored five first
places, both hurdles, both jumps,
and the discus. .

Against Mt. Carmel, the junior
Maroons took eleven firsts in 13
events.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

May 7, 1954

f--Sports Briefs-----------
Golfers get first victory,
also lose close contest

UC drubbed in three games,
but downs Lake Forest, 5*2

The weather may have been cold, but the Maroon golfers were
hot Tuesday when they defeated Navy Pier, 12-6. Walt Bison paced
the golfers in their first win of the season with a 76.

The only perfect thing about Chicago’s previous contest was the
weather. On Saturday—the day before Indian Winter—Northern
Illinois Teachers rolled across the fairways of DeKalb golf course
to hand the Maroons a 25-2 defeat. Bison was low scorer with 75.

Last Friday Harvard High School defeated the junior varsity golf-
ers, 8-4, on the Jackson Park fairways.

Sailors lose in qualifying meet

Wisconsin and Marquette beat out four other teams at Columbia
Yacht Club last weekend to qualify for the Midwest Championship
Regatta. Northwestern was runner-up, followed by Chicago, Wash-
ington and IIT. Despite perfect weather, the UC team, led by skippers
Bob Baron and Ellis McClenachan, was unable to capture a top berth.

Varsity netmen win one, drop one

Notre Dame shut-out the Maroon netmen Wednesday, 9-0, in South
• Bend, but Aurora College received the full treatment from the var-
sity “B” team as the netmen pounded a 6-1 victory on the varsity
courts last Thursday.

The following day the JV netmen slammed and smashed their way
to a shflt-out victory over Luther South. 4-0.

Sports events this week

Tomorrow—the varsity tennis team meets Beloit at 2 p.m. on the
varsity courts. Monday—the JV traekmen face Hyde Park High in
Stagg Field at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday—the baseball team plays Chicago
Teachers at Stagg Field at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday—again tennis against
Beloit, same time, same place. Thursday—baseball against Navy Pier,
3:30 p.m. in Stagg Field.

Washington
wins twin-bill

A well-rounded Washington nine
trounced Chicago, 12-4 and 14-3, in
a Staff field twin bill Saturday.
Under brilliant pitching, Wash-
ington of St. Louis won its tenth
and eleventh games in a row and
recorded its fourteenth victory
against a single loss this season.

The polished St. Louis squad
was probably the best team the
Maroons faced this year. On the
basis of a two-hit win over Lake'
Forest, Buzz Tarr started for the
Maroons in the opener. N.j field
and little hit were responsf' le for
his loss.

John Bronte'S took the mound
in the nightcap, and plagued by
the first game’s woes, lost in the
deluge.

Washington 311 031 003—12 11 3
Maroons .040	000 000— 4 4 4

Washington .. 600 105 2—14 12 0
Chicago...000 201 0— 3 3 5

Finally—a win!

Two triples by Bob Mann and
two double-steals paced the Ma-
roons to a 5-2 victory over Lake
Forest yesterday. Jerry Boh-
man went the route for his first
win.

Bob Mann ... a star basketball
player as well as the mainstay on
the Maroon nine, who hit his sec-
ond home-run last Saturday.

Pier lllini
tip Maroons

It wasn’t baseball weather
Wednesday at Stagg Field, but
the Maroons and Navy Pier tried.
After an afternoon that was a
batter’s paradise — each team
whacked 13 hits — the UC nine
found themselves on the short end
of a 7-6 score.

Buzz Tarr started for the Ma-
roons and helped his own cause
in the third inning by dashing
home from second base when the
Pier pitcher, trying to pick him
off, threw the ball into center-
field. •

A flurry of hits in the fourth
scored two runs, and successive
safeties coupled with lllini errors
brou 'hi across more in later in-
nings. But the game was deckled
in the eighth when Don Burns, the
Pier third-baseman, homered to
clinch the game. Longest Maroon
blow of the day was Jerry Cou-
ture’s fourth inning triple.
