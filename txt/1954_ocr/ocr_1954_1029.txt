SG elects Fortier president;
by-law amendment adopted

New officer’s for the 1954-55 Student Government were the principal item of business for
the first meeting of the new SG assembly last Tuesday.

Al Fortier (ISL-col) was elected president of SG. Other officers elected were Emil John-

Writedns illegal,
eight ballots void

A major controversy in the re- Asked why he didn’t petition
cent Student Government elec- and register as an official candi-

son (ISL-col), vice-president; Sabina Wagner (ISL-col), secretary; and Pat Parker (ISL-
bus), treasurer.

An amendment to the SG by-laws was adopted which provides that any party receiving
25 per cent of the total vote in
an SG election and holding a
seat in the assembly is entitled
to a committee-at-large, and thuS
to a representative on the SG ex-
ecutive council. This gives the
Student Representative party a
seat on the council, which it would
not otherwise have had.

The former by-law provided that
any party with 20 per cent of the
seats in SG was entitled to a com-
mittee-at-large. Clark Kucheman
(ISL-FTS) proposed an amend-
ment whereby this requirement
could be waived by a two-thirds
vote of the assembly. ,

tions centered around the three
seats in the Medical school. Al-
though three positions were open
to Med school candidates, SRP
ran none, and ISL had only two.

After the ballots were counted
it was reported that eight of the
Med school ballots had been
counted as void because each had
the name of Fred Solomon writ-
ten in. Solomon thereupon con-
tested the ruling that the ballots
were invalid and asked for the
rule which governed write-ins.

The rule governing write-ins,
according to Jim Handler, chair-
man of the SG election and rules
committee, is as follows: “Any
writing on a ballot shall render
the ballot void.” This rule is in-
terpreted by the E and R commit-
tee to cover any and all writing.

Anderson wants UC support:

ISL wins election

tells why Douglas did not get here

Douglas Anderson, Senator Douglas’ Illinois representative, denied
categorically that he had ever spurned the support of the Independent

date, Solomon replied:

“For personal reasons I did not
know until late last week that I
could spend any time in Student
Government.

“In this context,” he added,
“writing means extraneous re-
marks, defamatory remarks after
a candidate’s name, and the like.
It does not mean ‘no write-in votes
allowed.’ I assumed a democratic
election would allow a voter to
vote for candidates of his choice,
whether or not their names ap-
peared on the ballot.”

At the Student Government
meeting last Tuesday, Jerry
Zisook moved that Solomon be
seated as the third Med school
delegate. Eli Stein immediately
challenged that the motion was
out of order and suggested that
the ruling could be brought up in
Student - Faculty - Administration
court. The motion was declared
out of order by the chair.

Award Fulbright
to Towle at last

in 42 seat landslide

voters of Illinois and groups at the University of Chicago.

Anderson maintained that the only reason that Douglas was unable
to appear on campus was that Douglas had previously scheduled meet-
ings with the IVI in the fifth, second, and seventh wards that same

For the first time in Student Government history a political
party captured all but three seats, as the Independent Students
League won 42 of 45 contested positions in the all-campus
election last week.

Student Representative party candidates were elected to
fill one position in the college, one in the social sciences divi-

sion, and one in the federated
theological schools. There
were no independent candi-
dates on this year’s slate.

This election, described by Clive
Gray (ISL), last year’s SG presi-
dent, as the “biggest landslide a
party ever had,” gave ISL control
of SG for the sixth time since
ISL’s inception in 1948. •

Two seats in the assembly are
vacant. At the first SG meeting
held last Tuesday, Al Fortier was
elected president, thereby relin-
quishing his seat as a delegate.
The other vacancy is in the med-
ical school, where only two of
three seats were filled. SRP had
no candidates in this division.

Approximately 32 per cent of
the total student body cast about
fifteen hundred ballots. This vote
is 4% less than the 36% that
voted in last year’s election, and
5% less than the record vote of
37% in 1952. Three schools were
uncontested, and had a very light

vote this year.

ISL candidates received 62.2%
and SRP candidates 37.8% of the
total votes cast for individual can-
didates.

In the following tabulation of
the election results by divisions
and schools, winning candidates

night. Douglas, he said, “was
eager to speak on the campus if
an open date could be arranged.”
Ralph Fertig, who maintains
that Anderson had made the con-
troversial statements in a tele-
phone talk with him, agreed that
this was the reason that Douglas
could nut appear.

Anderson called it inconceivable
that he could have made such re-
marks. He said he was a founder
of the Americans for Democratic
Action and had worked on ar-
rangements that were to unite the

IVI with the ADA.

Anderson said that Fertig had
“gone off on his own hook” mak-
ing arrangements for speakers on
the strength of Douglas’ name be-
fore final arrangements had been
made with Anderson.

Fertig and John Gilmore, who
made calls to Barratt O'Hara,
Democratic incumbent from the
second Congressional district, and
other notables scheduled to ap-
pear at the rally, denied Ander-
son's allegation.

Dr. Charlotte Towle, who
was denied a Fulbright schol-
arship by the foreign scholar-
ship board in Washington in Sep-
tember of this year, has been
granted the Fulbright upon re-
consideration of the board. Pro-
fessor Towle will lecture on gen-
eric social case work at the Lon-
don School of Economics, starting
in January.

Dr. Towle, professor of social
service administration at UC, is
believed to have been originally
denied the Fulbright because she
urged clemency for the Rosen-
bergs and because she belonged
to an organization advocating aid
to the Spanish loyalists.

University debate team tie for first

The Purdue Invitational Debate tournament last weekend ended in a three-way tie for
first place between teams of Wake Forest, Notre Dame, and UC. Each of these teams had
a record of six victories and two defeats on the basis of a point scoring system. However,
the tie was broken in favor of Wake Forest, with Notre Dame second and Chicago third.

Debating the topic: “Resolved: that the United States should extend diplomatic recogni-
tion to the Communist government of China,” the UC Student Forum affirmative team of
Don McClintock and Roger

debates, the only affirmative

team to do so. Their victims were
Michigan State, Illinois, Boston,
and Notre Dame.

For the negative, UC debaters
Joe Engel and Edward Renshaw
defeated Pittsburgh and the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, and lost to
Indiana and Southern Illinois. In
the final round, the judge, in vio-
lation of tournament tradition, al-
lowed the decision to be made by
a Purdue girls’ speech class who
witnessed the debate. The girls
voted 15 to 13 for the opposition.

The score sheet of the judge
had indicated a tie, a situation in
which the verdict ordinarily goes
to tile negative, since the affirma-
tive bears the burden of proof and
is bound to demonstrate some ad-
vantage for its side.

“The success of Chicago in the
16-team tourney was based upon
its previous analysis of the ques-
tion rather than on speaking
skill,” stated Marv Phillips, For-
um director. “Many of the issues
which the team had rejected as
indefensible in their preparation
for the meet were found to be the
basis of opposition arguments.
Our prior determination of the

weaknesses in these arguments
gave the UC team a considerable
■advantage.

“It appeared,” he added, “that
most of the other teams had built
cases upon shades of meaning in
the topic itself, intending to sur-
prise their opponents, rather than
upon real life attitudes on the
question. Since most teams an-
ticipated such tactics the element

of surprise lay solely with the
Chicago team which had followed
the latter course.”

The next tournament Chicago
will attend is to be held at Brand-
ley on November 19. In the mean-
time debates with the larger col-
leges are being schduled on the
UC campus to give the student
body an opportunity to see the de-
bate team.

the cigarette of fine tobacco . . . and “It’s Toasted’*

Berlin U denies
LAK statements

A rebuttal of Lawrence A.
Kimpton’s statement criticiz-
ing the Free University of
Berlin which appeared in last
week’s Maroon was issued
Wednesday by professor Hirsch,
the Free University’s president.

Hirsch came to the UC campus
as part of his visit to this coun-
try for the Bi-centennial celebra-
tion of Columbia university.

Hirsch was puzzled by Kimp-
ton’s statement that an “air of
fright” surrounds the Free uni-
versity. "There is no such ‘fright’
surrounding the university,”
Hirsch commented, “and as to the
endless checking of passports to
which Mr. Kimpton referred, pass-
poets are checked only when you
enter the country and when you
leave.”

“The Free university has devel-
oped by leaps and bounds,” he
commented. It now has an ex-
change program with Stanford
and Columbia for professors and
witii Stanford, Columbia, and
Harvard for students; the Free
university was the first German
university to give extension
courses at night.

The needs of a new university
are very large, stated Hirsch, and
some are impossible to supply; a
great deal of help, however, has
come from the US through the
Ford and Rockefeller foundations
and the State department.

Hirsch said that 40% of the
Free university’s students origin-
ally came from the Soviet zone of
Berlin, and a few commute regu-
larly between the Soviet zone and
the university.

Mead says tolerance
forced on Protestants

“Religious toleration was universal in the English colonies
by the middle of the 18th century, but Protestantism did not
contribute to this religious liberty. It was forced into it,” con-

cluded Sidney E. Mead, asso-
ciate professor of history of
American Christianity.

Mead spoke in the first of a
series of four Walgreen founda-
tion lectures on “The shape of
Protestantism in America,” last
Monday. This first lecture, “From
coercion to persuasion,” dealt
with the development of relig-
ious toleration in early colonial
America.

Mead pointed out that early
Protestant aims to establish re-
ligious coercion in the new world
were frustrated by a variety of
outside influences. The self-inter-
est of individuals caused them to
forget the cries of the church
when it interfered with their per-
sonal ambitions; the vast spaces
of the new land made banishment
an enlargement of opportunity
rather than a confinement; and
England exerted pressure for a
more tolerant attitude on relig-
ious matters in New England.

Besides these influences, “a
strange alliance developed be-
tween the rationalists and the
pietist revivalists which fore-
warded the cause of religious

C'shop drops all
hoars after five

C-shop hours have again been
limited to 7:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Lack of
student support was given by Rob-
ert M. Strozier, dean of students,
as the reason for the scheduling
of no evening hours this year.

Strozier said the C-shop, located
off Mandel corridor near the Com-
mons, lost too much money last
spring to allow it to continue to
remain open after 5.

Evening hours have lost money
since they were originated in Jan-
uary of 1952 explained Mrs. Alma
Baugh, supervisor of Hutchinson
commons.

Patronage dwindled during last
year, and by the spring quarter
the shop was losing too much
money for the administration to
continue to underwrite the loss.

freedom,” Mead said. This alli-
ance was purely practical and not
theoretical. The rationalist ap-
proach to religious freedom, based
on the intellectual conception that
all religions good enough to pre-
serve peace and order have a
right to exist, could not be recon-
ciled with that of the revivalists
who, while having no interest in
conformity, had no intellectual in-
terest in anything.

Nevertheless, Mead continued,
this alliance, combined with the
earlier factors of self-interest,
vast spaces, and pressure from
the old world, brought American
Protestantism—-in spite of itself —
still further down the road toward
religious toleration.

Editorial

MAROON prints all news

For quite a while now it has become less fashionable to
revile the Maroon for faults which range from a mere vicious
slanting of one story to hatching of vast conspiracies designed
to subvert the government (SG, of course).

So we are sorry to note that once again we have to defend ourselves
for doing something which it is our duty and our stated purpose to
do: provide an unbiased coverage for all the news in an unbiased
fashion, no matter how much the content or what we write might
please or displease us.

We refer here to the story about Senator Paul H. Douglas which
appeared in the last issue of our paper. We are told that this story
is detrimental to the cause of the senator’s re-election.

We might remind our critics that the Maroon has not declared
itself either for or against Douglas, that even if we were supporting
the senator editorially, the practice of printing or suppressing news
in line with orfe’s editorial policy i§ more suited to certain Chicago
metropolitan papers than to ourselves. If the facts printed in the story
are the truth, then it is the actions of the persons involved that do,
or do not, reflect upon the various personalities.

We still propose to print all the news which we believe to be of
interest to the student body. If this means stepping on the toes of
particular interests, then we can only hope that the bones involved
are sound enough to stand it.

from the Democratic and Republican
parties. In many cases, candidates and
their friends put tremendous pressures
on members of our Board of Directors
in an attempt to Influence them. (You
can be sure such pressures had no ef-
fect.) Never has the IVI endorsement
been so eagerly sought as this year.
Many candidates told us frankly that
if the usual close county vote prevails
the IVI endorsement will determine the
outcome of several county races.

Not only did Joseph Meek and Sena-
tor Douglas eagerly seek the IVI en-
dorsement, but Senator Douglas has
given full cooperation to our various
district campaign committees. He has
gone out of his way to appear at some
of our public meetings. (Last February
he flew from Washington to appear
with Adlai Stevenson and Arch Carey
at our 10th anniversary celebration.

And our members have enthusias-
tically supported Senator Douglas be-
cause^ of his intelligence and devotion,
because of his great fights on off-shore
oil, his selfless attempts to wake up
Americans to the need for economic plan-
ning to avert depression, and his strong
support of the UN and economic aid to
underdeveloped areas. It is a great rec-
ord.

We hope that students, faculty and
all others associated with your great
university will go on giving support to
America’s Number One Senator, just as
they have in the past.

James V. Cunningham. Jr.

Executive Director I.V.I.

agreed to fly in from Detroit for the
occasion and speak for the candidates.
Mr. Cass initiated arrangements for
procuring the Field House, and had re-
ceived the consent of the proper admin-
istration personnel.

Before submitting a story on the
meeting to the MAROON, on Wednes-
day, Oct. 13, I again checked with Miss
Malone at the Democratic Party. She
assured me that all publicity could be
issued. That evening Mr. Anderson got
in touch with me. He Informed me that
the Democratic Party officials had made
an honest and innocent mistake in
scheduling Douglas for our proposed
gathering. The Democratic Party, he ex-
plained, has priority over all other
appointments, but this priority can only
be utilized for Its ward meetings, and
could not be extended to other groups
such as ours. Mr. Anderson then made
those statements which have formed
the basis of controversy on last Friday’s
article.

I cancelled the MAROON story which
announced our proposed Mass Meeting,
and, in so doing, urged the editors of
the MAROON to pursue the matter no
further. Nothing appeared that week.
The following week, I was Interviewed
for the story. By then, rumors and re-
porters had it that the remarks deroga-
tory to UC and to IVI were the Senator’s
and not those of his assistant. I urged
the MAROON to make It clear that there
was no reason to believe that the stated
positions were those of Mr. Douglas.
There is still no evidence of the Sena-
tor’s holding such beliefs on the matter,

and his welcoming of IVI support in the
precincts and in his remarks at meet-
ings would tend to indicate a difference
of opinion.

Mr. Anderson has subsequently issued
Identical remarks to a women connected
with the IVI on the North Side. This
woman reported the comments to the
Political Action Personnel of the IVI
IVI has had the good sense to discuss
this problem of a highly paced advisor
rejecting the support of liberals rather
than denouncing those who report such
discouraging remarks.

SFD protests article

In last week’s issue of the Maroon
there appeared an article entitled
•'Douglas Cancels Rally Date.’’ The in-
accuracies in the article were so fla-
grantly shocking that we. the Executive
Committee of Students for Douglas,
would like to set the record straight.

First, the article states that a mass
rally had been “scheduled on campus
for Monday evening, October 18,” at
which Senator Douglas and other no-
tables were to appear. No such meeting
had ever been screduled by Students for
Douglas. The Mr. Fertig that you men-
tioned is not and never has been a
member of our organization.

The article went on to say that “the
director of the Speakers Bureau of the
Democratic Party in Cook County had
told members of the Students for Doug-
las organization on campus to go ahead
with publicity on Douglas’ appearance.”
No member of Students for Douglas ever
spoke with the Speakers Bureau. We
have had no contact with them, what-
soever.

The article called Mr. Douglas Ander-
son the “administrative assistant to
Douglas.” Mr. Anderson does not and
never has held this position. Mr. Ander-
son is the Illinois representative of the
Senator.

The article attributed to Mr. Anderson,
the statement “Campaigning at the Uni-
versity of Chicago is the kiss of death”
and further stated that “he expressed
the wish that people at the University
and the Independent Voters of Illinois,
would not endorse Douglas,” allegedly
because the Senator wished to disasso-
ciate himself from their “.radical poli-
tical elements.”

Mr. Andrson has assured us that he
has never made such a statement to
any person, and that they are not his
views. We can assure you that he has
never made such a statement to Stu-
dents for Douglas. Anyone who knows
the Senator and is familiar with his
record knows that they are not the views
of Senator Douglas. All one need do is
pick up a phone and call Mr. Anderson
(as we did upon seeing the article), to
confirm this.

Senator Douglas has spoken in this
campaign before numerous IVI meetings
and has the whole-hearted support of
that organization. Only a week ago
Tuesday he addressed an IVI meeting
at their Hyde Park headquarters at 1412
E. 55th Street.

The Senator has always been proud
of his more than 26 year association
with the University of Chicago, and
has openly welcomed the support of
its students and faculty, many of whom
are now actively campaigning for his
re-election.

This past Monday a representative of
Douglas* campaign headquarters appear-
ed at a Students for Douglas meeting
on campus to enlist the service of stu-
dents as poll-watchers, etc. The Sena-
tor’s wife, Mrs. Emily Taft Douglas,
former Congresswoman - at - large from
Illinois spoke on campus this past Tues-
day at another Students-for-Douglas
sponsored meeting. Pick up any one of
the numerous campaign pamphlets put
out by Douglas’ campaign headquarters
and you will discover what prominence
the Senator’s long tenure at the U. of
C. is given. Are these the ways one
goes about “disassociating Douglas”
name from the University?

Summing up: the entire article In last
week’s Maroon was from beginning to
end a long list of prevarications, some
of which, for the sake of conserving
space, we have even neglected to men-
tion in this letter. The atricle was not
submitted by Students for Douglas, or by
any member thereof. Students for Doug-
las knew nothing about the article until
the Maroon published it. We are at a
loss to know why the name of our or-
ganization was mentioned in the article.
It sounded as though inspired and writ-
ten by a “Student for Meek.”

IVI supports Douglas

We read with considerable Inter* st
your story about the cancellation of
Senator Douglas’ campus appearance,
and particularly the paragraph dealing
with a statement by Mr. Douglas Ander-
son, who heads the Senator’s Chicago
office, in which Mr. Anderson is quoted
as saying the Senator would get more
votes without the endorsement of the
Independent Voters of Illinois than he
will with it.

If Mr. Anderson said these words, you
can be sure he was not speaking for
the Senator, and he was talking non-
sense. A few facts make this clear.

Both Joseph Meek and Senator Doug-
las actively sought the endorsement of
the IVI, as did ninety other candidates

Editor’s note: The story, ap-

was written from information
supplied by Ralph Fertig, at that
time, chairman of the citizen’s
committee for Barrett O’Hara.
Douglas Anderson was not avail-
able for comment up to the time
of publication.

The Maroon apologizes that this
was not made clear in the story or
headline as printed. For Fertig’s
comments on the story read be-
low.

Our apologies also go to Frank
McCulloch, Senator Douglas’ ad-
ministrative assistant, whose title
was given to Douglas Anderson,
the senator’s Illinois representa-
tive.

Student explains
Douglas story

A great deal of confusion and concern
has been called to my attention with
reference to last week’s MAROON article
on the abandoned Mass Meeting for
Senator Douglas. While we who are en-
gaged in electioneering may doubt the
practical advantage of such a story —
and I had grave misgiving’s about its
appearance — the story was thoroughly
accurate in its detail.

It is a sad commentary on Liberals
that so many are prepared to throw to
the winds freedom of the press when it
ill suits a liberal candidate to have a
story featured on him which is other-
wise relevant to the paper’s readership.
The continued attacks upon the Integ-
rity of my co-workers in the campaign
for Douglas, O’Hara, and Lohman com-
pel me to explain in greater detail the
entire situation which led up to the
printing of last Friday’s story.

After a conference with Director of
Student Activities, William Birenbaum.
held Tuesday, October 12, the Chairman
of Students for Douglas, Don Cass, and
I, speaking for the Committee for Bar-
ratt O’Hara agreed to co-sponsor the two
candidates with other big name speakers
at a Mass Meeting for the campus. Mr.
Cass agreed to make arrangements for
a location, and I was to contact Douglas
and O’Hara. Mr. Douglas and his admin-
istrative assistant, Mr. Anderson, were
both out of town. I was informed by
their office that the Democratic party
also schedules Douglas, and so I con-
tacted the appropriate personnel there.
Miss Jerry Malone, head of the Speakers
Bureau at the Democratic Party Head-
quarters assured me we could have
Douglas for Monday evening, October 18.
Barratt O’Hara arranged his schedule for
that same evening, and Mr. Emil Mazey,
Secretary-Treasurer of the UAW-CIO

Support McCarthy censure

The campus Robin Hood club last week initiated its pro-
gram of support for the McCarthy censure, as recommended
bv the Senate Watkins subcommittee.

"The Robin Hood club was ac-
tivated on this issue,” said Suz-
anne Friedmann, Robin Hood sec-
retary, “because of our concern
with the formation of the ‘national
rally for Joe McCarthy’ sched-
uled for November 11, and
nfter the Senate convenes to con-
because of the large response to

the rally.”

The Robin Hood projects in-
clude soap and baggage tag cam-
paign, consisting of hotel-size
bars of soap wired to baggage
tags which are stamped, “Don’t
Whitewash McCarthy—Vote Cen-
sure.”

Long-time friend
of UC succumbs
in tragic death

The death-bell tolled last
week as a silent band of cut-
ters armed with saws and
ladders beheaded UC’s friend of
long standing — the ad-covered
tree in front of Woodworth’s
bookstore.

At 9:30 a.m. on Oct. 19 the tree’s
branches creaked their last and
fell to the ground, temporarily
blocking 57th street traffic un-
til the branches could be hewn
and carted away to their final
resting place.

The move was made to avert
the imminent collapse of the late
ly decayed tree upon Woodworth’s
during anticipated winter wind-
storms.

The tree was decapitated, rath-
er than cut down entirely, public
opinion deeming that the ad-cov-
ered trunk should stand. The
trunk, too, will be gone within
three years. It is now completely
dead, and bark will begin to drop
off during the coming year.

When no new branches ap-
peared last spring, the tree was
diagnosed as dead; cause of death:
thirst.

Having grown in its late loca-
tion since 1893, the tree enjoyed a

world wide reputation and has
been granted coverage in such
publications as International
News report. Life, the Christian
Science Monitor, and Time.

Paul Douglas' wife describes
programs;.attacks administration

Congress “should act like the good doctor — see the symp-
toms, diagnose, and cure the economic pneumonia. Acts, not
words, achieve results in economics.” So Senator Paul Doug-

las’ economic program was
described by his wife, Emily
Taft Douglas, in a speech at a
Students for Douglas meeting
Tuesday afternoon.

Senator Douglas, she said, be-
lieves that “this administration
has been obtuse about human wel-
fare.” Several issues she men-
tioned as mismanaged included
housing and tidelands oil.

There is a need for more public
housing; the housing bill writ-
ten in 1939 by Senator Douglas
and another senator has had its

Illness postpones
Spencer lectures

The recent illness of William H.
Spencer, distinguished service
professor emeritus of the school
of business, has postponed the
opening of the University college
distinguished service lecture se-
ries from October 29 to Novem-
ber 26.

Eugene M. K. Geiling, distin-
guished service professor of phar-
macology, will speak on “the im-
pact of the atomic age on bio-
chemical research” on November
26 in the Woodrow Wilson room,
116 S. Michigan avenue, for the
University college.

provisions for homes cut by two-
thirds, she stated. More schools,
as well as more houses, are
needed.

Senator Douglas “wanted nat-
ural resources to help the human
resources,” proposing that tide-
lands oil wealth be used for edu-
cation “to light the lamp of knowl-
edge”; off-shore oil was instead
granted to four states.

During the question and answer
period, Mrs. Douglas was queried
as to her husband’s voting in fa-
vor of outlawing the Communist
party. She answered that her hus-
band felt that “to belong to the
Communist party is to belong to
an active conspiracy to overthrow
the government. It is a direct
threat.”

Hard times
party tonight

Psi Upsilon’s traditional hard

win’s band will furnish musi-
cal entertainment.

All students are invited, with
or without dates. There is no
admission, but visitors must
wear hard-times costumes, said
the fraternity.

Mr. Spencer’s lecture on “Re-
cent trends in the relationship be-

tween government and business”
will close the series in April.

Approval deadline
set for special
honors applicants

The deadline for approval of
special honor proposals in the
college has been set for Janu-
ary 7.

All students wishing to be grad-
uated with special honors in any
area of the college should con-
sult with the chairman of the
staff in which they wish to do
special honors work, John P.
Netherton, assistant dean in the
college, said this week.

The prerequisites for admit-
tance to the special honors pro-
gram is a B average with no
grade lower than a C. An essay
is usually required to satisfy the
departmental requirements for
special honors. The requirements
may vary slightly from staff to
staff, however.

The honors, if achieved, will ap-
pear on the convocation listings
and as a part of the student’s per-
manent transcript.

Over 120 students have taken
the honors program since it was
first initiated in 1947, according
to Netherton.

Appleton and Field concert
interesting but not outstanding

A program of two-piano music fs not usually a thrilling pros-
pect, and it must be admitted that the first University concert
last Friday, a recital by Vera Appleton and Michael Field, was
considerably more interesting than one would expect.

Their rendition of Brahms’ Variations on a Theme by Haydn
(better known in its subsequent orchestral version), after a

rather shaky start exhibited
some fine and sententious
playing, albeit with frequent
yubatos.

Stravinsky’s Concerto for Two
Pianos Without Accompaniment,
which followed, was flashily and
noisily performed; it uses the in-
struments almost entirely percus-
sively. with the usual “clashing
harmonies and biting rhythms’’ of
the composer’s later style. The
first movement is a rather effec-
tive display piece, but the tepid
and aimless slow movement and
the rcpe.titive third became very
tiresome with their unpianistic
conception.

Although the Bartok pieces
from Mikrokosmos were particu-
larly well done, the high point of
the recital was, curiously, n o t
originally written for two pianos,
not was it on the printed program.

Even considering the limita-
tions of the literature, one would

have preferred hearing fewer pi-
ano versions of orchestra pieces.
The 19th - century - style arrange-
ment of a Bach chorale prelude
which served as an encore rather
accentuated this impression.

This was a remarkable arrange-
ment of Debussy's Fetes by Mau-
rice Ravel, which the duo played
with much spirit and feeling, al-
though it could hardly replace the
orchestral version. Ravel’s own
Feria was considerably less effec-
tive.

'La Ronde' tricky trifle

Nature, working through the cold and inscrutable judgment of a film booker, has presented during
the past week at the Hyde Park theatre an almost perfectly controlled cinematic experiment.

Max Ophuls’ La Ronde and Thorold Dickinson’s Gaslight are both adapted from plays. Both are ap-
proximajfcely the same magnitude in significance: Gaslight is based bn frankly melodramatic prem-
ises, while La Ronde is from Schnitzler’s tracky psychological trifle.

They differ simply in that La Ronde is a distressingly poor film while Gaslight is a work of consum-

mate craftmanship.

The problem of understanding
why one film is a .failure and the
other is not, in this case, resolves
itself into seeing what character-
istic stylistic elements, what ap-
proach to subject matter and the
film medium each director has
utilized.

Ophuls doomed himself to al-
most certain failure by the use of
devices that just never seem to be
convincing on the screen.

Chief among there was the use
of a “Mr. Fate” character to fur-
ther the action. And it wasn’t
merely the off-key- singing and
horrendous posturing of Mr. Wal-
brook that caused this.

Placement of the action in the
context of a stage-filmic-historical
never-never-land betrays the most
fundamental principle of convinc-
ing cinema.

The basis for Dickinson’s style
lies in the realization that any
characters or devices interposed
between direct visual presentation
of the action tend to destroy the
unity and rhythm of the film.

Dickinson is a master of using
objects in a way that illuminates
and interacts with the world of
character and action.

In the opening sequence, the
slashed furniture a demented
murderer leaves in the wake of
his search reflects the chaos of
his mind, the frenzy of his action,
and the condition of his victim,
now dying as just such a bundle
of useless rubbish.

Again in the flickering of the

gaslight as the husband leaves the
attic we feel the emotional flut-
tering of his wife’s fears, doubts
and anguish as she lies on hei' bed.
In themselves trifles, these de-
vices become significant when
they make up the complex seam
less texture of the film. Perhaps
it is this element of not being told
everything, of participating in
more than a passive way, that
sets the difference between good
and poor cinema.

HOME, SWEET HOMECOMING

A great number of people have been asking me lately, “What is
Homecoming?” Yesterday, for example, as I walked from my house
to the establishment of Mr. Sigafoos, the local lepidopterist where
1 had left a half dozen luna moths to be mounted — a distance of no
more than three blocks — 1’11 wager that well over a thousand people
stopped me and said, "What is Homecoming?”

Well, what with company coming for dinner and the cook down
with a recurrence of breakbone fever, I could not tarry to answer
their questions. “Read my column next week,” I cried to them.
“I’ll tell all about Homecoming.” With that I brushed past and
raced home to baste the mallard and apply poultices to the cook,
who, despite my unending ministrations, expired quietly during the
night, a woman in her prime, scarcely 108 years old. Though her
passing grieved me, it was some satisfaction to be able to grant her
last wish — to be buried at sea — which is no small task when you
live in Pierre, South Dakota.

With the dinner guests fed and the cook laid to her watery rest,
I put out the cat and turned to the problem of Homecoming.

First of all, let us define Homecoming. Homecoming is a weekend
when old graduates return to their alma maters to see a football
game, ingest great quantities of food and drink, and inspect each
other's bald spot!#

This occasion is marked by the singing of old songs, the slapping
of old backs, and the frequent utterance of such outcries as “Harry,
you old polecat!” or "Harry, you old rooster!” or "Harry, you old
wombat!” or "Harry, you old mandrill!” All old grads are named
Harry.

During Homecoming the members of the faculty behave with
unaccustomed animation. They laugh and smile and pound backs
and keep shouting, "Harry, you old retriever!” These unscholariy
actions are performed in the hope that the old grads, in a transport
of bonhomie, will endow a new geology building.

The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time on
Saturday, their backs are so sore, their eyes so bleary, and their
livers so sluggish that it is impossible to get a kind word out of
them, much less a new geology building. "Hmphh!” they snort as
the home team completes a 101 yard march to a touchdown. "Call
that football? Why, back in my day they’d have been over on the
first down. By George, football was football back in those days —
not this namby pamby girls game that passes for football today.
Why, look at that bench. Fifty substitutes sitting there! Why, in
my day, there were eleven men on a team and that was it. When you
broke a leg, you got taped up and went right back in. Why, I remem-
ber the big game against State. Harry Wallaby, our star quarter-
back, was killed in the third quarter. I mean he was pronounced dead.
But did that stop old Harry? Not on your tintype! Back in he went
and kicked the winning drop-kick in the last four seconds of play,
dead as he was. Back in my day, they played fool bull, by George!”

Everything, say the old grads, was better back in their day —
everything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the old
grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a smoke like
today’s vintage Philip Morris — never anything so mild and pleasing,
day in day out, at study or at play, in sunshine or in shower, on
grassy bank or musty taproom, afoot or ahorse, at home or abroad,
any time, any weather, anywhere.

I take up next another important aspect of Homecoming — the
decorations in front of the fraternity house. Well do I remember
one Homecoming of my undergraduate days. The game was against
Princeton. The Homecoming slogan was "Hold That Tiger!” Each
fraternity house built a decoration to reflect that slogan, and on
the morning of the game a group of dignitaries toured Fraternity
Row to inspect the decorations and award a prize for the best.

The decoration chairman at our house was an enterprising young
man named Rex Sigafoos, nephew of the famous lepidopterist. Rex
surveyed Fraternity Row, came back to our house and said, "All
the other houses are building cardboard cages with cardboard tigers
inside of them. We need to do something different — and I’ve got it.
We’re going to have a real cage with a real tiger inside of it —a
snarling, clawing, slashing, real live tiger!”

"Crikey!” we breathed. "But where will you get him?”

"I’ll borrow him from the zoo,” said Rex, and sure enough, he did.

Well sir, you can imagine what a sensation it was on Home-
coming morning. The judges drove along nodding politely at card-
board tigers in cardboard cages and suddenly they came to our house.
No sham beast in a sham cage here! No sir! A real tiger in a real
cage — a great striped jungle killer who slashed and roared and
snarled and dashed himself against the bars of his cage with mani-
acal fury.

There can be no doubt that we would have easily taken first prize
had not the tiger knocked out the bars of the cage and leaped into
the official car and devoured Mr. August Schlemmer, the governor
of the state, Mr. Wilson Ardsley Devereaux, president of the uni-
versity, Dr. O. P. Gransmire, author of A Treasury of the World’s
Great Southpaws: An Anthology of Left Hand Literature, Mr.
Harrison J. Teed, commissioner of weights and measures, Mrs. Amy
Dorr Nesbitt, inventor of the clarinet, Mr. Jarrett Thrum, world’s
135 pound lacrosse champion, Mr. Peter Bennett Hough, editor of the
literary quarterly Spasm, and Mrs. Ora Wells Anthony, first woman
to tunnel under the North Platte River.	©Max shuiman, 1954

saved by the Illini goalie.

The second half began auspici-
ously for Chicago. In what was
perhaps the finest solo play of the
year, Godfrey dribbled the ball
forty yards into the Navy Pier
goal.

Chicago elation was shortlived,
however. Fifteen seconds later the
Illini roared down the field, drew
goalie Jerry Czamanske out of
position, and gave Ihor Dachniv-
sky a chance to tap the ball into
the net to event the score. 2-2.

The winning goal came late in
the last quarter when a long, fast
ground ball took a tremendous
