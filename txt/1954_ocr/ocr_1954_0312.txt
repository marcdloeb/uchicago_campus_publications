Magazine salesman arrested;

30 students buy subscriptions

by Warren Roy Spachner

Arrested last Thursday night for alleged fraudulent solicitations of subscriptions to
Newsweek magazine from students in various dormitories was Charles Harris, of the Hayes
Hotel, located at University Avenue and 64th Street. Harris was arrested by John Clifford
of the campus police and turned over to the Hyde Park police. He was booked on open
charges pending investigation and was released on bail.

The usual procedure would have been to prosecute Harris for trespassing, since it is nec-

essary for any non-student
soliciting on campus, to get a
permit from the administra-
tion. When asked about the charg-
es to be preferred against Harris,
the Hyde Park Police refused to
comment.

Trustee speaks
at convocation

David Rockefeller, UC trustee,
will be guest speaker at the win-
ter quarter convocation, to be held
Friday, March 19, in Rockefeller
Chapel.

The subject of Rockefeller’s ad-
dress is unknown at the present
time.

Convocation services, to be held
on the Sunday preceeding the con-
vocation, will be conducted by
Charles W. Gilkey, dean emeritus
of the Chapel and professor emer-
itus of the federated theological
faculty, who will speak on “Life's
Second-bests.”

About 170 students will receive
degrees at the ceremony.

Forum to debate Indian students

by Robert Quinn

The Debate in Progress sign which usually hangs on the door of the Student Forum office will be moved
April 1 at 8 p.m. to Soc. Sci 122 when a debate team from Bombay and Jaipur, India, will compete with a
team of selected UC debaters.

The subject of the debate for which the unusually large turnout is anticipated is''Resolved: Indian Neu-
trality Is Necessary for an

Understanding Between
East and West.” This particu-
lar topic is one of eight which
the Indian team has been dis-
cussing during its Institute of
International Education sponsor-
ed tour qf this country.

The debate will be divided into
three parts. Each member will
be afforded ten minutes in which
to state his arguments support-
ing his team’s position on the
issue. Following this each of the
four participants will be given
five minutes in which to give re-
buttals. The debate will close with
a question and answer session
between the audience and the de-
baters.

Special reduced rates will be offered by the John Stocks
Travel Service to any group of three students going to the
same destination during the interim. Reduction rates will
range from 20 to 25 per cent provided the students will leave

and return together.

The Travel Service is alsJ
offering reduced rates for stu-
dents who plan to go to New York
City. The reduced traveling rates
will be good only if a group of 25
or more take advantage of this
offer. The plan offered stipulates
that the students must be travel-
ing together. However, they may
return individually if they desire
provided that they are back by
April 5.

said, the Code is “not consonant
with this spirit, which is identified
with such academic informality as
non-compulsory class attendance.
“A few fundamental things are
necessary, however,” he contin-
ued, “to define the relations of
campus organizations with each

Strozier said that the founders
of the Student Code had been le-

he continued, “this legalism

relaxed relationship.”

Commenting on the Strozier
proposals, Audrey Galyon, ISL
majority leader, said, “We are al-
ways willing to change the Code,
depending on the changes. The de-
tails of the code protect the rights
of organizations by setting forth
the limits in which they may oper-
ate, and the specific ways and
areas in which the administration
may supervise them.”

Eli Stein, chairman of the Com-
mittee on Recognized Student Ac-
tivities. has submitted a sugges-
tion for revision of the Student
Code to William Birenbaum, direc-
tor of student activities. Stein’s
main suggestion was a proposal to
“make it easier for student organ-

Hinton visions

bright future" for China; Catch partners in crime

cites economic and educational reform

following burglary, forgery

These Chinese people,” stated

William Hinton in a lecture given in Law North last

Friday, “have a healthy confidence in their future.” With an increased standard of living,
recent land reforms and rapid growth of industry, the vast majority of the population
heartily supports its new government, he declared.

Hinton, an agronomist who just returned from six years in China, reported on his experi-
ences and observations in a lecture sponsored by the Student Representative Party. Hinton

Two youthful self-admitted dope addicts who posed as a
University of Chicago student and a Billings Hospital attend-
ant have confessed to a series of burglaries and check forgeries
in the University community. Several Hyde Park merchants
were victimized by the pair.

They were captured last week, when the young man, 21,
was recognized by the clinical

volunteered to go to China as
a tractor instructor and tech-
nician with the United Nations Re-
lief and Rehabilitation Adminis-
tration (UNRRA) in 1947. A few
months after his arrival in the
country the program*was aban-
doned, but he chose to remain for
what he called “a grandstand seat
lor a major historical event.”

Hinton began the lecture by de-
scribing the area he knew best,
which was under Communist con-
trol even before his arrival, a
large state farm in Northern
China where he was employed as
an instructor during most of his
stay. He cited some statistics of
farm living, stating that the stand-
ard of living and leisure hour oc-
cupations at this farm are com-
parable to those of industrial
workers throughout China.

$10 to $15 a month would be an
average wage, with skilled work-
ers getting as high as $50. How-
ever food only costs from $4 to $8
per month, and housing and medi-
cine are usually free, Hinton said.
The working day is eight hours

long, six days a week. On the farm
where Hinton stayed there were
1,200 full time workers, mostly
peasants, students, ex-soldiers and
ex-bank clerks.

Enthusiasm for education great

In this farm, as all over the
country, the enthusiasm for edu-
cation was tremendous, Hinton
declared. “Most people who were
illiterate when joining the farm
learned to read and write within a
year. Almost everyone was study-
ing something at the night school
and even the milking schedule was
altered in order to allow the milk-

ers to attend classes.”

Turning to China’s
life, Hinton remarked
agricultural resources

economic
that her
are tre-

Wealth not

advertising

“Although advertising has been
blamed for causing our cultural
• neurosis, there is no evidence to
support this claim,” declared
George Brown, professor of mar-
keting, in a talk last Friday.

His discussion of “Advertising’s
Contribution to the Cultural Neu-
rosis,” was the first in a series of
Friday afternoon discussions spon-
sored by the Business Club in
Haskell Hall.

Defining cultural neurosis as a
value judgment of the good life
incorporating people's desires to
be “big shots,” Brown contended
that while advertisers might want
to make people culturally neurotic
for a profit, they are unable to
do it. What advertisers do is wait
until they find an area where peo-
ple want to impress their neigh-
bors and then slant their adver-
tising to take advantage of an
existing situation.

“Social scientists in general and
college professors in particular
place too much value on advertis-
ing,” said Brown. Advertising
which is not supported by the so-
ciety cannot be effective. During
the discussion Brown admitted
that advertising might tend to
further this cultural neurosis, but
only to the extent that the society
deemed it advisable that it be
furthered.

Brown said that probably the
biggest factor causing a cultural
neurosis in America is our socie-
ty’s emphasis upon the ownership
of material wealth.

ries will continue today in the

J. Leavitt will talk about “Groups

ganizations.”

mendous and only beginning to
be tapped. “There is absolutely no
fear of overpopulation or lack of
sufficient food, since the possibil-
ity of increasing yields with scien-
tific methods is tremendous. The
government has said that the
amount of land now under culti-
vation could easily be doubled,”
Hinton stated.

Economy both private and public

China’s economy is mixed, he
continued, with light industry in
private hands and heavy industry,
with a few notable exceptions such
as the chemical industry, in gov-
ernment hands. The railroads al-
ways have been nationalized; how-
ever there are two competitive bus
lines, one private, one state owned.
Both lines run buses made of con-
verted Japanese trucks which
burn wood for fuel. “Stores are
both state and privately owned,
with the state-owned stores usual-
ly taking the lead in lowering
prices, which have fallen steadily
since 1950,” Hinton said. There
were several laughs when Hinton
described how the American block-
ade has been a great boon to
Chinese light industry, which for
the first time is free of foreign

competition.

In the question period which
followed his lecture, Hinton was
asked about Chinese education. He
told of the “tremendous drive to
wipe out illiteracy in the next 10
years, based on a new phonetic
alphabet. All students,” he de-
clared, “are completely subsidized.
However, due to the shortage of
schools, education is highly com-
petitive. There are 10 jobs wait-
ing for every graduate.”

Peasants now know freedom

When asked about the extent of
civil liberties in China, Hinton de-
scribed how the villages in the
past had been ruled by a few
cliques, with the law never reach-
ing the peasants. “Children were
taken in payment of debts and
slavery existed in the countryside.
With the establishment of the
new China, immediately after land
reforms, village councils were
established and democratic elec-
tions held.” These village councils
elect county councils, who in turn
appoint county judges. “For the
first time the peasants knew free-
dom,” Hinton said. He added,
“there is no longer any conscrip-
tion in China, the army being
composed entirely of volunteers.”

Asked about relations between
Russia and China, Hinton de-
clared, “They are close, but China
is certainly not a satellite.” Rus-
sian technicians, tractor men and
combine men have come to teach
and then gone home. There is
much political study, but it is not
Russians who teach this, he added.

Hinton was asked about possi-
bilities for trade with America,
and answered that $6 billion a
year is spent on industrialization
and agriculture by the Chinese
government. There would be a
welcome market for American
tractors, ball bearings, X-ray
equipment and railroad equip-
ment, he concluded.

photographer At Billings, Law-
rence Whitson. The youth had pre-
viously stolen two valuable Ger-
man photographic lenses.

When the thief was seized he
was wearing a spotless white
“Doctor’s” jacket and carrying an
empty box. He in turn implicated
his woman accomplice, also 21,
and after two days of questioning
the pair admitted the larcenies
and check forgeries.

The police said that the youth
stole purses of two University stu-
dents and gave the girl the official
University identification card of
one of the students, Suzanne
Friedmann.

Petition: keep
Rago, Caspari

Mead House is sponsoring

a

petition and an appeal asking for
the retainment of two assistant
professors recently dismissed
from the college, and for the re-
vision of the statute under which
they were dismissed.

The professors, Fritz Caspari
and Henry Rago, fall under a pro-
vision of the University statutes
which says that an assistant pro-
fessor must be promoted to the
rank of associate professor at the
end of his six year contract or else
be dropped from the faculty.

Residents of Mead House ex-
pected to have several hundred
signatures on the petition by to-
day. They will present the appeal
to Chancellor Kimpton this morn-
ing.

Concerning the petition Don
Levine, assistant resident head of
Mead, stated, “Many people on be-
ing asked to sign the petition have
shown a distressing reluctance to
have anything to do with peti-
tions. This seemed to reflect the
general anxiety which has come
to attend almost any social action
throughout our country.”

When a flood of bad checks en-
dorsed by “Suzanne Friedmann”
hit Hyde Park businesses, police
sought out the “real” Miss Fried-
mann and learned that her wallet
and ID card had been taken.

Miss Friedmann said, “My wal-
let was stolen at a Student Gow
ernment meeting during a ten
minute recess several weeks ago.
Nothing important was in it ex-
cept my I.D. card. Apparently one
of the couple, posing as a student,
stole the wallet. Arlene Peterson,
another UC student, had her purse
taken also, but fortunately her
wallet was in her coat pocket.”

At least 15 bad checks, for about
$80 apiece, have been traced and
police added, “we expect more to
come in.”

The pair would buy an article
and make an initial “effort” to
pay for it in cash and then “dis-
cover” they had not brought
enough money along.

They would pay with forged and
stolen payroll checks made out to
Suzanne Friedmann from the
Goldstein Millinery Company, 118
South Michigan. The checks were
drawn on the First National Bank
of Chicago.

Police said the pair used the
money to satisfy their “habit.”
"The more they stole, the more
they used,” said one officer.

The young man was apprehend-
ed when Lawrence Whitson, a Bill-
ings clinical photographer, noticed
him lounging near the photo-
graphic supply shelves at Billings.
Whitson recalled seeing someone
resembling him near the lab when
two valuable German photo-
graphic lenses disappeared.

He pursued the white coated
man but could not catch him.
Whitson, however, notified hospi-
tal and University officials and
alerted them. The thief returned
the next day and walked into the
arms of waiting University of-
ficials.

Strozier settles relationship
between SG and l-F council

Student Government jurisdiction concerning relations with Inter-Fraternity Council and
the individual fraternities has been settled by a letter from Robert M. Strozier, dean of
students, to Gilbert Dahlberg, Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) president.

According to Dean Strozier’s letter (dated March 1,1954), areas falling within SG’s prov-
ince in its relations with IFC and involving the fraternities include:

1.	Discriminatory clauses in
limit or prohibit member-
ship because of race, re-
ligion, color, or national
origin.

2.	Regulations involving the
use of campus facilities.

Dean Strozier clarified SG jur-
isdiction by saying, “We cannot
force campus fraternities to
pledge students who are Jewish,
Christian, or Negro. However, we
can refuse to recognize campus
organizations who retain selectiv-
ity clauses in their national con-
stitutions.” Citing Zeta Beta Tau

in the William Wallace Fenn

House, 5638 Woodlawn Avenue.
Coffee will be served at 7:30 p.m.
and the lecture and discussion will
begin at 8 p.m.

The lecture, which is the third
in a series of six on Unitarianism,
is on “The Emotional Depths in
Religion.” The first two lectures

in the series dealt with the topics
“Why and How Unitarianism Be-
gan” and “Unitarian Conceptions
of Familiar Religious Teachings.”
On succeeding Thursday the se-
ries will continue with “The Uni-
tarian Conception of the Church”
(•March 25); “The Role of Wor-
ship in the Religious Group”
(April 1); and “The Adequacy of
Unitarianism to the Needs of Man
Today” (April 8).

pointed out that recognition will
not be denied campus religious
organizations such as Hillel Foun-

The letter also stated the areas
which will remain under IFC's
province in its relations with the
individual fraternities and the

are:

Wright, professor of political sci-
ence, in the final lecture of the
series, “Your Choice: War or
Peace,” held in East Lounge of
International House at 8 p.m., last
Wednesday.

Wright asserted that” the his-
tory of the United Nations is not

lent organizations, which

nities.

3.	The residential standards of
the house.

4.	The fraternal intramural pro-
gram.

Qualifications and conditions
for rushing, pledging, and initia-
tion of members must, however,
coincide with Part 1, Section 5 of
the Student Code.

“The basis of fraternity mem-
bership is friendship,” Dean Stro-
zier added, “We cannot prohibit
student organizations from choos-
ing their members in this way.”

This letter was written after a

series of conferences between the
dean of students and an IFC com-
mittee to determine more exactly
the relationship between the
Council and Student Government.
“As far as I’m concerned this
matter is settled,” Strozier com-
mented.

too encouraging, since tension and
hostilities remain: “the world is
not tranquilized.” He gave a his-
torical recapitulation of coopera-
tive peace efforts, indicating the
point of and reason for failure of
each. The establishment of the
UN, he said, is the most effective
means, thus far, of achieving
peace. “There can only be inter-
national organization through in-
ternational cooperation.”

The UN provides for more in-
tensive internal organization;
however, the 20th century is still
the most bloody in man’s history.
Old peace methods ineffectual

Wright termed such peace meas-
ures as peace by empire, univer-
sal religion, and. balance of power
as “impracticable.” Peace by em-
pire, he said, would not work, for
“we would not want to be ruled by
the Soviets, and they would not
want to be ruled by us”; the ideo-
logical strife of universal religion
would cause more havoc; and de-
mocracy cannot function under
the political organization of bal-
ance of power.

Loyola newspaper suspended
for ungentlernanly criticisim

“Ungentlemanly attacks on the co-eds and certain admin-
istrators of the university” have resulted in the temporary
suspension of the Loyola News, Loyola University student
newspaper.

Two hours after the controversial issues of the paper were
released on the Lewis Towers and Lake Shore campuses;

Loyola officials criticized the
paper’s editorial staff for their
“ungentlemanly attacks.” The
suspension order was issued by
the Rev. Laurence Lynch, dean of
students. Lynch has charge of the
Loyola Union, which supervises
campus publications.

The questionable matter was an
unsigned letter to the editor which
described the “rat race” of women
students to “land that MAN at all
costs.” Phillip J. McGuire, in his
second week as editor-in-chief, sub-
stantiated the staff’s position in
the matter and maintained that
they “had no malicious intent in
printing the letter,” thinking it
would be taken humorously.

McGuire stated that he expected
a second forum letter to be taken
in the same vein. In it, two of the
paper’s regular columnists, Frank
Covey, Jr., and Richard J. Troy,
wrote a “columnists’ declaration
of independence.” They chided
“repeated injuries and usurpa-

Maintaining the effectiveness of
the UN, he explained its basic ef-
forts in two fields: collective se-
curity—its attempts to prevent
war or conditions leading to war—
and economic and social coopera-
tion—the improvement of basic
conditions, such as health, pover-
ty, and illiteracy.

Collective security vital measure

Wright disagreed with Percy
Corbett, professor of political sci-
ence at Princeton University, who
took the “inadvisable approach”
that economic and social coopera-
tion should be placed before col-
lective security. Both efforts, he
stated, must, of course, be kept
up; however, collective security is
the more important.

There are two methods of col-
lective security, he explained: co-
ordination of forces to prevent ag-
gression and specific settlements
of disputes, through mediation,
conciliation, and arbitration. To
substantiate the value of media-
tion as the most salient method,
he cited Ralph Bunche’s success
through mediation in the Palestin-

PHOTOGRAPHERS

tions” and “establishment of an
absolute tyranny over these col-
umnists.”

The “attacks” on “certain ad-
ministrators,” also cited in the
suspension decree was interpreted
to mean Troy’s sports column in
which the basketball coach,
George Ireland, was criticized for
“lacking the personality and tact
necessary for a college coach.”
Troy said he particularly had ob-
jected to “constant yelling at the
team from the bench.”

Indignation from the Rev. Cle-
tus F. Hartman, athletic director,
and Coach Ireland over previous
articles .was noted in another
sports page story in the Thurs-
day edition.

tion or academic credit.

ian dispute. “Developing a per-
sonal mediator skill is invaluable,”
he urged. This, the UN is work-
ing to develop.

Conference to revise Charter

Plans are being arranged for a
new conference to be held in 1955
to revise the UN Charter. There is
need for revision, Wright felt, in
the voting powers of the nations.
“Weight voting,” he thought,
would be more effective than the
present System, whereby e #c h
member nation receives a single
vote, regardless of population.
However, he advised that the con-
ference might be dangerous for
the development of the UN, since
people are already building up
their hopes, which may result in
disillusion. Wright, smiling, ex-
pressed the feeling of some that
“if we revise the charter, we will
then have a perfect world.” He
did say that although the actual
changes effected by the confer-
ence may be few (because of the
present vote distribution >. it might
be an agency for better under-
standing.

Following his hour talk, Wright
called for a question answer peri-
od, at which time he was queried
on Russia’s position in the UN, the
UN as an information agency, and
UN efforts in the cold war.

Praises Quartet

The practice of haranguing re-
viewers of concerts is not one
which is close to my heart, but
in fairness to the Vegh string
quartet, a few remarks regarding
last week’s review are in order.

There are certainly performers
who trail so far behind one’s
standards, and whose errors of in-
terpretation are so blatant, that
an organized succession of nega-
tive comments is more than suf-
ficient to deal with them. But a
group which presented the most
ambitious program of the year,
and executed it with unanimity,
sensitivity, and more than ade-
quate technique, deserves at least
some specificity of comment.

For example, it is said that the
slow movement of opus 127
sounded interminable. The great-
est music critic of the nineteenth
century, Robert Schumann, made
much the same comment about
this movement in singling it out
for special praise in his articles
on Beethoven. I can conceive of
anyone who has no grasp of late
Beethoven making such a com-
ment in a derogatory sense, but
in that case I would expect the
reviewer to be honest enough to
admit that it is the work and
not the performance that leaves
him cold. The complaint that the
performance lost the forest for
the trees is capable of some sub-
stantiation, if true, for the trees
in this case are variations on a
theme, and they are related to
each other in a very definite way.
If the reviewer has no concept
of how the trees complement each
other to build one of the most sub-
lime forests in music, he should
at least talk about one of the
trees, or a few branches.

Bartok’s fourth quartet is the
most difficult to perform of his
six. Some comment on its struc-
ture, relationship of movements,
effects of movements, and tech-
nical problems, should have been
included.

The reviewer also missed the
reason why the Brahms was not
well performed. It could as well
have been played by four kazoos.
The duties are divided among the
instruments without regard for
their natural division of labor and
incompatibilities. In addition it is
an abominable piece of music,
and it would be quite understand-
able if the players could not bear
to rehearse it.

As for the quartet itself, they
are one of the greatest I've heard.

Anyone who wishes to confirm
this impression should listen to
their recordings of all the Bee-
thoven quartets on Haydn So-
ciety, which have just been re-
leased.

Socialists Unite

For many years I have met stu-
dents who have said to me: "Why
do you socialists always splinter
into little groups, why don’t you
all get together? If you did I
might join you,” they claimed.
Well, two weeks ago in New York
City the two largest * socialist
youth groups joined together in
a new independent youth organi-
zation called the Young Socialist
League (YSL). The new group is
the outcome of many months of
discussion between the Young
Peoples Socialist League (YPSL),
formerly the youth section of the
Socialist Party and the Socialist
Youth League (SYL) previously
affiliated with the Independent
Socialist League.

The new group re-emphasizes
the traditional socialist concern
over democracy and defines so-
cialism as the democratizing of
the m^ans of production and the
control of production along with
the fullest democratic political
and social organization which this
implies. We believe, further, that
the only long run answer to the
major problems facing us today
(i.e. the only “realistic,” “prac-
tical” answer) must still be
sought in socialism. The problem
of the cold war cannot be answer-
ed by supporting either- of the
present power blocs, as each is in-
capable of offering the rest of the
world an answer to their real and
immediate social and economic
problems.

Of especial importance to
youth, of course, is the issue of
civil liberties and academic free-
dom. Most students today recog-
nize the failures of both major
parties to adequately concern
themselves with this problem.
Few have translated this disillu-
sionment into political steps. We
believe that a struggle must be
made on the basis of absolute civil
liberties, for all including Stalin-
ists.

The YSL plans extensive activi-
ties, including a political confer-
ence in New York in July, a sum-
mer school in the fall, possibly in
the midwest, and a weekly publi-
cation called the Challenge, which
will appear as part of Labor Ac-
tion. The national secretary of
the YSL along with the editor of
Challenge will be in Chicago in
early April to talk to interested
people.

Originality stifled

After reading a number of controver-
sial letters on •‘rah-rah boys,” “intel-
lectual snobs’’ and “an insidious apathy
in social activities” on the campus, I
waited in vain for an editorial stand.
Yet even the detailed admonitions of
an alumnus, who plaintively concluded
that “something is wrong” with the
students here, didn’t move you to take
a due position on these significant is-
sues. I hope my opinions will have suf-
ficient strength at least to move you to
print them.

It is my belief that the prime ob-
jective of a worthy university is to
promote academic pursuits. The open-
ing lines of the University’s General
Statement read: “The organization of
the University of Chicago is unique.’
If this means that the university wish-
es to exist as an exemplary Institution
of learning and inquiry, then it should
not yield to unspirited and cowardly
pressures and should persevere as a
university, where the ideal of pursuit of
knowledge can hold its optimum sway.

I may be permitted to indulge in a
brief personal reference. I was first at-
tracted to this university by an elabor-
ate and also glowing account in a
story, featuring Mr. Hutchins, pub-
lished in Time magazine some years ago.
The description which then impressed
me considerably was the reference to
UC students as “tense and intense.”
The notion that one can be relaxed,
“well - balanced” and “wholesome,”
thoroughly enjoying life, and be still
In a position to crave for excellence in
learning is a popular rather than a
discerning observation. While there are
always some impressive exceptions, the
recurrent fact is that so-called whole-
someness in character tends to stifle
originality, encourage conformity and
Inevitably produces mediocrity in
thought.

To be more specific, I should like to
state that in my three years’ experi-
ence here, which Is by no means ex-
haustive, I noticed some addiction to
dogmatic thought and a blind radical-
ism by a number of students, nervously
concerned with social and political
problems. Legitimate as such a concern
may be, it does well to remember that
if the condition of neurosis is not regu-
lated by elements of rational caution,
forward looking open-mindedness and,
above all, a critical self-examination,
the neurotic may not only become men-
tally sterile, but still worse, hysterical.
Moreover, true liberalism of spirit
should transcend even such boundaries
where personal fortunes are affected.
For this reason we still awe those few
men who, by virtue of such liberalism,
could and can exercise substantial de-
tachment in reasoning.

If there is anything “wrong” with
some students, it is their assumption
that personal deprivations and aware-
ness of social and, or political injustices
are grounds to justify counteractive
radicalism in thought orientation. The
impulse for reforms and social action
should never be confused with the
cumbersome task of acquiring basic
knowledge. One reason why Kari Marx,
another of the world's most outstanding
neurotics, lacks depth of perception in
his thought (the theory of Ueberbau
and classless society), lor example, is
the absence of the type of detachment
described above. It is one thing to be
stimulated by abject poverty and per-
sonal misfortunes and another to .be
overwhelmed by them in the process of
analyzing larger human problems.

Human nature still remains an eva-
sive conundrum full of the vibrations of
what Verblen termed “predatory tem-
per.’’ We need more penetration, more
Insights with greater consequences, and
an unrelenting dedication to the ob-
jectives of pure scholarship. For this
reason, not the pursuit of happiness as
such, but ever-present tensions and
personal sacrifices are and should be
the signposts of struggle in the des-
tinies of dedicated Inquirers. The ideal
of pursuit of knoweldge has always had
its high price. But its ultimate rewards
are as priceless as that Ideal is genuine
and pervasive. It was with reference to
this pervasiveness that the Greeks call-
ed the forceful drive for creativity
“daimonion.”

Current trends In higher education
are revealing strange developments.
Frequent discrepancies between enun-
ciations of principles and actual con-
duct of educators are becoming deplor-
able realities to reckon with. On the
other hand, a “great” university is
claiming renown for having selected a
distinguished and popular general as its
president, and is generously continuing
to bestow honorary degrees upon poli-
tical figures prominent in International
life. Also, the quest lor quick results,
easy recognition and reward is making
inroads in the social research centers of
noted universities. In the same vein, the
motive of attracting rather than engag-
ing attention is gaining the upper hand
in the conception and design of research
problems. Perhaps one of the most un-
fortunate by-products of these trends
is evident in the growing number of
students whose inclinations to adapt
to the research interests of influential
professors seem to be only surpassed by
their fearful preoccupations with “mak-
ing a living.”

The extent to which a respectable
university may overlook the hazards of
a gradual debauchery from its raison
d’etre in this harsh struggle, can only
be measured with the sequel of risks it
will continue to incur for convenience,
but with self-deception.

Reverting to the specific issues at
hand, I wish to terminate with a fer-
vent hope. May the University of Chi-
cago, which, alas, has no prerogative
for immunity from self-deception, abide,
with a minimum of equivocation, by its
prime commitment to represent that for
which it is destined—a durable bastion
for exacting and disinterested scholar-
ship.

MAROON
presumptuous

it may indeed be one function
of a university newspaper to pro-
vide experience in certain types of
composition, and criticism may be
among them, but when this prac-
tice conflicts with other local in-
stitutions, the potential value of
which is at least equal to that of
the newspaper (as, for example,
University Theatre), it is time
seriously to examine the raison
d'etre of the Newspaper Critic.
Does this celebrated individual,
in the event we have already seen
or heard the production he is re-
viewing, presume to tell us what
it was all about? There are resi-
dent hereabouts not a few serious
students, presumedly devoting
their lives to various branches of
the arts, who are rather more
qualified for such a task—if it
must be performed — and who
may be contacted through the ap-
propriate departments without
grave difficulty. Suppose, then,
we are so timid as to be fright-
ened away from a projected visit
by The Critic’s disapprobation:
has anybody really benefited? Un-
less, of course, it is the intention
of the Editors to let any George,
Jean, or Nathan protect us from
unpleasantness. A perhaps more
worthy use of this space would
fill it with abstracts of what emi-
nent scholars have written on
the work and its author, leaving
any judgments about the per-
formance to us.

Joel Farber

Exhibit mistreated

R. H. M. ignored a lot of work
which was worthy of mention but
since most of it reposed on top
of bookshelves, it is possible that
he, (who seems by the tenor of
his writing to be a small man),
may not even have seen some of
them, such as Natkins oil por-
trait. Of course it is obvious that
he is inexperienced in judging
pictorial arts, just as others on
the staff seem to be about theater
arts, music, etc. He made an obvi-
ous mistake in calling me a primi-
tive. I couldn’t do one even if I
wanted to which would have the
point of view that the primitive
artist has. I am a trained, practic-
ing printmaker and entered as a
University employee. I am sure
that if a print like “Pigsville”
which I included is good enough
for the Museum of Modern Art it
ought to be good enough for Mr.
March.

As to the “forgery,” I don’t re-
call the album cover, but I do re-
member that one of the first
pieces I did was a copy of a Chi-
nese drawing. I was rather faint
hearted then and only by doing
a great deal of work, rather than
talk, was I able to find out what
I really wanted to do in art. I
don’t think anyone who knew me
as a student here would have ex-
pected me to become a painter or
printer, especially after flunking
history of art. It is not fair to so
judge beginners or call their work
which is done with real sincerity,
“doodles” or “slick.” It .is just
smart-alackness and lends a
cheapness to the MAROON only
topped by the SU handling of the
exhibit.

The exhibition was' without
precedent on this campus in lack

of respect for the artist or his
work. The entry fees resembled
a poll tax system and succeeded
in frightening away a larger,
more comprehensive show. On the
afternoon of the deadline day
there were TWO works submit-
ted. The rest of us withheld our
work and haggled them down.
The dumped hanging was without
excuse and was deeply felt by
the artists who submitted. I
would consider any future SU
shows a physical risk to my work
as well as a waste of time unless
they correct themselves.

The jury was fair to a group
numbering art institute graduates
as well as people who had never
done work before. I wish SU and
R.H.M. had tried.

B. Sincloir

Review justified

I believe that Mr. Troobnick’s
objections to Mr. Sciaky’s review
of Murder in'the Cathedral are
unduly harsh and not wholly jus-
tified.

His letter centers on the review-
er’s suggestion that the play was
translated out of its original in-
tention and fitted to the philos-
ophy of Playwright’s Theatre. It
has been stated rather widely that
Playwright’s is motivated by the
dramatic theories of Bert Brecht.
The theater said as much in its
newsletter for their last produc-
tion, Brecht’s Three Penny Opera.
Mr. Brecht is a humanist, anti-
mctaphysical in theory and anti-
cathartic in poetry and episodic in
dramatic treatment.

Francis Fergusen in “Idea of a
Theatre” discusses Murder with
his usual deep insight. The lines
of analysis head through tradi-
tions of rationalistic and passional
theater to the Theological Mys-
ticism of St. Augustine and the
idea that true freedom and pas-
sage into the City of God is by
perfect submission to the Divine
Will. The play is built to cast a
trance over its audience and pro-
duce in its tragic resolution spir-
itual rejoicing through earthly
mourning.

The performance I saw was
muscular, episodic, rather poli-
tical than mystical; in which the
tail end of the knight’s ironic
humor quite wagged the hound
of heaven.

Permanent peace is Israel’s objective;
present tension harms all of Near East
by Zahava Dudnik *

The problems and prospects of peace in the Near East were discussed by Abba Eban, ambassador of Israel to the
US and permanent UN representative, last Monday, in Judd 126. Eban clarified Israel’s position on the tensions between
his country and the Arab states. He emphasized the historical background, the physical and political geography, and the
economic strife in the Near East.

Eban said that when the UN recommended the establishment of independence in all of Palestine, including a sovereign
State of Israel, the Arab governments announced their intention to oppose that UN policy by armed force. In August,
1949, after two years of hos-

tilities, armistice agreements
endorsed by the Security
Council were approved by Israel
and the Arabs. However, Eban
stated, Israel did not believe
that agreements depending on
military considerations with no
background of normal diplomatic
and economic relationships could
assure more than a temporary
stability. Present hostility in the
Near East, Eban noted, “is a peril
for the region and the world.
The countries involved become
easy prey for foreign powers.”
For this reason the problem is
the preoccupation of all the great
powers, with the burden falling
on the United States—“since the
American people have emerged
to the responsibilities of world
leadership.”

Eban emphasized the aid and
sympathy the US has giv^n Israel
from its founding “in a wilder-
ness of absolutism and despo-
tism.” A partnership, stemming

[isn't this why more people want—and buy—

from striking similarities between
the two countries, has made Israel
turn to the US as a hinterland of
sympathy. An Israeli - American
problem arises only through “a
triangular relationship with the
Arab World.” It is this tug on
American friendship which inten-
sifies the problem. Eban declared.

Israel has small land area

Against this historical back-
ground Eban reviewed Israel’s se-
curity position today from its
geographical and political aspects,
and posed the question, “Is Arab
hostility justified?”

Israel, in comparison to the
Arab world, is but a small terri-
tory along the Eastern Mediter-
ranean, with a desert strip be-
tween it and the Red Sea. It is
only 8,000 square miles to the
Arabs’ 2,600,000 square miles of
sparsely populated and unutilized
fertile lands.

Within the last 40 years no
peoples, other than those of the
Arab world, have attained their
hopes as much as these “privi-
leged children of historic for-
tune.” He declared emphatically,
“We don’t envy the Arab people,
but we don’t apologize for our
8,000 miles—history owes us at
least that much.”

Antagonism hurts both countries

Eban explained that because
there is no positive constructive
relationship with the Arabs, the
areas “material and spiritual
achievement” is hindered. Be-
cause of the lack of mutual eco-
nomic interchange, both coun-
tries, deprived of markets and
sources of supply, are forced into
wasteful commercial practices
and dependence on external aid.
Examples of this economic war-
fare are the defiance of interna-
tional law expressed in the block-
ade of the Suez Canal and the
frontier incidents with Jordan,
Eban said.

He went on to remark that the
wiping out of Israel would still
leave the Arab world with its
original problems of weak social
and economic development. Eban
stated that there is “not a single
issue which could not be solved
by good will on both sides.”
Permanent peace needed

Eban stated that the tentative
plan endorsed by Israel is “re-
newed negotiations with a per-
manent peace as the objective.”
As long as a peace treaty is re-
mote, however, the Armistice
should be observed with full in-

tegrity by both sides. If this were _ _

done, such problems as the reset- offers courses

tlement of refugees, and the glar-

ing violation of maritime law, and
the custodianship of Jerusalem
could be settled.

The refugee problem exists be-
cause of war, Eban declared, and
not because of the establishment
of the State of Israel. “It can be
solved on a regional basis with
the now withheld Arab co-opera-
tion,” he continued. “The Arabs
possess the capacity of land and
water, security, and social and
linguistic aids. Rehabilitation is
easier in the vast, rich Arab do-
main.” Israel would co-operate
and pay compensation to speed
the solution of the problem.

UN should rule Jerusalem

Eban
of its
should
salem”

Eban

stated “The UN, because
authority and dignity,
be custodian of Jeru-

concluded with a state-

ment of his awareness "that an
overnight solution is not possible,
that “progress should be slow,
careful, step by step. With a for-
mula for modest diplomatic rela-
tionships, two kindred people, the
Arabs and the Jews, can construct
a new and prosperous domain in
the Near East.”

CTA fares, communist minds

on collegiate press scene

"Students of eleven colleges in this area recently united in an effort to obtain reduced
fares on the CTA for college students,” the Technology News, newspaper of Illinois Tech,
recently informed its readers. It made the statement that Illinois Tech. Student Association
would be asked to appropriate only twenty-five dollars of each student for this project.
Any Casanovas available?

In a letter to the Maroon, and other colleges, Bob Hope recently announced a nation-wide

Highlight series on Jefferson,
Ways of Mankind7 for WUCB

WUCB will start the spring quarter with several new pro-
grams designed to increase its service to the campus. Foremost
among these is a program series entitled "The Jeffersonian
Heritage,” which won the National Association of Broadcast-
ers award in 1952. It deals with the writings of Thomas Jef-
ferson in a historical framework.

"Through the columns of your
valuable publication please
ask the sororities to nominate
their favorite Campus Casanova,”
said Hope, “and send a picture
with a 100 word explanation of
his qualifications to Bob Hope,
'Casanovas Big Night,’ 5451
Marathon St., Hollywood 28,
Calif.” Shall we fortify our en-
trenched reputation and refuse
to participate? Or is there one
among us?

College papers censored

Another bombshell has been felt
on the campus press front. The
complete Texas A & M Battalion
staff recently resigned rather
than submit to the “supervision”
of a committee set up by the stu-
dent government. The events pre-
cipitating the SG action were the
Battalion’s articles on the ouster
of a student last fall for challeng-
ing some Aggie tradition in a let-
ter to the editor. More recently
the Battalion published articles
criticizing the school administra-
tion on the “too light” action
taken against three freshman
cadets who stole $2,500 worth of
goods. The students in question
were suspended by the Dean of
Men with the implied stipulation
that they might be reinstated at
some future date.

The editors insisted the commit-
tee was created to censor their
newspaper. Even the bowling
news writer resigned claiming
that eventually bowling scores
might be censored, too.

The Red and Black, student pa-
per of the University of Georgia,
which incurred the wrath of a
powerful university regent with
an anti ■ discriminatory editorial
has gone through its second set
of editors since censorship was

imposed. The Red and Black is express any screwy ideas. To be
now run by a former assistant popular you have to conform." A
sports editor and a faculty adviser Vassar girl put it this way: "We’re
who reads all copy before it is a cautious generation. We aren’t

published.

The following item is reprinted

How to stay out of trouble:
Appraised that the Massachusetts
legislature might investigate com-
munist activities at Westfield
State Teachers College, its presi-
dent, Edward J. Scanion, was
quoted by the Holyoke Daily
Transcript as stating in part:

"I know of no Reds or commu-
nist-minded persons either among
the faculty or the students here
. . . The type of students who
go here are not of the highly in-
tellectual type among which such
tendencies exist ...”

buying any ideas we’re not sure
of.”

Although many students drink,
Newsweek said, they do not drink
heavily. The President of Prince-
ton University estimates that for
every beer sold at local restau-
rants students drink three to four
gallons of milk. A Princeton stu-
dent said, “You can’t drink and
keep up your studies.”

As for world problems, “colle-
gians gave little thought to poli-
tics or international troubles.”

A large number “accepted Mc-
Carthyism, although a goodly
number in all institutions ques-
tioned its methods.” Students
“were wary of anything with a
Red tinge.”

"Ways of Mankind" dramatized

This series, produced by the
National Association of Educa-
tional Broadcasters (NAEB),
will be, co-starred with a second
NAEB series, “The Ways of Man-
kind,” a dramatized anthropologi-
cal study. This series deals with a
number of cultures, including sev-
eral studied in Social Sciences 2.

In the planning stage are a
dramatic program which will fea-
ture recorded classics of the thea-
tre alternated with productions by
a local drama group, and a panel
discussion program on compara-
tive religion.

Range to be extended

All the above programs, and the
programs now schedulea, are
broadcast at 640 KC by WUCB’s
high-fidelity transmitters in BJ
and the C-Group. Plans are now
being made for an extension of
WUCB’s range into the dormitory
groups not now covered by it, and
the continuing increase in person-

nel will facilitate this increase in
campus service.

Station Manager John Lyon an-
nounced Wednesday in an open
meeting, “Technically, WUCB is
in excellent condition. Program-
ming quality and quantity are
both better than last year, de-
spite the inevitable end-of-quarter
lag.

Staffers trained

"Workshops in enginering and
announcing are helping new staff
members to learn, and a number
of inexperienced persons are tak-
ing advantage of this service.
However, the station is certainly
not perfect, and we are hoping
for a continuing improvement:
Campus suggestions designed to
help this improvement will be ap-
preciated.”

For those who are obliged to
spend the Spring Interim in the
dormitory system, WUCB will
broadcast WEFM.

Navy frowns on beards

The Air Force and the Army
ROTC have given their approval
to a beard growing contest at the
University of Texas, although the
Navy didn’t. Applicants will be
excused from shaving for drill
periods. The five divisions in the
contest are: best all-around beard,
bushiest, sexiest, most unique,
and the best peach fuzz. Perhaps
the most interesting fact here is
that Texans will admit to growing
peach fuzz.

Newsweek Magazine decided re-
cently in a study of seven univer-
sities across the country that col-
lege students seem dull in com-
parison with their predecessors of
less-troubled eras. They found
that students seem to be afraid to
be different and have wild hair
cuts, swallow gold fish, and carry
on other “infantile practices.” A
Northwestern co-ed said, echoing
prevalent opinion, “You want to
be popular, so naturally you don’t

High fidelity grips the campus

is intellectual’s answer to opium

Like most fads rampant among the intelligentsia, the high fidelity craze has taken UC
by storm.

To some of its followers, "Hi-Fi” is a hobby; to others, it is a science; to most, it is a habit,
not unlike addicition to some insidious derivative of the opium poppy. For, once introduced
to the "new world of sound,” the initiate must graduate to higher and higher (and more
expensive) kicks, until he is reduced to a formless blob condemned to pass through life
with a pair of well-trained ears

that can hear a cockroach
crawling across a bear rug at
20-20,000 cps, plus or minus 0.1 db.
In railroad stations he writhes in-
wardly when the voice of the con-
ductor comes over the extremely
low-fi speaker, and he looks for-
ward to a telephone call with
dread.

Folklore Society draws crowd

by Bob March

One evening early this quarter, a group of about 15 UC folk musicians walked into the
Ida Noyes dance room for the founding meeting of a new student organization, the Folklore
Society. To their amazement, they were awaited by a crowd of 100 and a tape recorder.

Now, several weeks, three parties, and 110 members later, the Society has become one
of UC’s largest student organizations. Chairman Moe Hirsch, a student in the Math de-
partment, says "We originally started the club as a clearing house for folk musicians . . .

we expected 20 or 30 mem-

bers .

I guess people on

Seeger concert in Mandel Hall, its scope by starting classes in

this campus just like our

music.”

Hirsch cut his musical eye-teeth
in New York’s folk music crowd,
where a premium is placed on in-
strumental skill, and is one of the
top guitarists in the country.

Unembellished voices welcome

But membership is not confined
to the purveyors of the flashy
instrumental — the bulk of the
membership consists of people
who come to the Society’s get-
togethers unencumbered with in-
strument case, and only "bring
their voice.” Young instrumental-
ists are given hints and encour-
agement by the older members,
and encouraged to "try it out be-
fore an audience.’

The Society’s first two get-
togethers were "Wing-Dings,” in-
formal early evening get-togeth-
ers in Ida Noyes. About 25 mem-
bers performed at each one. Music
ranged from the usual come-all-
ye’s, ballads, and hoedowns to
Afro-Cuban chants and bagpipe
solos by guests in the regalia of
the Stockyards Kilty Band. The
Society also ran a party, square
dance and folk festival in the
basement of the Phi Psi house.

Parties and wing-dings planned

Plans for next quarter call for
one party and one Wing-Ding
each month.

The Folklore Society Quartet,
a combination square dance band
and vocal quartet, will participate,
along with Afro-Cuban singer Ella
Jenkins, in the forthcoming Pete

April 3.

folk and square dancing and com-

The Society hopes to broaden piling an archive of folk music.

Musicians flag-pole sitters?

And never again can he enjoy
a symphony concert, for what live
symphony orchestra ever sounds
like a faithful reproduction of a
symphony orchestra? No, a high
fidelity LP of an orchestra sounds
exactly like a concert performed
in a vast exponential cavern, with
the musicians clinging to a flag-
pole rising up in the middle.

Addiction begins when an old
hi-fi addict informs the initiate
that his battered changer is chew-
ing up his priceless LP’s like a
turret lathe, and that foi a mere
cash outlay of $795 this atrocious
situation may be corrected. By the
time the new addict has obtained
his 50-pound British output trans-
former, he has been thrown out of
his apartment for non-payment of
rent and is blissfully living side-
by-side with a 21 inch speaker in a
folded horn cabinet, oblivious to

everything but the beauty of his
linear all-triode amplifier.

Work to support gluttonous hi-fi

Then, if he gets smart, he be-
comes a "pusher,” taking out a
dealership and peddling custom
equipment to his fellow students.
You can tell the pushers from the
addicts—they eat. They can afford
to support the electronic monster
at the end of their living room,
winking with its glowing fila-
ments and blowing fuses with its
home-soldered connections.

Hi-fi highbrow TV

In the final stage of addiction,
the Audiophile starts designing
amplifiers and speaker cabinets
that nobody can afford to build
except somebody who has enough
money to know better. In this
stage, the addict hocks his speaker
to buy postage stamps to send let-
ters to audio magazines and takes
to watching string quartets on his
oscillograph.

US press distorts USSR

claim Soviet journalists

Our last few days in the Soviet Union were spent in Moscow. After almost three weeks in
the country, I was beginning to be able to read store signs and even understand the sense
of the conversations around me. I had brought a Russian grammar along and received some
lessons from my interpreter. The feeling of strangeness, that probably any foreigner feels
in another country — where the language barrier is very ^reat — had worn off; the last
three days in Moscow became very meaningful.

It was during this period
that we visited the building
of Pravda. Pravda, meaning
• truth,” is published by the cen-
tral committee of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union. It is
one of the two major all-union
i for the entire Soviet Union)
daily newspapers. Isvestla, the
other, is published by the highest
body of Soviet trade unions.

Pravda mentioned visit

Actually, all Soviet newspapers
appear six days a week. In addi-
tion to all-union papers there are
local city papers. There is a spe-
cial Moscow edition of Pravda,
and in Leningrad I bought a news-
paper called The Evening Lenin-
grad. Our group was mentioned
in the latter paper on January 4,
the day after we arrived in Lenin-
grad. Pravda also carried a short
item the day after we arrived in
the Soviet Union. Both the arti-
cles contained only our names,
schools, student newspapers, and
the general plans for the trip.

There is another type of peri-
odical that is common in USSR;
this is the Youth newspaper
which is published for age groups
of 14 to 25. In the cities we visited,
we frequently were interviewed
by the editors of the different
youth newspapers.

This photograph taken from our moving car show an outlying area of
Leningrad. The clothing is typical for a ten-below xero day. The store on
the left side is an "apteka" or drugstore. Only drugs and medicines are
sold in such stores.

Met editors

In Moscow we had an informal
meeting with part of the editorial
board of Komsomolsky* Pravda.
The offices of this publication, an
all-union daily, were in the
Pravda building.

We met in a large paneled con-
ference room and were served
fresh fruit and tea during the dis-
cussion. The paper, the editors
explained, was published by the
central committee of the Kom-
somol. This did not mean the pa-
per was primarily political. The
paper had twelve departments in-
cluding cultural activities, Kom
somol affairs, student affairs, and
activities of young workers.

Each department was presided
over by an editor; these persons
formed the editorial board which
determined the policy of the pa-
per. Komsolmolskaya Pravda had
a circulation of about 1,600,000
with no advertising. The editors
said the subscriptions and news-
stand sales paid the cost of the
paper. The [hice was 20 kopeks
(or 5 cents).

Talked about peace

We had a long discussion with
the editors about journalism,
American - Soviet relations, and
the prospects for peace.

Concerning journalism, we

Conclude USSR
report

This is the final report by
Richard E. Ward, MAROON man-
aging editor, on his recent trip to
the Soviet Union. He spent three
weeks in the USSR with six other
American college editors.

The adjacent account gives some
of Ward's views on the trip.

learned that some universities
have journalism schools; Moscow
University for example, but most
soviet journalists did not study
journalism. Soviet newspapers do
not print stories of so-called petty
crimes, such as robberies, as-
saults, or even murders. They
were familiar with such accounts
in American newspapers and felt
that such stories incited further
crimes.

The editorial board was con-
vinced that reports of the Soviet
Union were always distorted in
the American Press. We admitted
that we had to agree with them
to an extent on this point.

Actually, we often found that
our experiences differed from ac-
counts of life in the-USSR in the
American Press.

Interviewed by Americans

We had met two of the Amer-
ican correspondents in Moscow
shortly after our arrival. These
two men, representing the AP and
UP wire services, and Harrison
Salisbury of the New York Times,
are presently the only American
newsmen in the Soviet Union.

We told the Komsomolskaya
Pravda editors we believed that
these men sent out accurate ac-
counts. It was interpretive ac-
counts presented in the form ef
news that we felt created false
impressions of the general Soviet
scene.

Talked of peace

Our interview was concluded
when we discussed the prospects
of peace. The Soviet editors had
a good knowledge of world events.
Our talk took place shortly before
the Berlin Conference, and they
pointed to that as the beginning
of more peaceful relations be-
tween our two countries.

We had a lull schedule during
the last two days in Moscow—our
last trip to the ballet and a visit
to the tomb of Lenin and Stalin.
The latter is situated adjacent to
the Kremlin and is a striking red
marble construction. Soviet cit-
izens wait many hours in long
lines to visit the mausoleum, but
we were given places near the

front of the line.

Moscow has a museum similar
to the Museum of Science and In-
dustry in Chicago, even to the
extent that the mechanical ex-
hibits sometimes worked only part
of the time. Museums are abund-
ant throughout the Soviet Union.
Many are of a type familiar to us,
such as the art museums. There
are numerous historical museums,
also, which illustrate the history
of a particular town, republics,
or noted personages.

Auto production increasing

Testimony to the Soviet Union’s
expanding heavy industry was
the traffic in Moscow. Trucks ap-
peared to outnumber cars in other
cities, but the number of passen-
ger cars have increased rapidly
in the past few years. We could
get no figures on the total number
of cars, certainly not more than a
fifth the number that would be
in a similarly sized American city.
However, there were almost no
pre war models in sight. There
were very few cars at that time.

The cost of the cheapest auto-
mobile was 8000 rubles, or $2,000.
This is still beyond the reach of
the average worker.

Describe deportment stores

Moscow has two large depart-
ment stores. These were well-
filled with ordinary commodities
and also luxury items such as
stylish clothing and console ra-
dios.

GUM (abbreviation for “gov-
ernment universal store”) the
newest of the two, was opened last
December and was jammed. We
had to make our purchases in
Mortag, located near the Bolshoi
theatre, because GUM was too
crowded.

Radios scarce, inexpensive

Prices on radio equipment was
inexpensive and comparable to
American prices. However, such
items are not always in sufficient
stock. Television is new to the
Soviet Union. We received a
demonstration at the Polytechnic
Museum of three sets presently in
production. The industry began
two years ago, and the average
set has a 10-inch screen. A larger
number of scanning lines are
used than on American sets.

Most prices in the department
stores appeared expensive. Be-
cause there is no free trade be-
tween the U. S. and the Soviet
Union, the ruble has been arbitrar-
ily placed at 25 cents. This puts
the American at a considerable
disadvantage in the exchange. It
is, therefore, difficult to estimate
the actual costs of items in terms
for Soviet citizens, without know-
ing their precise incomes.

We left Moscow on the morning
of January 19. Two of our inter-
preters accompanied us to the air-
port. They sipped tea with us as
the plane was to be delayed an
hour. We didn’t talk much.

Editors were insistent

I had the feeling they would
puzzle over us for a long time.
We had been very insistent in our
demand throughout the trip and
undoubtedly we received many
privileges such as meeting Shosta-
kovich and going back-stage at the
Bolshoi, which were not part of
the regular tourist privileges. The
interpreters were the only Soviet
citizens we were with long enough
to really become acquainted with.

There was a minimum of red-
tape at ihe airport. There1 was no
customs inspection; we only had
to show our passports and plane
tickets. The plane was uneventful.
That afternoon we arrived in East
Berlin,,two days later we were in
New York City.

These three girls ore students in secondary school number 19 in Tblisi,
Georgia, USSR. The girls of the school were anxious to show their knowl-
edge of English, and gave us simple and genuine expressions of their friend-
ship in the form of New Year's cards and peace pins.

Ward: travel helps

allay mutual distrust

In my preceding articles I have tried to give an accurate
impression of some phases of Soviet life. Although our visit
was for only three weeks, it would be impossible to completely
describe my experiences in anything short of a book.

In these three weeks I believe our group learned a great
deal about the Soviet people, their economic life, their cul-

tural life, and even their
thoughts on different political
questions.

We had been in the Soviet
Union only a few days when we
realized how incomplete our
knowledge was of Soviet life, and
that much which is considered
common knowledge in the United
States is erroneous.

. USSR falsely pictured

Often, we are given accounts
telling of extreme poverty among
Soviet citizens. This we found
completely untrue. It would seem
well to realize that there is no
large nation in the world that has
as high an average standard of
living in the US. There was a
great amount of destruction of
the western portions of the USSR
during the last war. Much of the
Soviet resources went into re-
pairing this damage. Probably the
standing of living in the Soviet
Union is now comparable to Eu-
rope as a whole.

On our return to America we
found intense interest in our trip
to the USSR. We encountered a
similar interest on the part of
Soviet citizens concerning life in
the US.

It would be foolish to consider
that the people of the Soviet
Union are expressing disfavor for
their system of government be-
cause of their interest in the US.
Rather, it would seem to be a
genuine interest in peace. I would
likewise interpret the many ques-
tions about the USSR by Amer-
icans.

Talked of peace

When the Soviet students said
they were in favor of peace, we
could answer that we knew the
vast majority of American were
certainly in favor of peace. The
Soviet students believed this.

We could have stopped our dis-
cussion at this point and consider-
ed all disagreements solved. How-
ever, we were all extremely aware
of the precarious relationship be-
tween the US and the Soviet
Union.

We found a further point of
agreement. There is a mutual
fear between our respective coun-
tries. The Soviet people consider
themselves surrounded by Amer-
ican air bases. At the same time
we realized that the Soviet Union
has a large army. Young men in
the Soviet Union are drafted at
twenty for a two year term of
military training. Only students
are completely exempt from such
training.

I do not really know of the dif-
ficulties encountered by a foreign-
er who previously wanted to
travel in the Soviet Union. I had
heard of some denied visas. At the
same time all Soviet citizens were
being barred from, the US by the
McCarran Act unless given per-
mission from the Justice Depart-
ment.

Our group, and the preceeding
group of American editors en-
countered no difficulty in receive-
ing Soviet visas.

Many of the Soviet students
with whom we talked expressed
their desire to travel in the United
States. At the same time they re-
minded us of the McCarran Act,
and said that under these circum-
stances they did not feel free to
attempt a trip to the United
States.

It would seem logical that since
two American groups have recent-
ly visited the Soviet Union, that
the door be opened for Soviet
students.

I am not proposing that such
an exchange of students will solve
any major world problems. But
when such international travel
exists it can be a step in alleviat-
ing any mutual distrust.

I have just received a letter
from one of the other editors from
our group. He states that he had
written to one of our interpreters
in Moscow and had received a
reply. He described the letter as
“short and somewhat formal —but
it was a reply.”

'Rome 11 O'clock' Zavattini's best

During the past few months Italian film makers have been engaged in a review of the structure and pur-
poses of the Italian cinema. The earlier post-war films, those even that have become veritable classics, have
been subjected to scrutiny and analysis in order to determine whether the Italian cinema has indeed de-
served its epitaph, "neo-realism." In the course of this review films such as Bicycle Thief with its gripping

portrayal of the dilemma
of its protagonist, have
been examined to see if they
actually give a true picture of
present day Italy, or if they
show rather only incidents of an
accidental nature that, detached
from immediate urgency, are, to
quote the critic Pio Baldelli, “like
scattered, partly withered leaves.”

Most of the film makers have
been in agreement on one con-
clusion—that the bulk of films
thus far have only touched the
surface of reality and that for
subsequent films to be success-
ful they must show that there
is more to Italy “than meets the
eye.”

Yet, within this conclusion there
has been difference. The critic

Father Dunn

Armando Borrelli demands that
“realism reveal the movement of
reality,” that “it make use of the
facts only as a springboard from
which to plunge even deeper into
reality so as to grasp the origins
of those facts” while the more con-
servative film writer, Cesare Za-
vattini, has seldom departed from
his position that the naked facts
and details of poverty are the
strongest substance of reality.

Nevertheless, in his most re-
cent film, “Rome, Eleven O’-
clock,” (now playing at the
World Playhouse and soon to
be at the Hyde Park), made
with the director, Guiseppe De-
Santis (Biter Rice, etc.), Zavat-
tini has begun to venture be-
hind the facts. Certainly his ven-
ture has come of necessity.
Since “Bicycle Thief,” the major
Italian films have based them-
selves upon Italy’s acute unem-
ployment situation. Though
Zavattini has been able, in such
films as “Miracle in Milan,” to
avoid direct contact with this
issue, the poignancy of “Two
Cents Worth of Hope,” among
others, has made it impossible
for him to further ignore it.

Rome, Eleven O’clock goes be-
yond the mere fact of unemploy-
ment to suggest its causes. It tells
the story of some 300 girls who
crowd onto a four-story staircase
in response to an advertisement
for one office secretary. When one
girls rushes up the stairs out of
turn a fight begins, the stairway
collapses, one girl is killed and
numerous are injured with vary-
ing severity.

An investigation of the cause
of the collapse is begun in which
the suspects include the impa-
tient girl, whose impatience
came of the long term unem-
ployment of herself and her hus-
band (it was indicated that most
of the girls faced similar situa-
tions), the owner and the archi-
tect of the building, and the
prospective employer. During

the proceedings the narrative
continually asks the question,
“Who is to blame?” By means of
a well executed montage we get
glimpses into the histories of
the suspects and of the other
young women on the stairway,
including a streetwalker who at-
tempts to forsake an affair with
a prosperous businessman in fa-
vor of a decent job and a girl
from a wealthy home who has
married a poor artist. We see
(though insufficiently, because
of the choice and type of char-
acterizations), the influences of
these people on one another.
When the film ends all suspects
are released and we are re-
turned to the outside of the
building where we see one girl
back waiting for the one job.

Aside from the typical DeSantis
tendency to put an unjustified
pulchritude parley into the film,
Rome, Eleven O’clock has some
of the faults of Zavattini’s previ-
ous scripts. Too often convenient
coincidences and heavy irony —
for instance, while waiting on the
stairs the young woman who steps
out of turn becomes most friendly
with the girl who dies—are used
for dramatic intensity, whereas
the drama should more realistic-
ally have been heightened by pre-
senting the major protagonists in
clearer-cut characterizations. As it
is now, the irohy imposes an aura
of mechanical predestiny over the
film.

On the whole—despite the afore-
mentioned idiosyncrasy — DeSan-
tis has accomplished his most suc-
cessful direction in this film. In
addition to excellent handling of
personnel, his photography and
editing carry the viewer through
every scene without distraction.
In the stairway collapse scene,
we are aware of every fall, we
know how each young woman
clings for her life, yet we sense
a wrong, we anticipate the ques-
tion that is to come.

Yet—and herein is the major

failing of the film—that ques-
tion, “Who is to blame?'1 is
never answered. The responsi-
bility for this failure lies not
least with the narrative struc-
ture of the film and partly with
Zavattini’s refusal to venture
too far from the “naked facts.”
Any one of the the alternatives
— poor building construction,
poor maintenance, the rush
started by the impatient young
woman, the employer’s inter-
viewing procedure, or the unem-
ployment itself and the factors
contributing to it—had it been
presented as the answer would

Collegium to present second program;

features works by Telemann, Bach

Richard E. Vikstrom

This Sunday, the Collegium Musicum, a chamber orchestra composed of students, faculty
i^pbers of ^e University community, will present its second program of the year in
Mandel Hall. Conducted by Richard Vikstrom, the program will feature works by Sammar-
tmi, Telemann, Bach, Beethoven and Haydn.

The first work, the Concerto Grosso for String Orchestra, Op. 11, No. 4, is by Giuseppe
Sammartini, the brother of the better known Giovanni Battista. Giuseppe was an oboe
virtuoso of the first half of the ---------------------—-------------------------------

eighteenth century, and was
first oboist at the Italian
Opera in London and later cham-
ber musician to the Prince of
Wales. At his death in 1740 he left
some 38 compositions, including
six concerti grossi. The soloists
will include George Kulles and
Paul Revitt, violins, Julius Klein,
’cello and Wilfred Weeks, bass.

Georg Philipp Telemann
(1681-1767) was a contemporary
of Bach, and the most celebrated

composer
numerous

of his time. He held
important positions.

and declined an offer of the post
of cantor at the Thoniasschule,
which Bach later accepted. An
amazingly prolific composer, he
left approximately 4,(MM) works
for all sorts of combinations.
The Collegium will perform his
Concerto for Flute and Orches-
tra, with James Mack as soloist.

Next on the program is Bach’s
Sonata No. 1 for Viola da Gamba
and Cembalo, with Julius Klein,
gamba and Gerald Phillips, cem-
balo. The viola da gamba was a
five or more stringed instrument
tuned in fourths and thirds, and

played like a 'cello, with a
but expressive tone.

The concert closes with
thoven’s Trio, Op. 87 for
Oboes and English Horn,

small

Bee-
Two
with

Robert Goldstein and Howard
Friden, oboes, and Leland Smith,
English horn, and Haydn’s Sym-
phony in C Minor, called No. 78
by one of the many systems of
numbering, presumably from
his fruitful but lesser known
middle period.

The concert begins at 8:30 p.m.,

Joyce Hiller os Leah in the pro-
duction of THE DYBBUK, the well-
known play by S.^Ansky depicting
Chossidic life among the Jewry of
Eastern Europe, to be presented by
the B'nai B'rith Hillel foundation
at the University of Chicago on
Sunday, April 4, in Mandel Hall
at 8:30 p.m.

charge.

'God in You' personal interpretation of religious life;
Eby not convincing in projecting values into society

"The God in You," by Kermit Eby.
UC Press. 1954. 162 pp. $2.50.

After reading Prof. Eby’s
book one is painfully reminded
of the realism issuing from
Nietzsche’s assertion that there
was only one Christ and He died at
the cross. For, irrespective of, or
perhaps in spite ol, the title of
the book, the central theme of it
is a conjuration of “Brethren
value” and “Brethren image of,
the good man.”

It is equally painful to resist
the pious incantations, which
seem to decorate the vividly
noble spirit of the author. Cer-
tainly, the plausibility of this
resistance is not ignored by the
author, who qualifies some of
his descriptions and pleas, by a
diplay of incidental doubts about
their real merits. Thus, by mak-
ing the statement: “Attitudes
aie caught, not taught” as the
title of his C hapter VII, he clear-
ly acknowledges the impact of
life experiences upon individual
attitudes. Yet, in line with his
main moralistic orientation, he
opens this same chapter with
the nebulous definition that “At-
titudes are what we are at
heart” (p. 87).

One is inclined to believe that
one reason for this common ambi-
valence is Professor Eby’s force-

Oooops. . .

ful yet objectively untenable pro-
jection of his values and wishes
into the web of social realities. In-
deed, the book is predicated upon
and revolves around, an intense
self • consciousness closely allied
with a form of autobiography.
The author has the inveterate
urge to make his life experiences
edifying universally. The insist-
ence that it is not difficult to
practice “an example of fellow-
ship’’ and “the formula of service”
• 96), illustrates the unfortunate
sway of this attitude in his think-
ing—or at least in his arguments.

The designation, “Truth has a
Double Face,” of Chapter 10,
aroused considerable interest in
this reviewer, in terms of its ap-
pearance of defying simplemind-
edness. The expectations aris-
ing from this interest were as
unjustified as the subsequent
realization that one shouldn’t
take titles too seriously.

As usual, the entire discussion
is punctuated by illustrations and
recounts of personal experiences.
But ultimately they prove to be
an implied dichotomy of the truth
of the self “against the one true
Way” (132).

Nor can one dismiss this di-
chotomy by the author's indul-
gence in a concluding platitude,
which broadcasts the idea that
“truth is ... that by which they
live and on which they act.” In
the estimation of this reviewer,
the most tangible contribution
Professor Eby offers in his book
is the discussion on “the hero as
a man.” Here is ample confirma-
tion of the Spenglerian verdict
which ascribes a Faustian spirit
to contemporary civilization,

where seif • assertiveness and
ultimate heroism are dominant
principles. Here is evidence of
an unmistakable realization, at-
testing to the universal sway of
“the terrifying will to destruc-
tiveness.”

The author bitterly assails the
fact that “We brethren claim to
be a pacifist church. Yet fewer
than 10 per cent of our boys main-
tained that pacifist position in the
last war” (167). But, is complain-
ing identical with, or is it condu-
cive to, an understanding of the
underlying factors of this phenom-
enon? To a Harvard anthropolo-
gist, man is still a predatory ape,
acquisitive, savage, and inexor-
ably selfish when confronted with
crucial as well as critical alterna-
tives. To Professor Eby, on the
other hand, and to Niebuhr, who
wrote the Foreward, religious life,
or dedication to religious principle
and God, may provide an answer
to the perplexing and harsh reali-
ties of civilized life. Goethe, who
dramatized the idea of the Faus-
tian culture, with his monumental
work bearing the same name, had
an answer to the question as to
how indispensable religion is. His
answer is poeticized as follows:

Wer wissenschaft und Kunst
besitzt

Er hat Religion

Wer sie nicht besitzt

Er habe Religion

• He who has arts and sciences
Has also religion; He who doesn’t
have them He should have re-
ligion.)

May we never forget that
most religions, Christianity in-
cluded, arose out of efforts to

ELIOT
ELIOT
ELIOT
ELIOT
ELIOT
ELIOT

solve existing social problems.
Yet, did they prove helpful?
Mannheim’s definition of his-
tory as “the matrix of human
nature” is quite succinct in inti-
mating man's basic ineptness to
embrace religion consequential-
ly. This ineptness is not only his-
torically valid, but, because of
that, indicative of the sway of
forces, w h i c h Mefy religious
fervor, for that matter, even the
ideal of celestial happiness.

Prof. Eby’s references to Koest-
ler (“men cannot be treated as
units”) p. 163; to Dostoevski’s
authoritarian Inquisitor, p. 150;
and, through a moving recount in-
volving his daughter’s essay,
(where she bravely emulates her
father’s ethic as a high school stu-
dent) to Machiavelli, are interest-
ing but do net exhaust the implica-
tions of the problems they refer
to. Their pathological dimensions
are, for example, either ignored
or relegated to the factors of un-
ethical and irreligious attitudes.

The author's account of “stu-
dents of mine” who, animated
by higher ideals of service to
the “Worker,” proceeded to
serve, but, confronting the work-
er “with the small ‘w,’ ” experi-
enced shock and dismay, and his
evaluations symbolize this in-
adequacy. Prof. - Eby, with his
acumen and thoughtfulness,
could have more out of these
facts than plead: “Forgive us
our temptations.”

Until exponents of religion pro-
vide more convincing Evidence
about their claims imputing prob-
lem solving qualities to religion,
the merits of their arguments will
not transcend the virtue of pious-
ness and possibly of eloquence.

Compared to Buckley’s de-
pressing naivete in God and Man
at Yale, Professor Eby’s treat-
ment of the problem is a jewel
of soundness and maturity. Yet
considering the ultimate merits
of his treatment, the temptation
to see a basic congeniality of
judgment between the two is
strong.

have produced a dramatically
flat ending. And certainly Za-
vattini could not fall back upon
a deliberately absurd ending as
in “Miracle in Milan.” Only by
presenting the naked facts, al-
beit this time with some large
scratches beneath the surface,
could this narrative structure
be effective.

Zavattini had a choice. He could
have stuck to the naked facts as
he did with Bicycle Thief and pro-
duced an irresolute story, thereby
rejecting the developments in the
realistic approach since Bicycle
Thief, or he could have presented
the facts with some background.
In choosing the later he has writ-

to answer it implicitly, Rome,

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Women's athletic group to celebrate anniversary

by Spike Pinney

Uncheered, unsubsidized,
and relatively unknown, the
Woman’s Athletic Association
(WAA) will complete fifty years
of activity this spring at its annual
awards banquet. It is time for
some recognition, and perhaps
some cheers, for any such associa-
tion that has survived that long in
an environment hostile to fem-
inine activity more strenuous than
- for instance—bridge.

WAA and women’s athletics in
general have followed a course
closely parallel to men’s athletics.
Very popular and well supported
from the time Ida Noyes Hall
was built in 1916 on through the
twenties, WAA did not start de-

Spring-UC
nine starts
practicing

With the opening day double-
header on April 3 less than a
month away, varsity Baseball
coach, Kyle Anderson, has begun
heavy drills on the North Field for
his present 27 man squad. Ander-
son, noting the return of a large
number of experienced lettermen
and players from the 1953 squad,
envisions a successful season for
the Maroons.

The corps of lettermen include
infielders Wendell Marumoto,
Dave Utley and Bruce Colby, and
outfielders George Grey and Bob
Mann. Strengthening the infield
from last year’s varsity and JV
squad are Mario Baur, Jeff Marks
and Don Mazukell.

Broyles main pitcher

The pitching staff looks strong
and ambitious, according to An-
derson. Veteran chucker John
Broyles is bolstered by rookies
Paul Hershall, Charles Young-
quist and Jerry Lux—all with ex-
perience on high school teams.
First string catcher appears to be
rookie Walt Walker.

Anderson still looks forward to
spirited competition for his nine,
and with the short time until open-
ing day hopes that more boys who
hope for action on this year’s
squad will take advantage of the
two daily practice sessions at
12:30 and 3:30, and of the vaca-
tion practice.

dining until Hutchins, in 1932, put
physical education on a purely op-
tional basis as part of his new plan
of education; it would have
seemed peculiar to have gym the
onl^ class with required attend-
ance. Before 1932, WAA had
played a large role in campus so-
cial life, sponsoring parties and
dances. Afterwards Student Union
began to take over more of these
functions.

Because of the optional attend-

Skown above are three girls par-
ticipating in three of the sports
offered by the Women's Athletic
Association — bowling, basketball
and volleyball.

Fencers to face
college champs
in NCAA meet

Some of the nation’s best col-
legiate fencers will compete in the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation championships which will
be held in Bartlett Gym, Friday
and Saturday, April 23 and 24.
Over’ forty schools will enter
three-man teams, each school hav-
ing one competitor in each
weapon.

Chicago will be represented by
Ernie Dunston, major letter win-
ner, in foil; Alex Shane, another
third-year fencer, in epee; and Da-
vis Bobrow, a first-year fencer, on
sabre.

The Maroons close their season
in a home meet tomorrow against
Notre Dame and Lawrence Tech.

WHY INCH THROUGH HIGHWAY TRAFFIC or wait until skyway weather
clears? Take a train home and keep that very first date for sure!
IT’S MORE FUN GOING with the crowd all together on the train. There’s
room for bridge or bull session. And, in the dining car, you can
enjoy the next best to home cooking. ,

GO FOR 25% LESS than the regular coach fare by traveling home and
back with two or more friends on Group Economy Plan Tickets.
They’re good on trips of 100 miles or more. Gather a group of 25 or
more and you each save 28% riding long-distance on the same
train, then returning as a group or individually.

ance plan, which was to run for
a ten year trial period, the ath-
letic role of WAA also began to
dwindle. In 1942, at the end of the
trial period, a faculty meeting
approved required physical edu-
cation, presumably because of
war time pressure for better con-
ditioning of potential draftees.
However the war has been over
for nearly nine years, and the new
program has not yet been inaugu-
rated.

WAA resembles male athletics

This leaves WAA in a position
like that of men’s athletics. But
without any pep club to cheer, or
any female Joe Howards or Ken
Stapleys to win newspaper space,

the Association stresses participa-
pation even more. There are three
levels to this participation. The
first is intercollegiate and intra-
mural, and operates through WAA
itself. The second is part of the
general women’s physical educa-
tion program, and is called in-
structional. This is open to stu-
dents, employees, and the faculty
of the University, and is required
only for pre-high school gradu-
ates. The third, also a part of the
general program, is scheduled rec-
reation under the supervision of
staff members.

Heading the whole 'women’s
physical education staff is Miss
Edith Ballwebber. Staff members

under her each specialize in two
or three sports or activities. Miss
Katherine Manning, a former
member of the Humphrey Weid-
man concert group, teaches mod-
ern and social dancing. Miss Nell
Eastburn instructs golf, bowling
and social dancing. Miss Martha
Kloo and Miss Shirley Thineman
also work with WAA. Hockey,
volleyball, swimming, badminton,
bowling, softball and tennis are
the sports the Association plays.
Besides the facilities in Ida Noyes,
women’s athletics uses the Mid-
way during the autumn, five ten-
nis courts on 60th St., a hockey
field and a golf green and ap-
proach.

Maroon track team wins

Midwest Invitational Meet

by Justin Johnson

The varsity track team ended a two-year reign of Wheaton College in the 15th Midwest
Invitational Track Meet, by winning at Naperville, Illinois, last Saturday in a heated con-
test which was not decided until the final relay. Final score was Chicago 55^, Wheaton
54^, Mankato 29, Loyola 28^, Ball State 201/>, Milwaukee 16Vis DePauw 101/,, and De-
Kalb 7. “

Chicago took only two firsts, but scored in all but one of the 12 events. Frank Loomos

continued his supremacy in the low hurdles, winning his specialty in :07.0, and Roger For-
sythe scored a surprise upset over defending champion Joe Howard in the shot put, throw-

ing 42' 4'' for his first major

victory.

It was truly a team victory
as the Maroons, running without
the aid of their graduate contin-
gent, did creditably in all events.
Loomos picked up a second in the
60-yd. dash and ran on the meet-
deciding 8-lap relay to lead Ma-
roon scorers with 11 points.

Shephard is team workhorse

Dave Shephard, team work-
horse, placed third in the dash,
third in the broad jump, fifth in
the lows, and ran on two Chicago
relays to contribute 10 V^ points
to the team cause. Dan Trifone
had his best effort of the year in
the high jump, soaring 5'10%"
to tie for first and also ran fourth
in the high hurdles.

In the distant events, Paul Bap-

tist finished strong to cop a third
in the two-mile, with Jim Flynn
adding a fifth in this event. Flynn,
was later to come back and get a
fifth in the mile, the point that
might well have decided the meet.

The only graduate student used
by the Maroons was Morgan Dam-
erow, trainer-for-the-day, who was
conspicious throughout the meet
running here and there giving aid
and comfort to the runners in
many invaluable ways. The vic-
tory served to answer those crit-
ics of the Chicago team who have
contended in the past that the
Maroon’s strength came primar-
ily from graduate students.

Stapley accepts trophy

Stapley, who accepted the team
trophy for Chicago, commented,
“We’ve beaten both Loyola and
Wheaton without the benefit of
our transfer students. I guess
they’ll have to think up some
other excuse, now, for our con-
sistent victories over them and
other opponents.”

Thus far this year, Chicago has
lost but one meet—to Marquette
University — while winning over
19 teams. This Saturday, the Ma-
