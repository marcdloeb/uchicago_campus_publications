Fermi wins $25,000
AEC special award

Enrico Fermi, Charles H. Swift distinguished service pro-
fessor in the department of physics and the institute for
nuclear studies, became the first winner Wednesday of a spe-
cial award of $25,000 from the Atomic Energy commission.

The award was presented to Fermi for his “especially meri-
torious contributions” in atomic energy.

Aiderman Merriam talks here,

possible candidate for mayor

Seeks support
for Kis views; no
party preference

Describing himself as an in-
dependent in Chicago politics,
Robert Merriam, aiderman
from the fifth ward, said Sunday:
“I have a great many policies
that I would like to incorporate
into the city government and I
always welcome the support of
anyone who holds similar views—
no matter what his party affilia-
tion. ... I wouldn’t object to run-
ning as a Republican if that party
shows an interest in my aims.”

He continued, “If I find that
enough individuals hold v i e wr s
similar to mine and desire that
I run for mayor to develop these
aims within our city government,
I would certainly consider doing
so.”

Merriam, who is being widely
discussed as a possible candidate
for mayor in the election next
year, was interviewed following
a lecture that he delivered at the
Calvert club last Sunday.

He said that members of both
the Republican party and the In-
dependent Voters of Illinois “have
approached me on this subject,
but there is nothing in any way
official.”

Runner Deike
makes his mark

Cross country star Walt Deike
broke his own varsity three and
four-mile records Wednesday in

one race.

He broke the
three-mile rec-
ord that he set
three weeks ago
against Wiscon-
sin state by nine
seconds, turning
15:21. Continu-
ing for a mile, he
still shaved four-
tenths of a sec-
ond off the rec-

Deike

ord he set Saturday against Wash-
ington U., winning in 20:33.

Deike also holds the varsity in-
door two-mile record of 9:19
which he set last February.

Flanders nods OK to
'amusing' soap-drive

Senator Flanders, replying to a request by Robin Hood’s Merrie
Men that he present signed soap-tags to the Senate, stated that “After
considering the matter, I think it would be wise for me under present

conditions not to engage in your
laudable campaign, but your un-
dertaking should still go on.”

Flanders wrote in regard to pro-
censure soap-tags which were
signed by 900 individual students
during a campus campaign initiat-
ed by the Robin Hood club to pre-

Aiderman Robert Merriam speaking to Leslie van Martes, chair-
man of the program committee of the Calvert club, Ralph Massey,
president of the group, and Father Connerton, advisor to the group.

Conservation of community is
schooVs obligation: Merriam

“The panic of people running to the suburbs is purely psy-
chological. ... In the Hyde Park area, this has slowed down to
a mere trickle,” said Robert Merriam in a lecture given at the
Calvert club last Sunday. Merriam, city council representative
from the fifth ward, which includes the University, spoke on

“Conserving our neighborhood.

“Middle areas are not so bad
that they can’t be saved, and
not so good that they can’t be
improved.” He added that the
Hyde Park-Kenwood communities
belong in this category.

“If UC had started ten years
ago to do what it is now doing
under Chancellor Kimpton, the
area would be in far better shape.
What University interest and ac-
tion there has been is quite effec-
tive. . . . The University should
have and must have a continuing
interest in the community since it
is part of that community.”

In ordet to compete with the
suburbs for citizens, the central
areas of the cities must eliminate
those evils which cause people to
move, Merriam claimed. The Hyde
Park Redevelopment project will
create adequate recreational
space, shopping facilities, and
parking space for the area. By
keeping through traffic off resi-
dential streets, quiet residential

vent a Senate whitewash of Mc-
Carthy.

At present the soap is being
sent to Senator Douglas. The Mer-
rie Men are urging him to speak
in favor of the censure and to de-
liver the tags to the Senate effec-
tively. They are also informing
Douglas of similar campaigns suc-
cessfully in progress at Wiscon-
sin, Hunter, Michigan and other
universities.

In his letter, Flanders also
wrote that "Your undertaking is
both amusing and serious. It is an
amusing method to serve a seri-
ous purpose.”

neighborhoods can be created. The
“road block” at Ingleside and 62nd
street is an experiment along that
line.

Private citizens and private in-
stitutions have obligations in
maintaining the neighborhood.
“Until recently, the University of
Chicago has not met these obliga-
tions," Merriam said.

Mendes-France changes style,
not French policy aims: Aron

by Alice Bloom

Pierre Mendes-France, the new premiere of France, represents a change in style of govern-
ment, not in actual policies, maintained Raymond Aron, professor in the Institute of political
science, University of Paris, and columnist for Le Figaro, in his lectures at Breasted hall,
Monday and Tuesday evenings.

His success has been due to extraordinary cleverness and favorable circumstances said
Aron. Mendes-France came to power at a time when there was a great popular demand for

an active government

The inactivity of the former
government had piled crisis
upon crisis; the accumulated
events called for decisive action.
“Mendes-France, who for 10 years
had said the government was
wrong, promised to find a solu-
tion to the mess, and the deputies
gave him a chance.”

His deadline agreement on Indo-
China at the Geneva conference
made him popular in France. On
EDC his previous non-committal
attitude to the problem placed him
in a maneuverable position. When
EDC failed to pass the assembly,
Mendes-France was able to offer
an alternative program.

“This was a return to the Amer-
ican plan of a German rearma-
ment, but with the protective
clauses of EDC. So, they used
the Brussels treaty which was
anti-Germany and added Germany
with a British agreement to keep
several divisions on the continent.

This pleased the U. S. because

there was German rearmament; Wednesday at the Shoreland hotel. Larry Sherman is chair*

France, because they got rid of
EDC; the British because they
were leading a united Europe.”

North Africa diverse

The North African question
now pending is diverse because
each protectorate presents a dif-
ferent nationalist problem. A de-
sire to return to the old Moslem
religious state plus a secular
movement to attain power is the
conflict in Morocco. In Algiers the
large and influential French popu-

Fermi, confined ill to his
home, declined immediate
comment until after he had re-
ceived formal notification of the
award.

Rear admiral Lewis L. Strauss,
chairman of the AEC, stated from
Washington that the award, au-
thorized in the Atomic Energy
act of 1954, would be accompanied
by a citation noting Fermi’s con-
tribution to basic neutron physics
and the achievement of “the con-

Arnold J. Toynbee to visit UC;
historian to discuss world unity

Arnold J. Toynbee, author of A Study of History, will speak
on “World unity and world history” at 2 p.m. Wednesday in
Mandel hall, under the auspices of the Committee on Social

Thought.

A Study of History, Toyn-
bee’s comprehensive analysis
of civilization, was completed this
year with the publicat'on of parts
6-13. The first volumes of Toyn-
bee’s interpretation of the flow of

Court hears Solomon case Monday,
constitutionality of law to be tested

The case of Solomon versus Student Government will be argued
before the student-faculty-administration court in an open session
Monday at 3:30 p.m. in law south.

Marcus Raskin, in his second quarter in the law school, will plead
the case of Fred Solomon, who received eight write-in votes in the
last SG election. The votes were disqualified on the basis of an SG
law which calls for no writing on the ballots.

“We’re not questioning interpretation; it is a matter of constitu-
tionality,” Solomon said.

Clark Kucheman, election and rules chairman of SG, and Eli Stein,
former chairman of the committee on recognized student organiza-
tions, will speak for SG as Raskin argues that the law breaks the
spirit of the Student Code.

lation is afraid of losing its
French citizenship. The assembly
is willing to grant autonomy to
Tunisia, but Tunisians are rebelli-
ously clamoring for full inde-
pendence.

What would happen if France
lost all her African holdings? Al-
though some feel it would be an
economic catastrophe, Aron felt
that too much value was placed
on protected economic markets.—
If negotiations fail, Mendes-
France will be held responsible
and if he yields too much in order
to obtain an agreement, he’ll lose
support. He is faced with a situa-
tion in which he has little freedom
of maneuver.

Eight compete for IF queen;

crown winner at annual hop

The annual UC Interfraternity ball will be held next

The ball is open only to fraternity

Fermi touched off the world’$
first controlled chain reaction in
1942 and had charge of the ad-
vanced physics division at the Lo?
Alamos, N. M., atomic bomb labo-
ratory during World War II. He
was the first man to bombard
uranium with neutrons and suc-
ceeded in splitting a uranium
atom in 1934.

Fermi’s experiments won him
the Nobel prize in 1938.

history appeared in 1934.

Two UC exchange students Newest Trustee wrote novel letters

to Frankfort chosen for ’55*’56

Jerome Carlin and James Camp were chosen yesterday
as the 1955-56 Student Government exchange students to

when alum chairman,- doubled gifts

by Allen danger

Frankfurt. An SG appointed
committee picked the success-
ful scholarship winners from a
group of eleven applicants.

Carlin is a PhD candidate in So-
ciology and Camp is a student in
the English department.

The scholarships are adminis-
tered by the Student Government.
Each year there is a reciprocal
exchange of two students between
Frankfort and UC. The German
students are granted free tuition
at UC. Various student organiza-
tions have cooperated in the p^t
in providing room and board mr

student-faculty-administration

the exchangees.

The selection board consisted of
William E. Scott, registrar and
assistant dean of students; Viola
Manderfeld, chairman of the col-
lege German staff, and Christian
W. Mackauer, associate professor
of history. Student board mem-
bers included Molly Felker Luns-
ford; George Stone, Interfraterni-
ty-cbuncil president; Clive Gray,
SG member and former exchange
student at Frankfort, and Ruth
and Wolf Hyderbrand, Frankfort
exchange students at UC.

Among alumni, Earle Ludgin, UC’s newest trustee, is known primarily as “the man who
wrote those letters.”	'

“Those letters” are solicitations for alumni contributions, which were sent to alumni dur-
ing Ludgin’s term as chairman of the board of the Alumni foundation. They were apparent-
ly instrumental in raising an alumni gift of over $400,000, almost double the previous high.

Some of the letters were sentimental, as in the instructions on “how to compute your

science be your guide. . . That
sound you hear is of a man tap-

typewriter. What is it worth to
you to stay his hand?”

Alumni response was instant

and overwhelmingly pleased, ac-
cording to Howard Mort, UC
alumni secretary. Not only did
contributions rise, but alumni
even wrote that though they had
sent in their contributions, they
wanted to get the rest of the let-

Many alumni waited until the last
moment to send their contribu-

sure they would get all of Lud-

Starting a second housing file is not the way to lick discrimination

Since the re-establishment of a Student Government
Hon-discriminatory housing file is currently being con-
sidered, it would be well to review the history of this
perennial campus controversy.

The administration maintains a housing file in the
registrar’s office which accepts listings from all land-
lords regardless of racial policy. In April 1952 SG passed
a bill providing that the University inform prospective
listers that it does not accept discriminatory listings, and
that a student team approved by the dean investigate
claims of discrimination among listers. This bill was
vetoed by Dean Strozier.

SG then passed a “compromise” bill establishing a sec-
ond housing file operated by students, which was to be
reviewed by the dean after six months, and if he was
satisfied that the SG file was “adequate” the administra-
tion would discontinue its own file. This file was estab-
lished in September 1952 and abolished the same Novem-
ber by a new SG. Now SG plans to revive this file.

So much for history. Now, what exactly is the purpose
of eliminating discrimination in a campus housing file?
There are two: first, it would make it easier for minority-

“adequate,” simply by not listing in it. In a competition
between an administration discriminatory file and a
SG non-discriminatory one, the former must win. And
if it does, how long will it be before the students are
again in a position to do anything about the housing file
situation?

Remember, the administration holds the ace—it will
be the judge of the adequacy of the SG file. There is no
telling how long it might be (if ever) before it is sat-
isfied and discontinues its own file. And this does not
meet the problem of NOW.

If SG sets up a competing file now, it would be a monu-
ment to the fact that we have failed, a formal acknowl-
edgement of the administration discriminatory file’s
right to exist.

It has been a long time since Strozier vetoed the orig-
inal bill to eliminate discrimination in its file, and the
reasons given then appeared rather feeble. It would be
very wrong for SG to set up a new file now, especially
before it had again made every possible effort to get
the administration to clean up its own house.

Polling at the booths: Note the privacy accorded to
prospective voters. N^te the meditative atmosphere.

SG should fix its electoral roof

group students to find a place to live. Second, it would
encourage landlords who cater to students to make a pol-
icy of accepting tenants regardless of race.

How can this latter be done? Clearly, by making it
economically unfeasible for landlords to discriminate.
If the average landlord can get tenants just as easily by
discriminating as not, he will discriminate. If he has
difficulty finding tenants because he cannot list on cam-
pus, he is likely to seriously reconsider his policy.

It should be clear, then, that, SG file or no, if dis-
criminatory landords have a file on campus in which
to list, we have failed in our purpose. Moreover, they
are likely to insure that the SG file does not become

Once there was a man who had a leak in his roof.
When it was raining it was too wet to climb a ladder and
fix the leak, and when it was dry, there was no need to.

...»

Once there was an SG which had faults in its election
law. When there was an election, things were too touchy
to tamper with the law. When the election was over,
everyone forgot about the faults.

The faults we mean are the rules pertaining to elec-
tioneering at the polls. The present law allows litera-
ture, candidates, and electioneering up to ten feet from
the polls. The advantages of this for the parties are
great. A winning smile, a pretty girl, a last minute sales
talk win votes, and votes win elections. Not that the

losing party does not electioneer also; it just does not
prove as effective. ^

Perhaps many people would not bother to vote at all
if they did not receive this last minute urging to evercise
their franchise . . . perhaps others would vote who do
not do so now because they prefer a secret ballot.

The greater good of the University Student Govern-
ment would be served, however, if voters concentrated
on the issues and the records, and not on the smiles, as
they cast their ballots. Voters need a private place at
which to mark ballots, with no candidates or party work-
ers watching.

Student Government should take advantage of the dry
spell to examine the leak and fix it.

NICKY’S

Finds “Enchanted” polished; well staged

The dress rehearsal of University Theatre’s The Enchanted last Wednesday night
very smooth indeed. The Giradoux play, presented in the round, gave ample evidence

was
that

Phillips, the new director, not only knows what he is doing but has complete control over the
cast.

This control was demonstrated not only in the actors’ mastery of their lines and their abil-
ity to maintain a steady pace throughout the performance, but in the groupings which were

artfully contrived to give the
appearance of a gradually
changing tableau, effective
from any part of the theatre.
This measure of success is usually
all any college theatre ever hopes
to attain.

The Enchanted, however, goes
beyond this, and the opportunities
which Phillips gave his cast to
demonstrate brilliance were fre-
quently capitalized on. A few
scenes come to mind at once: the
most touching is one in which
Omar Shapli, as the inspector,
awkwardly confesses his love for
Isabelle, played by Neva Fowler;

<
<

<

Jim Sherwood, as the doctor, in
the effectively understated scene
where he describes his role in life
as that of helping others make the
transition from one mood to an-
other; and most memorable of all,
Haym Bernsen as the ghost,
whose marvellous diction and un-
canny feeling for his role caused
him to dominate the cast when-
ever he appeared.

The real sparkplug of the
show, however, was George
Wellworth as the inspector, who
was not only exceedingly funny,
but acted as the pace setter and
coordinating element in the
group scenes where chaos could
easily have reigned, and to some
extent did.

Miss Fowler was not strong
enough to seize the initiative
from any of these performers,
which is just as well, since the
role might have been destroyed
had she done so. Her chief con-
tribution to the play was similar
to Wellworth’s, but less obvious,
in that she provided the necessary
credibility to the transition be-
tween the scenes of rowdy com-

edy and the ethereal dialogues
with the ghost.

One of the directorial toutties
most to PhiHip’s credit was the
little girls whose noise, bump-
tiousness, and all around girl-
ishness, gave the fullness of life
to the scenes in which they ap-
peared.

One of the chief differences be-
tween mediocrity and excellence
in this production was the tech-
nical proficiency of the crew. The
lighting of the show was absolute-
ly profesisonal, in the sense that
not only were brilliant effects
achieved, but they were not
achieved too often. The lighting
problem was particularly difficult
since the show is not played upon
the stage and the fixtures found
there are useless.

Another outstanding feature
of the show was the music from
the score of Francois Poulenc,
written particularly for the
play. The person responsible
for playing this nr'
cues than most of the actors
and never once hesitated to
meet them.

Appearing in “The Enchant-
ed” are George WeHworth, as
the inspector, and Fredrich
Hirsch, as the mayor.

The music itself was most en-
joyable, embodying a rather new
concept of using the leitmotif to
usher in the characters and to em-
phasize the action at the height of
a scene, a technique successfully
developed by films but rarely seen
on the stage. The costumes are in-
nocuous.

A word of advice to those who
plan to see the show, and that is
simply to arrive early enough to
get a seat on the stage, since from
here the lighting tricks are most
effective.

Thinclads take two more

by Paul Baptist

The lean and hungry UC harriers methodically blasted Washington University of St
Louis last Saturday and Bradley on Wednesday by identical scores of 15-48 to finish up the
varsity dual-meet season with a record of nine wins and one loss, five of these wins being
————————— scored via the shut-out route. “ —'

Booters beat Morton JC

Place 3rd in conference

Scoring twice in the second quarter and once in the final
frame, UC booters beat Morton Junior College at Cicero Sat-

urday, 3-1.

Left-inside John Godfrey
tallied first with a left foot
shot that crossed the goal
from the left and went in on the
right, drawing the goalie out of
position. Center-forward Roojan
Minasaganian scored a few min-
utes later on a shot from the left
side of the goal into the left cor-
ner of the goal that further befud-
dled the Morton goalkeeper.

Chicago scored again before
Morton put through their goal.
Godfrey broke past the center-
forward and kicked straight in
from about twenty yards. Mor-
ton’s goal came when a drowsy
Gerry Czamanske, lulled by con-
fidence in his own defense, awoke

too late to have a chance at a well
kicked goal. Coach Hermanson

sent Dick Hansen in at
then, to allow Czamanske
on the sideline.

The win gave Chicago a

goalie
a rest

tie for

third in Midwest conference play.

Greenlee hurt

Sam Greenlee, one of the
outstanding runners of the UC
cross country squad, was seri-
ously injured in an auto acci-
dent near Kankakee, Sunday.
Doctors in Veterans hospital,
303 Huron street, list his con-
dition as critical.

Greenlee entered UC this fall
after spending his undergradu-
ate days at Wisconsin. He
achieved distinction as a half-
miler there, but was also suc-
cessful at longer distances at
Wisconsin and, this fall, at UC.

Walt Deike, without a doubt
one of the finest distance men
in the country, won both races
handily,, setting new varsity rec-
ords for three and four miles in
the same race, 15:21 and 20:33,
respectively, and breaking in a
brand-new Bradley course with a
brilliant 13:40 which should stand
as a record for quite a while.

The snobby thinclads continued
their policy of non-fraternization
so effectively that Walt Deike,
Paul Baptist. Chuck Rhyne, Art
Omohundro, and Lowell
Hawkinson were spared the try-
ing sight of opposing school run-

ners finishing ahead of them in
either race, while Jim Flynn and
Sam Greenlee were relieved in
this manner in one race.

Tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Wash-
ington park the finest aggrega-
tion of distance runners in the
Middle West, headed (by Wait
Deike, "Cookie” Moriya, Lowell
Zellers, Hal Higdon. L a w 10 n
Lamb, and Phil Coleman, will
compete in an open five-mile race
sponsored by the UC Track Ciub.

Monday. Nov. 22, Baptist, Fish-
man, Lynn, Omohundro, and
Smothers will travel up to East
Lansing, Michigan, to run in the
NCAA crosscountry champion-
ship meet on the Michigan State
course.

Christmas skiers journey to Colorado

A Christmas ski trip to Arapa-
hoe Basin, Colorado, in the moun-
tains 70 miles west of Denver,
is being sponsored by the Outing
club.

The trip lasts from December
17 to January3, including 13 full
days of skiing. Cost is $95, which
includes transportation by char-
tered bus, food, lodging, and in-
surance.

those who are not proficient in
the art of skiing, as well as for
those who have never been on
skis before. Equipment may be
rented there.

Further information may be ob-
tained by calling Spense Wright,
MI 3-0800, extension 1072, be-
tween 6 and 10 p.m. any night but
