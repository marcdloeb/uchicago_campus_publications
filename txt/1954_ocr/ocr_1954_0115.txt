Enrollment down;
another 10% drop
from last figures

The enrollment figures released
by the Bursar's office the first
week of the Winter quarter indi-
cated a continuation of the down-
ward trend of enrollment. The
total number of students enrolled
in the University this Winter
quarter has decreased by 591 stu-
dents since the same quarter of
last year, a 10.7 per cent decrease.
The largest decrease is in the
first and second year College stu-
dents whose total enrollment is
now 202 compared with 283 last
year, a decrease of 81 students,
or 28.6 per cent. The third and
fourth year College students de-
creased by 78 enrollments or a
relatively small 8.5 per cent. The
entire college enrollment has de-
creased by 157 students or 13.1
per cent. The enrollment in the
college is now 1046 compared with
1203 a year ago.

In the Divisions the decline was
smaller. The total enrollment in
the Divisions dropped from 2456
to 2284, a decline of 172 students
or 7.0 per cent The largest drop
was in the Physical Sciences Divi-
sion; The Law School and the
Medical School were the only de-
partments reporting increases,
and these were small.

Student groups must register

All new student groups seeking recognition os student organizations
of the University of Chicago must register in the Student Activities
Office by Feb. 11, under the provisions of the Statute of the Student
Government and the Code of Student Regulations.

To secure and maintain recognition, an organization must complete
the registration forms issued by the Activities Office, and possess 10
or more members who ore students in good standing at the University.
Ail groups registered by Feb. 11 will be listed in the revised Student
Directory of the University. ALL GROUPS HAVING OBTAINED REC-
OGNITION IN PREVIOUS QUARTERS MUST REPORT QUARTERLY
CHANGES.

A student organization must secure recognition to use University
facilities such os rooms for meetings and bulletin boards.

SQ exchangees
to give reports

Last year's Student Govern-
ment exchange students in Yugo-
slavia and Germany, David Cum-
mings and Don Levine, will re-
port to the campus this coming
Wednesday, Jan. 20, on one phase
of their experiences abroad. They
will talk on “Collective Agricul-
ture in Yugoslavia, Israel, and
East Germany,” beginning at 4:30
in Law South.

Cummings, a student in the UC
economics department, spent last
year in Zagreb. Yugoslavia, study-
ing various phases of the Yugo-
slavian economy. During his stay
he traveled around all six repub-
lics of the country, often hitching
rides with peasants driving their
ox-carts.

Levine, a student of sociology,
studied at Frankfurt during
the academic year. In addition
he worked among refugees from
East Germany during a three
month period in Berlin, and visit-
ed Israel last spring, staying for
several weeks on a kibbutz.

The speakers will be introduced
by Clive Gray. SG president, who
himself was an exchange student
at Frankfurt two years ago.

Combine OMP-NS 3
in new-form degree

The College has announced the
creation of a new course for stu-
dents enrolled in the joint College
—Division of Biological Sciences
BS program. The course, a com-
bination of OMP and Nat. Sci. 3
(biological) will be counted as
satisfying the requirements of
both courses. The grade received
in the combined course will be re-
corded for both courses.

The course, utilizing both OMP
and Nat. Sci. materials, will meet
four hours a week beginning in
the autumn quarter. For students
currently enrolled in OMP, the
course is being offered during
this quarter and the Spring quar-
ter.

According to Benson Ginsburg,
chairman of natural sciences in
the College, who will teach the
course this year, students will read
approximately naif of the regular
OMP readings for the Winter and
Spring quarters and will take a
part of the OMP comprehensive
examination. In addition, each
student will write a preceptorial
paper on some topic in the area of
the natural sciences and will read
materials connected with his top-
ic. The paper, according to Gins-
burg, will be writen as “an OMP
treatment of a Nat. Sci. 3 prob-
lem.”

Ornella Santoliquido and Massine Amfitheatrof, of the Duo do Roma,
will perform tonight at 8:30 p.m., in Mandel Hall.

Fraternity upholds discriminatory clause;
Phi Delta will not oppose national order

SG offers new pion
rejected by fraternity

“The Illinois Beta chapter of Phi Delta Theta will not under any circumstances re-
nounce their discriminatory clause, since they have a prior moral commitment to their
national fraternity,” said Elliot King, representing that fraternity at an open hearing
on the Michigan plan held by Student Government last Wednesday.

He also said that they would not support a move to force them to go local. King felt

that the fraternity would support “consistant change, rather than abrupt upheaval.”

by Mitchell Slein

At the first meeting of the Student Faculty Communica-
tions Board, held Friday, Jan. 4, the members of the Commit-
tee on Recognized Student Organizations of Student Govern-

“The primary objective of
the Illinois Beta chapter is not
the elimination of discrimina-
tion in the local chapter, but rath-
er its elimination on an interna-
tional level,” declared King.

Suspended diopters not supported

When asked if the UC chapter
would support the Amhurst and
Williams chapters which have
renounced the discriminatory
clause and have been suspended,
King, speaking for himself, said
that he did not think that the
chapter would support the sus-
pended chapters unless they re-
canted.

King went on to say that the
fraternity position is essentially
the same as it has always been.
He said, in effect, that the chap-
ter at UC feels that they can not
violate the constitution of the na-
tional organization of which they
are a part; that they will not
withdraw from the national order
and will not admit that SG has
jurisdiction in this area.

Questioning session

In a questioning session which
followed his original statement,
King gave the following answers.
(Questions and answers are para-
phrased, but contain full meaning
and implication)

Q: Will you admit that SG has
jurisdiction of recognition?

A: We will not take a position,
either for or against.

Q: What ar^ the chances of ob-
taining the necessary three-
fourths vote to repeal the present
•iause?

A: We cannot reveal fraternity
business. We have, however, at-
tempted to cooperate through

hearings of the Michigan Plan.

statements, etc. We cannot do
more. Also note that most of our
chapters are in the North and
Northwest, and that they support
the amendment.

Q: Do you think that if Am-
hurst and Williams are not ex-
pelled that it will, in effect, make
the rule null and void?

A: We would not agree that if
Amhurst and Williams were not
expelled, it would harm the rule.

Q: When do you think that you
will be able to secure the end of
selectivity clause?

A: The end of the selectivity
clause may come in 1954 or 1956.

Several campus groups and in-
dividuals rose to speak, either in
favor of or against the amend-
ment. Those supporting the
amendment were Bob Baumark

of Alpha Delta Phi (speaking for
himself) and Phi Delta Theta.
Those speaking against, were the
Documentary Film Group, the
Young Democrats, SRP, Fran
Oshlag, President of Kelly House,
(speaking for herself). Gil Dahl-
berg, .President of Inter-Frater-
nity Council, questioned the legal-
ity of the entire proceeding.

vaccine against influenza are
urged to come to Students Health
Service os soon os possible. The

Phi Delta Theta fraternity on
the SG granting another year’s
Theta fraternity has failed to com-
ply with the ruling to the satis-
faction of SG.

Chapter opposes clause

Phi Delta Theata, represented
by its president, Al Keisker, then
said that the chapter “has been
working off and on in the Na-
tional Organization for the end of
the discriminatory clause.” Keis-
ker said that the fraternity is over
one hundred years old, but that
the “selective clause” was only
added about the first World War
when people of other races and
religions began coming to colleges
in greater numbers. However, he
added, there has. been a change in
the attitudes of the country as a
whole since World War II.

When asked what the fraternity
has been doing with respect to the
Michigan Plan, Keisker noted that
they had brought up a motion to
strike the clause at the fraternity
conventions of 1948, 1950, and
1952. In 1948, the motion did not
reach the floor; in 1950 it re-
ceived a vote of 40 per cent; and
in 1952, because the 80-85 per cent
who supported the motion could
not agree on extent of the rulings
the motion received only 60-65 per
cent of the vote. In order to
change the Phi Delta Theta con-
stitution, a three-fourths vote for
two consecutive conventions (held
bi-annually) is needed.

Change is possible

In asking that its position be
considered, the Phi Delta Theta’#
stated further than one-fourth of
the chapters are in the soutl\
which presents another obstacle
Furthermore the fraternity men
noted, the members of the nation
al organization are business men

So« “SG," ^1 #

ment offered a compromise to
the Michigan Plan.

The compromise consisted of
extension to the fraternity so
that they may strive to rid
themselves of their “selectiv-
ity Clause” at their next national
convention. In return for the
grant of one year, SG is asking
Phi Delta Theta to assure them
that the local UC chapter will
then renounce the discriminatory
clause no matter what happens at
the national convention. As of last
Wednesday, the fraternity would
not agree to this compromise.

Strozier denies approval

The meeting of the SFCB was
held in the offices of dean of stu-
dents, Robert M. Strozier. Stroz-
ier denied that the administration
had ever given its approval to the
Michigan Plan. However Eli Stein,
chairman of CORSO, stated that
Strozier did not veto the bill at
the time of its passage and it is
printed in the “Student Code and
Regulations,” published by the
Dean’s office.

The SFCC, which is composed
of members of Student Govern-
ment, interested student groups,
faculty and administration mem-
bers, met to recommend to all in-
terested parties, a workable solu-
tion to the problem of carrying
out the Michigan Plan. The board
has no power to pass resolutions
and its recommendations are not
binding.

Eli Stein (ISL-PHY-SCI) out-
lined the history of the Michigan
Plan at UC. He noted that the plan
was first adopted by SG in 1951
and that student organizations
were give none year to comply
with the ruling, with a provision
for a one year extension. The year
ended last October. He further
noted that only the Phi Delta

Win legal trophy

Called on to test their legal skill in a case involving the
Fifth Amendment, a UC Law School student team won a silver
cup for the best “brief,” and then argued its way close to the
national inter-law school championship before a moot U.S.
Supreme Court in New York on Dec. 18.

“Which of your fellow members of the faculty are members

of the Communist Party? Are
you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist
Party? Have you recently attend-
ed any meetings of local Commu-
nist organizations?” In the fic-
titious case created for the com-
petition, these questions were
asked of a professor by a congres-
sional investigating committee.
He declined to answer and was
tired.

Legal battles last two days

This case was disputed by a
series of legal bouts between the
contending schools over a two
day period. Marvin Stender, Har-
old Ward and Paul Wenger, win-
ners of the Ill.-Wisc.-Ind. regional
championship for UC. reached the
semi-finals before losing a deci-
sion to the Georgetown team.

Georgetown then lost to the new-
ly crowned champions from the
U. of Nebraska.

Each team was expected to be
able to represent either side of
the case, since the judges, ap-
pointed by the N. Y. Bar Associa-
tion, were to pass only on the le-
gal abilities of the teams and not
on the questions involved.

Views of military affairs evaluated;
Pettee gives own analysis in lectures

• “It is time to

take a careful look at the cliches which have so long persisted about what’s

wrong or right with the military. The cold war, conditions of world-wide tension, eco-
nomic strain, and Korea in particular — all the present stresses — have brought back to
us a sense of military urgency and make necessary a new approach toward military affairs.**

So spoke George S. Pettee,
deputy director of the Opera-
tions Research Office at John
Hopkins University, in the first
two of a series of six public lec-
tures presented by the Walgreen
Foundation. The lecture series
will continue today and next Mon-
day, Wednesday, and Friday in
Social Sciences 122 at 4:30 p.m.

Pettee rejected many of the
“cliches in traditional views of
military affairs,” treating such of
them as “The army is aggressive
and necessarily dangerous” with

er reasons and through invalid‘statements, for example, that mil-

that present conditions give added
weight to military matters, be-

tion. This highlighting of the mili-
tary, he said, makes correct
knowledge of the .workings of
military affairs vital.

Military is individuals

In place of the traditional views
of the army, Pettee offered, “I do
not see the army as ‘bad’; military
affairs is a process, made living
by the actions of real people, and
there are problems arising from
the interactions of groups of these
people.” His first two lectures
were occupied with an analysis of
the nature of these groups—i.e., a
who’s who of soldiers, civilians,
and politicians.

All three groups, said Pettee,
are bound together in service to
the state by a sense of duty. It is

Literary Chinese has devilish fascination

Says Qreel in series on Chinese civilization

“Literary Chinese has a devilish fascination shared by no other language — including
Tibetan and Sanscrit,” H. G. Creel, professor of early Chinese language and literature,
told a good-sized audience in Social Sciences 122 last Tuesday night. The lecture, “The
Chinese Language,” was the first in the series “Aspects of Chinese Civilzation” being

sponsored by the Committee
on Far Eastern Civilizations.

Spoken Chinese, as opposed to
literary Chinese, is quite easily
learned, Creel explained. There
are many dialects, but since three-
quarters of them are variations
of the Mandarin dialect, mutual
wnintelligibility is exaggerated.

Pekin# dialect is standard Chinese

The spoken language, taking
the Pekin dialect as the standard,
like Parisian French, has only 300
monosyllables, increased to 1,200
by the use of the four tones, which
express 40,000 characters and
more than 40,000 ideas.

“Number and tense are not as
important as we think,” Creel
pointed out. Chinese is a complete-
ly uninflected language, but “I
see he tomorrow” is fully as ade-
quate as “I will see him tomor-

row.” Word order in this sort of
set-up is important, but not in-
variable.

Prose is poetic

“Reading and writing Chinese
is an adventurous process,” Creel
went on. “One character can be
translated so that a word will be
a noun, verb, adverb, or adjective,
and all are correct. This pliability
means that characters can be
mixed and interpreted as the writ-
er fancies.” The prose has a struc-
tural pattern, similar to our
poetry; the style is condensed and
allusive, often involving “contrap-
untal” meanings.

“ For centuries the only road to

fame, wealth, and power lay
through government service,”
sail Creel. The qualifying exams
required the art of writing, which
consequently reached a high form.
“When a simplified writing was
introduced during this century,
even the peasants were suspici-
ous, wanting to know if this was
the language of the scholars.”

Frankfurt scholarship

'Wash' Prom goes campus-wide

blanks at Reynolds Club

Application forms for two Student Government exchange
scholarships to the University of Frankfurt, Germany, may
be picked up at the Reynolds Club desk starting today. The
scholarships will be in effect for the 1954-55 academic year
at Frankfurt, and include free tuition, room, and board, for

successful applicants.

Applications should be filled
out by noon on Friday, Jan.
29. A selection board consist-
ing of faculty, administration and
student members will choose two
applicants during the first week
in February, basing its decision
on the academic ability, purpose
in applying for the scholarships,
student activities record, and Ger-
man language ability of the ap-
plicants. Students in the College
and all departments and schools
of the University are eligible to
apply; successful applicants may
also request Fulbright travel
grants from the US Government.
History of program

The Frankfurt. exchange pro-
gram was inaugurated in 1951-52
by the student governments of
both universities as a means of
furthering international under-
standing on a student level. Nego-
tiations for the program were
founded on the already existent
cooperation between Chicago and
Frankfurt as "sister universities”

their tuition. At the same time
one UC’er, Don Levine, took up
his studies at Frankfurt. Now two
•Frankfurt students, Edgar Win-
demuth and Kai Von Heeringen,
are in the UC humanities division
and political department, while
three UC’ers are studying at the
expense of the University of
Frankfurt at the German uiver-
sity. The Student Government
coninues to manage and, in coop-
eration with the UC Inter-Frater-
nity Council, to finance the Chi-
cago side of the exchange.

Information

Students who wish more infor-
mation on conditions at the Uni-
versity of Frankfurt are invited
to contact Clive Gray, SG presi-
dent who was in Frankfurt to be-
gin the program in 1952, or Don
Levine, last year’s exchangee,
and any of the three Frankfurt
exchangees now on campus, in-

exchangee of last year who is
continuing at the University.

Wash Prom will have a new look this year. Instead of being sponsored by Student Union alone, as in the past,
organisations from all parts of the campus including the Interdormitory Council and most of the fraternities wiH
join in presenting the annual formal dance this year. Presiding at the organizational meeting at Ida Noyes last
Friday was Student Union president Bruce Larkin. Between 35 and 40 representatives of the various sponsoring or-
ganizations were at the meeting and preliminary committee talks were begun. Shown above is Al Gruber, SU dance
chairman, who is in charge of Wash Prom preparations, speaking at the meeting.

education. Ex-Chancellor Hutch-

when he launched a professorial
exchange that has continued up
to the present. But no attempt
had been made to exchange stu-

Student Government at UC made
the proposal to Frankfurt’s STA
(General Students’ Committee) in
1951.

Last year two Frankfurt stu-

Frats' rushing begins Monday,
smokers scheduled next week

The two weeks of official college rushing will be from Monday, Jan. 18, to Friday, Jan. 29.
The period is set aside for the purpose of introducing the University of Chicago fraternities
to college students.

During this two week period each fraternity will have two “rushing smokers.” Invitations
are sent to as many men as possible, but not everyone gets an invitation to every fraternity
because of various mechanical difficulties in mailing. These smokers, however, are open

JIMMY’S

because

houses, according to Gil Dahl-
berg, Inter-Fraternity Council
president. Everyone has a
standing invitation to attend every
smoker.

Everyone invited

No obligation is incurred in at-
tending these smokers. Men who
have no interest in joining a fra-
ternity, but just want to see what
goes on inside a fraternity house,
or who want to talk with some
members, are cordially invited to
attend.

Men interested in joining a fra-
ternity should visit as many dif-
ferent houses as possible, Dahl-
berg pointed out.

Student beaten, robbed
flees 'professional thugs'

Beaten and robbed on Harrison street near Racine after
escorting his date home, Robert Gryfinski, a student in the
Social Sciences, lost approximately $95 to two thugs he could
not identify. The attack occurred at 12:15 a.m. on Jan. 6,
while Gryfinski was waiting for a bus.

He said that while he was standing on the street corner, a

car with three men drove up,
and that the men asked about
directions. Becoming suspi-
cious, he continued, he began to
walk away from the car. It was
then that two of the men got out
of the car, chased him, threw him
to the ground and beat him. The
men then fled, taking his watch,
wallet, briefcase, and hat. The

I

value of these articles was placed
by Gryfinski at about $95.00.

In Gryfinski’s opinion, the men
who carried out the attack were
professional thugs. They were
young, but he could give no fur-
ther details as to their identifica-
tion since he could not see too
well. He emphasized that he could
see no reason for the attack.

Gryfinski made special mention
of the fact that the police were
very slow in responding to the
general alarm which he turned in.
He noted that it took at least ten
minutes for a squad car to arrive
on the scene.

“After all,” he said, "this is the
second time I have been attacked
since last August.” The previous
attack took place on 22nd St. near

'Practice what you preach'

' : We were highly gratified to read Chancellor Kimpton’s
speech to the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity on the problem of
racial segregation. The Chancellor said: “The University is
dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a community

? upon an unsegregated, inter-racial basis. We view the policy
of racial segregation as not only illegal but bankrupt and
fruitless . . . “

The Administration and the Student Government are
facing the problem of implementing the Michigan Plan with
.regard to the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which has not
; removed .its discriminatory clause from its constitution. To
date the Administration's stand has been ambiguous. But
Kimpton’s statement makes us hopeful that the University
will face this problem resolutely, and in a manner consonant
with its traditional policies.

We hope that Hie stand the University will take will give,
real meaning to Kimpton’s statement, and that the campus
will not be disappointed by the decision which must be made
by the Administration hi the way near future.

SG, at its Tuesday night meeting, discussed the Michigan Plan, a plan to.
suspend campus organizations which have discriminatory clauses in their cons
stitutions. All business concerning the Phi Delta Theta fraternity has been post-
poned until the following student government meeting next Wednesday.

The issue was postponed until negotiations between Robert W. Strozier, dean
of students, and CORSO are completed. The question of the recognition of Beta

Theta Pi was also tabled, since
it is believed that the frater-
nity has not yet submitted
information to CORSO concerning
its discriminatory clauses.

The Student Government, representing 4,600 students of
the University of Chicago, is very much interested in certain
proposals now before your Committee regarding the deduction
of necessary educational expenses from taxable income.

It is no secret that many Americans are prevented from
attending educational institutions because a heavy income
tax is levied on that part of their or their parents' earnings
which would finance their studies at a college or university.
Since 1945 the sharp rise in educational costs, reflected in
tuition increases of more than 100% at the major private
institutions, has severely aggravated the situation.

The Student Government therefore believes that the deduc-
tion of necessary educational expenses from taxable income
would be an important relief, and it urges the Ways and Means
Committee to give this move serious consideration. A pro-
vision for such a deduction would put higher education within
the reach of many persons who cannot now afford it, and hence
serve the interests of the entire nation.

Doshisha University students UC DADA group goes gaga

send embroidered emblems

by Peter Greene

At a recent interview with the vice-president of DADA, the following information M as
obtained about this student organization. DADA has many enthusiastic members, all of
whom are president. All non-members are president ex-officio.

DADA was first formed at UC by a close personal friend of Harold Ickes. At this time,
owing to unperceived circumstances, there was no regular mail, and all communication was
effected by means of parcel post

Photo by Joe Wolf

Deon of Students Robert M. Strozier exhibited the embroidered emblems
made by the Doshisha University students in Kyoto, Japan. Before World
War II, the baseball team mode biennial visits to Japan, and Doshisha was
•ne of the schools UC played. The mementoes, which were presented to
Strozier by the Reverend Fumio Yamamoto of the Chicago Theological Sem-
inary, were done with intricate care; the University seal made by hand in
gold thread.

When you grip the wheel of an Air Force jet, your hands are on a fast,

it seemed unlikely, and neverthe-

that some absolute change might
be made.

And at that time did a boy
throw a stone at him to make an

made of two atoms of astral sub-
stance and one of cardboard.. It
is very dangerous. Yet there is
still a gap in his encyclopedic for-
mula.

Enriching the past, and to help
the others, he has prepared the
following lyric manifesto:

Iodized! Terrific!

“Dada is a new suit and fair
words. It has this concrete immo-
lence. Independency. Breaking
chain stores together!

“It’s a simple thing—intonation
and induction of steel products,
chemically compounded, scientifi-
cally blended, electrically timed
to the utmost efficiency, to pur-
pose using it; beneficial both me-

dicinally and commercially. Some-
thing new by its very complexity.

“We experience novelties in all
domains. I love wasps because we
kill them. The sky is made of 80
per cent blue nylon, a fabric of
pure fabrication, a piece of end-
ing, a falling moss, Grant’s Tomb.
Why does the sun come up? (Be-
cause it’s a gas.) Just lazy, I
guess.

“Jefferson is so well understood
today, with nickels over a wide
area. I shall now relate further
what the soldiers have done to
me.

“Business walks as usual.”

Sponsor bridge meet

Student Union is sponsoring a
duplicate bridge tournament at Ida
Noyes Hall on January 20 and 27.
Bridge enthusiasts who hold no

any fraction of a point may ploy

Propose new
teacher plan

A new program for graduates
of Chicago High schools who wish
to teach in the Chicago school
system has been planned by the
University Committee on Prepara-
tion of Teachers, cooperating with
the Office of the Superintendent
of High Schools, Thaddeus J. Lub-
era. The chairman of the Commit-
tee, F. Champion Ward, Dean of
the College, made the formal an-
nouncement last week, expressing
at the same time the hope that
scholarships may be made avail-
able for prospective teachers
through the Superintendent’s of-
fice and the University.

Under this program, which the
University pians to open to 150
aspirants next Fall, students may
complete their courses in educa-
tion during the last two years of
their college work, receive their
Bachelor’s degrees and secure
"temporary” teaching certificates
while preparing for their Master’s
degrees.

The Committee on Teacher
Preparation, which replaces the
committee formed with Carnegie
Foundation funds when ,the
School of Education was dis-
solved, has received a grant from
the Ford Foundation’s Committee
for the Advancement of Educa-
tio this year, and an assurance
of another grant for next year.

Chamber groups, lutenist to appear

The University Concerts winter quarter4series will open tonight at 8:30 p.m. The concert will be given
by the Duo di Roma—Massino Amfitreatrof, violoncello, and Ornella Santoliquido, piano. Miss Santo-
liquido, who teaches at the Academy of Santa Cecelia in Rome, is a prominent Italian pianist. Both instru-
mentalists were originally members of the Virtuosi di Roma, a chamber group which toured the United
States in 1950.

Their program for tonight
will consist of the Brahms
Sonata in F-major, Opus 99; Bee-
thoven’s Sonata, Opus 111, for
Piano; Variations of a Rococo
Theme, Opus 33 by Chaikovsky;
Ernest Bloch’s Prayer; and Scott’s
Pastoral Reel.

The University of Chicago Choir
and members of the Chicago Sym-
phony Orchestra, under the direc-
tion of Richard Vikstrom, will pre-
sent the concert on January 29.
Their program will survey the
concert form of the liturgical
mass, as it developed from the
period when vocal polyphony was
at its height, to the present time.

In Ecclesiis, a mass by Giovanni
Gabrielli, represents the pomp and
splendor of Venetian codrt music
of the early seventeenth century.
The Mass for Five Voices, by Wil-
liam Byrd, exhibits the a cappella
style of the Tudor period. Stravin-
sky’s Mass is based on medieval
music, while Nadia Bolan ger’s
Psalm XXIV, though borrowing
the form of medieval Gregorian
chant, achieves modernity in its
dramatic manner and rhythmic
brilliance.

Suzanne Bloch, scheduled for
February 12, will sing early songs
to the accompaniment of her lute

Suzanne Bloch

and will play other instruments
(the recorder and virginal) of the
Renaissance period. Miss Bloch,
daughter of Ernest Bloch, the com-
pocer, is the best known concert
lutenist in this country.

The Vegh String Quartet,
which has won first prize at the
International Music Competi-
tion held in Geneva in 1946, and
has l>een well received at major
music festivals throughout Eu-
rope, is to perform February
26. The group, whose native city
is Budapest, is touring America
for the first time. They will play
the Beethoven E-flat quartet,
opus 127; Bartok’s fourth quar-
tet, and the Brahms C-minor
quartet, opus 51, No. 1.

In the spring quarter the Uni-
versity Concerts will begin April
9 with the Walden String Quartet,

Doc film to present Qerman film
including ‘Sunrise’, ‘Variety’

by Frank G. Temenyi

The Documentary Film Group will begin Its Film Study
with Variety, the first film on a series entitled “The German

_ Style: IV.” The series is im-
portant in that interest is focused on understanding the complex structure of the German
film, rather than viewing them as pathological symptoms.

Variety, made in 1925, came at the culmination of the most fruitful period of German
cinema. Made for UFA it commanded the best resources of the then highly developed
German film industry. Among

the well known figures were
the brilliant actor, Emil Jan-
nings, and the cameraman, Karl
Freund. E. A. DuPont, the direc-
tor, found their talents particular-
ly suited to develop his concep-
tion: to show the intense and hor-
rible emotions developing among
three performers in a sordid vau-
deville show. The film developed
highly subjective subject matter
in an extremely realistic manner.

Sunrise, to be shown on Jan.

22, was made in America in 1927

by Friedrich W. Murnau, and
shows great change from his
previous works such as The
Last Laugh. However, this is in
the nature of development on
Murnau’s part rather than an
American influence. In The
Last Laugh he had concentrated
on the development of charac-
ter, but Sunrise is structed in
terms of a syni phony of moods.
Carl Mayer, who had done much
brilliant work for the German
cinema created the script. Par-
ticularly convincing and mys-
terious is a sequence on life in
the modern metropolis.

The third major film of the se-
ries, M, is made in an idiom that
is quite widely used in Hollywood
today. M, directed by Fritz Lang,
was made in 1931. Essentially, it
is a form of detective story de-
veloped in a documentary style.
The film is built around the hunt-
ing down of a pathological mur-
derer by the police, and by the
underworld, whose activities were
being hampered by the search.
These lines of activity give rise to
an exciting and ironic climax.
Feter Lorre as ♦ he murderer gives
one of the finest performances of
his career.

The series also includes two
amusing experimental films:

who will present works by Carter,
Walton and Kodaly. They will be
followed by the New Art Wind
Quintet, April 23, in a program of
Reicha, Rossini and Fine. The
final concert is May 7, and will
present Sybil Shearer in a dance
recital. Her program has not been
announced.

First major folk-music in recent years

to feature Pete Seeger, 'Big Bilf Broonzy

Pete Seeger, the lanky five-string-banjo picker, and Big Bill Broonzy, Arkansas-born
blues guitarist, will be the principals in UC’s first major folk-music concert in recent years,
in Mandel Hall Jan. 30.

Seeger, a native of New England, left school in 1939 to begin a trek across the U.S.
to learn the “lost art” of folk banjo playing. Riding the rods with the Okie balladeer, Woody
Guthrie, he learned picking techniques from banjo - playing Tennessee farmers, Louisiana
boatmen, and Kansas plainsmen. He has piayed for union meetings, recorded sides for

the Library of Congress, put out
hundreds of commercial record-
ings, played in theatres, on cam-
puses, and in rallies from cost to
coast. In recent years he brought
folk music into the popular field
as kingpin of the “Weavers,” and
made a documentary film on folk
music, “To Hear My Banjo Play.”

Big Bill Broonzy is a blues gui-
tarist in the Blind “Lemon” Jef-
ferson tradition. He learned his
music on the streets of Little

Ghosts Before Breakfast, made
by Hans Richter, and Hands by
Stella Simon.

Admission to the series is by
a series ticket. The admission
to the entire series is $1.00, tax
included. Showings are on Fri-
day in S.S. 122, at 7:15 and 9:30

Peter Lorre in

UT to produce
drama by Synge

Playboy of the Western
World by John M. Synge was
announced this week as Uni-
versity Theatre’s major produc-
tion for the Winter Quarter. The
play is scheduled for Mandel Hall
the weekend of February 19, 20,
and 21. Playboy will mark Univer-
sity Theatre’s first venture into
the drama of the Irish theatre.

Synge is perhaps the best known
of the small group of playwrights
who, with W. B. Yeats, joined to
lend their strength to the found-
ing of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin.
Critics have praised the Playboy
as a masterpiece by the artist who
produced Riders to the Sea, In the
Shadow of the Glen, and Deirdre
of the Sorrows. Synge, Yeats,
Sean O’Casey, and Lady Gregory,
with their reawakened Irish na-
tionalism, their insistence on the
values of folk-culture and the
strong poetry of the native Irish
tongue, formed what might be
called the last clearly defined
“school” of English drama.

A recently announced change
in administration policy has now
made it possible for University,
Theatre to extend membership to
persons not immediately regis-
tered as students. This ruling is
expected to expand the Theatre’s
sources of available manpower
and to help bring together wide-
spread theatre talents and
energies.

Stanley Kazdailis, designer for
The Caucasian Chalk Circle and
Leonce and Lena of last season,
has been engaged to design the
play’s setting.

Forbid pistols, Victory string becomes Maroon paradox

club competes basketball'ers drub Aurora for fourth win

in rifle match

Despite its name, the UC
Rifle and Pistol Club indulges
in no pistol shooting. Sidearms
are forbidden .because the Field-
house range where members of
this student organization prac-
tices has thin sidewalls which can-
not withstand the impact of a
pistol bullet. •

Nevertheless, the Rifle and Pis-
tol Club maintains a full schedule
of activity, drawing from its mem-
bership an intercollegiate rifle
team which competes with squads
from other universities. As a
< member of the Midway Rifle
League, it also fires bi-weekly
matches with other rifle clubs in
the Chicago area.

Riders top 5th Army

In its most recent match the
club defeated a team representing
the US 5th Army by a score of
1276-884. Roger Kelley was top
shooter with 275 and Dave Karch-
er followed three points behind.
Schools scheduled for future com-
petition are Knox College, Col-
orado A&M, New Mexico Military
Institute and the University of
Connecticut. The Rifle and Pistol
Club has also entered a team in
the 1954 inter-collegiate competi-

What changes a year can bring! ’ . '

At this time last year the Maroon basketball team was in the midst of a 45-game losing streak, broken
only at long last by a giant pep rally, torchlight parade, cheerleaders and a brass-band. The torchlight pa-
rade and the giant pep rally linger only as a memory of winter exuberance and the sight of the Director
of Student Activities in a

new and unusual position,
but the cheerleaders garbed
in white sweaters and the
brass band still in imperfect
rhythm remain, and—strangest
of all paradoxes—the Chicago
basketball team is winning with
regularity!

It became a mater of pride to
UC students. Tired and angered
by the jokes and jibes which
sportswriters whose daily diet
was Notre Dame and Michigan
State hurled at the University’s
athletic prowess, the students re-
acted and supported their team
by encouraging attendance ahd
giving the players a cheer and a
pat on the back now and then.
Their efforts have wrought re-
sults: the Maroons at present
have a record of four triumphs in
five starts, losing to the only
team they defeated last year.

Maroons top Aurora

Wednesday the Maroons de-
feated the Spartans of Aurora
College by a score of 70-65. Sink-
ing the first basket, the team
never trailed, although at mo-
ments in the third and last quar-
ters the lead dwindled to within
a field goal and sometimes ap-
peared as if it might vanish any
moment. But alert backboard play
by Fred Hubbard and some excel-
lent shooting by Bob Mann paved
the way for the Maroon triumph.
When the Spartans’ star player
and game’s high scorer, Doug

Loyola sweeps
swim meet, 59-21

Loyola swimmers swamped the
Maroons in Bartlett Pool last Fri-
day. 59-21. Only winners for Chi-
cago were Lance Felker in the
200 yd. breast stroke and the 300
yd. medley relay team of Robert
Giedt. Roy Porterfield and Felker.

Loub, fouled out in the final quar-
ter, victory was assured. As usual,
the Maroons were weak on foul
shots, losing many points with
inaccurate free throws.

In their previous three contests
the Maroons played a fast game,
in each instance scoring heavily
in teh third quarter. Against two
teams these third period outbursts
provided the margin of victory,
but in the Navy Pier contest even
the most startling play could not
have liquidated the total deficien-
cy of field goals in the preceding
quarter.

Professional Schools second victim

On Dec. 8 Chicago played
host to the Illinois Professional
Schols and defeated them 57-46.
A cheering crowd watched the
Maroons take an early lead, held
at both the quarter and half by a
scant three points as Bob Mann,
the game’s high scorer, paced the
action. In the second half the
Maroons played more consistently
and stretched their lead to the
final eleven points. Although in
this match as in the following con-
tests, the team’s playing was
much improved over their original
combat with George Williams
College, foul shooting remained
the thorn in the Maroon’s side.

Four days later the Illini from
Navy Pier were given a cocky wel-
come at the Fieldhouse, but the
Maroons were perhaps a bit too
self-assured for the Pier avenged
their last year’s loss with a 56-48
drubbing. Despite the large crowd,
the team had difficulty getting
started an deven a 20 point burst
led by Mann and Dave Smith in
the third quarter could not placate
the effects of a second period de-
void of field goals.

Third quarter tallies win game

Concordia College in River
Forest became the Maroons’ third
victim of the season on Dec. 16.

through again in the third period,
scoring 22 points, and held this
lead to achieve the ultimate tri-
umph of 60-57.

Tomorrow night the Maroons

Loomis sets new
low hurdle record

Franklin Loomis set a new
varsity 'record when he ran
the 70-yard low hurdles in 7.9
a the First Annual Holiday Track
Meet. Over 100 trackmen from 20
schools participated in the event
which the UC Track Club spon-
sored last January 2.

Loomis also placed third in the
high hurdles while Maroon run-
ners placed third, fourth and fifth
in the two mile run. UCers also
placed in the 440 and 880 yard
contests.

of repetition is evidenced by a
student’s comment on hearing of
the Maroons’ fourth victory:
“What! They finally won —
again!” The dwindling crowds at
Wednesday's game seem to illus-
trate that the monotony of victory
arouses less enthusiasm than the
anger of too long and too bitter
defeat.

Pier wrestlers

floorMaroons;
Tech defeated

Navy Pier’s wrestlers threw
and pinned the whole UC team
Tuesday as they scored a 30-0
whitewash. Five of the Illini wins
were pins and three were deci-
sions.

The Maroons fared better in
previous competition. Last Friday
Coach Allan Bates’ matmen
trounced Illinois Tech by a score
of 21-13. Morley Hoffman clinched
the match for Chicago when he
was awarded the decision in his
match. Earlier Kent Flannery,
Bates and Don Donderi had won
their ruckuses on the Tech mats.
Chicago now has a 1-1 record.

Armed with a new battery of
half-nelsons and hammerlocks the
Maroons will attempt to restore
the team to the win column in the
contests at Wright Junior College
today.
