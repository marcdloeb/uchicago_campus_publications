No administration money this year,
housing coop plans go ahead anyway

by Arnie Matanky

>1/

Student Government is going ahead with its plans for a student housing cooperative even though there
won't be any money coming from the administration for the project for at least a year.

Clive Gray, SG president, told the student assembly Tuesday night that the student interest committee of
the University Board of Trustees had voted 8-1 in support of the coop project, but that the University's busi-
ness manager opposed a

University loan to set up
the coop.

Gray suggested that SG may
be able to rent a suitable building
for the next year and then buy it
with administration backing, aft-
er the students demonstrate their
ability to handle the project.

Council not discouraged

Other universities’ student hous-
ing coops started by renting their
buildings, Gray said, and then
proved they were capable of man-
aging their projects. “The SG ex-
ecutive council is not discour-
aged,” he added.

Kimpton speaks;

Lawrence Kimpton, Chancellor
of the University, in a speech giv-
en Tuesday afternoon before the
University Senate said that educa-
tion has lost ground in the United
States since the war. The speech,
which was given in Mandel Hall,
was heard by all tenure members
of the UC faculty.

In spite of the tremendous de-
mands made on education, the in-
vestment in it has not been pro-
portionate to that made in other
areas. This is partly the fault of
other universities.

Kimpton said that since he be-
came Chancellor, that is as of
April 12, 1951, his task has been
"to consolidate and stabilize the
economy of our institution.”

The university has, according to
Kimpton, kept in mind the fact
that the reputation of the Univer-
sity would not be assured solely
by economy and retrenchment.

Opinions

Last week the University released its official

containing descriptions anc

| Anticipating strong campus

explanations of both the new college AB degree and the joint degrees offered by the college and divisions. , ~ ~ _
reaction to these changes, the Maroon, this week, undertook to ascertain the nature of faculty and student opinion on the issue of
the revised programs.

Among those students
questioned, the Maroon
discovered an almost unani-
mous dissatisfaction with the
greater part of the revised pro-
gram, and with what was feared
to be the trend away from general
education to more and more spe-
cialized study. Only the new col-
lege AB, as distinguished from the
joint degrees, received consistent-
ly favorable student comment.

In order to achieve as wide a
representation of student opinion
as possible, the Maroon inter-
viewed both college and divisional
students. The following are repre-
sentative student reactions.

"Force of general education"

Norman Mages (Bi Sci): “Some
of the Bachelor’s programs make
a farce of general education by
enabling and advising students, to
take only three or four general
education courses outside of their
major field. It becomes, in effect,
an elective system with no com-
mon base in general education.”

Eileen Kirman (College): "I

went quite thoroughly through
the Announcements, and I was
generally disappointed. I was
especially sorry about the changes
leading toward the BS degree. I
think there is too little emphasis
placed on general education
courses; there is too much spe-
cialization too early.”

"Announcements lack one thing . . . M

Milt Kotler (College): “The new
announcements lack but one
thing, pictures of succulent coeds;
or, stated differently,, there is
much form without content.”

Fred Solomon (Bi Sci): “The
replaced booklet, If You Want an
Education, stated, Tf you are a
normally mature young man or
woman of sixteen, fifteen, or even
fourteen, it has been proven be-
yond doubt that you are able to
"take” going to college.’ Our new
Announcements of Undergraduate
Programs says, ‘Students ‘Stu-
dents with two or three years of
high-school credit who demon-
strate unusual academic achieve-
ment and social maturity may ap-
ply for admission to the College.

Their applications will begiven university. But in spite of the

BS programs a compromise

any change would be a bad one. I
think, though, that the tutorial

"The new BS programs are a com-
promise with expediency. They
represent the simple fact that
most individuals are not willing
to spend time and money in order
to get more of a liberal education
than is absolutely necessary."

Marcus Raskin (College): “Per-
haps in twenty years another
great awakening in education will
occur here so that the general
education program will not be an
almost insignificant part of spe-
cialized . education, but rather a
unified program similar to the
new general studies BA.”

Jim Rosenblum (Bi Sci): "The
new BA programs, I feel, reduce
the value of the UC College as
the best place for a general educa-
tion. The College is no longer an
individual standing prominently
out among many, but is reverting
to the prevalent type of American

Som*

mise, but since there was a neces-

sity for compromise, they did a
very slick job in carrying it off.”
"AB sounds good ..."

Dave Salzman (Hum): "The

part of the complex of increased
“athleticism” (as opposed to ath-
letics), as well as a general “rip-

the change with considerable
alarm.”

Walkouts, 3rd party threat UC team vs. visiting Indian debaters:

hit campus political parties

by Arnie Matonky

Rumblings of discontent were heard from both political
parties on the campus this week with the possibility of a third
party not ruled out.

Michael B. Girsdansky (Soc Sci) announced at the Student
Government meeting Tuesday night that he no longer con-

siders himself a member of the
Student Representative Party
(SRP).

Ralph D. Fertig (Soc Sci) dram-
atized his departure from SRP b’y
sitting on a chair in the middle
aisle before the meeting began.
Fertig, chairman of the SG neigh-
borhood commission, left SRP
amid party charges that he had
displayed “irresponsibility” in op-
erating a sound truck around the
campus.

Michael C. Kaufman (Col) is
the third member of SRP to leave
his party in the last few days.

Sol Hirsch (Law) quit the In-
dependent Students League (ISL)
after charging that “not enough
work is being done.” Clive Gray,
president of SG and ISL leader,
said that Hirsch had continually
refused to take part in party work
and had declined to participate in
a committee.

David Nash (Col) also walked
ou i of ISL, and Jus tin M. Johnson
(Col) was reportedly considering
running under the SRP banner in
the National Student Association

'Indian neutrality necessary for peace?

by David Schlessinger

“Resolved: Indian Neutrality is Necessary for an Understanding between East and West*
was the topic of a debate and discussion by the teams of Ward Wright and Lloyd Keno, UC
students, on the negative side, and Mrigendra Kumar Chaturvedi and Rameshchandra P.
Sirkar, traveling Indian students, arguing the affirmative position. The debate was spon-
sored by Student Forum in Soc Sci 122, Thursday, April 1.

The positions of the two sides were presented in four individual 10-minute speeches alter-

nating members of the oppos-
ing teams; these were followed
by four five-minute rebuttal
speeches and a questioning period.
India follows impartial course

During the course of the debate,
India’s position was formulated
as follows by the affirmative side:
India sees the current contest be-
tween world blocs as a struggle
for power. She feels that her most
useful role in this struggle is as
impartial mediator and concilia-
tor, trying to help reduce the ten-
sions which, as Chaturvedi said,
“lead to the atmosphere of hys-
teria and fear requisite for any
war.” .,

“The fact that India does serve
a useful purpose in world politics
supports the argument that she
can reduce the chances of war,
according to the affirmative
speakers. She is there as a uni-
versally-acceptable neutral when
the two great powers require a
mediator. In Korea, for example,

she helped to reduce the chances
of war by doing all she could to
keep conflicts localized and by
mediating on the Neutral Nations’
Commission. “If we have not ne-
gotiated a settlement between the
two major power blocs of the
world, we have at least helped to
create a climate of peace and to
bring about the beginnings of mu-
tual understanding,” summarized
Chaturvedi.

Hiltner talks on psychoanalysis

'Freud obsessed with religion'

by Diana Epstein

Developing the relationship religion may have to psychoanalysis was the objective of
Seward Hiltner, Acting Dean of the Federated Theological Schools, in his lecture — the sec-
ond in the series, “Psychoanalysis and the Modern World” — delivered before a capacity
crowd last Tuesday in Breasted Hall at 8 p.m.

In his hour-long talk Hiltner centered his psychoanalytic references on the thoughts and
works of Freud, expressing the rather universal judgment that all psychology has its begin-

nings in Freud; he, therefore,
is the most important con-
tributor to psychoanalytic de-
velopment.

“Psychoanalysis and religion
are not strictly coordinate terms”
Hiltner explained. Psychoanalysis
can be treated in three ways: as
a history (a movement from
Freud); as a theory (a set of prin-
ciples, however changing, with a
core); and as a therapeutic proc-
ess (a treatment which tries to
help somebody).

Freud evaluates religion negatively

Although Hiltner did not try to
define religion, he stated that it,
too, is always particular: it has
a history, a basic theory, and a
practice (which could be termed
“therapeutic”). In this sense, psy-
choanalysis and religion are cog-
nate and coordinate. Yet, the his-
tories of patients who have under-
gone psychoanalytic treatment
are not authoritative interpreta-
'tions of psychoanalysis, whereas
the histories of “patients” who
have been administered through
religion are authoritative inter-
pretations of religion. “The differ-
ence lies,” Hitlner added, “within
the nature of religion as a fellow-
ship.”

Freud’s first paper on religion
was published in 1907; in it, he re-
fers to religion as a “universal
obsessional neurosis.” Hiltner ob-
served, “Freud evaluated religion

negatively.” Key statements on
the functions of religion appear
in Freud’s "New Introductory
Lectures.”

Lists goals of religion

In these, Freud lists three basic
attempts of religion: to give man
information about the source and
origin of the universe; to assure
man of protection and final hap-
piness amid the changing vicissi-
tudes of life; and to try to guide
the thoughts and actions of man
by means of precepts which are
backed by the whole force of its
authority. Freud’s greatest critic-
ism was that religion attempted
to give man an illusion of knowl-
edge which did not exist.

Hiltner expressed fascination by
the fact that Freud returned again
and again to religion as a topic
for his writings. Only minor atten-

tion was given other phases of cul-
ture — art,'education, and myth.
“Concern for the function of re-
ligion was almost an obsession
with Freud,” Hiltner noted, smil-
ing. Religious origins, Freud felt,
were social origins. He saw relig-
ion as the “sole possible competi-
tor to science.”

Constructs five-point theology

Some years ago at UC, Hiltner,
who is associate professor of pas-
toral theology, headed a seminar
on Freud and religion. The latter
half of his lecture concerned his
observations and interpretations
of the two, formulated, in part,
through this seminar. Hiltner pre-
s e n t e d a five-point Freudian
theology:

1. Actual life can be understood
only in terms of its dynamic or

see "Hiltner," page 10

A referendum relating to the
method of filling vacancies in
Student Government will be voted
on by the campus on April 22 and
23, at the same time as the Na-
tional Student Association elec-
tions. This proopsed amendment
to the SG constitution states:

“Resolved that vacancies aris-
ing in Student Government shall
be filled where possible:

“A) in the case of a recognized
campus political party, by another
member of that party.

“B) in the case of an independ-
ent, by an applicant of similar
political views.”

The referendum was added to
the ballot after receiving more
than 200 signatures necessary for
such a move. Last year the same
referendum was voted on, falling
short of the necessary two-thirds
by a few votes.

At present, vacancies are filled
by a decision of the executive
council of Student Government.

Sirkar made the further point
for the Indian position that India
sees a division between ideology
and violence. “India does not see
possible compromise between ide-
ologies,” he said, “but ideologies
do not cause wars anyway; on
the contrary, common self-interest
should prevent wars.” It is arma-
ment races which cause wars by
arousing fear and distrust; a show
of force only produces the psycho-
logical atmosphere of jealous sus-
picion which leads to war hys-
teria. Another war would be disas-
trous, but can be avoided by com-
promise of the hostile nations
through the mediation of neutrals
such as India in the world forum
of the United Nations.

Wright and Keno formulated
the opposite side of the argument
by examining Indian foreign pol-
icy to see if it is realistic, and
also to see whether it helps or hin-

ders the efforts of nations

Hitchcock con-man

given year in prison

Charles Harris, of 6345 S. University, who was arrested
while soliciting magazine subscriptions at Hitchcock Hall
last month, has been sentenced to a year in the House of
Correction for operating a confidence game.

Municipal Judge Henry C.
of the con game charge in Grai
ing is pending on Harris’ peti-
tion to be freed on the con
game and one other charge.

According to campus police,
Harris solicited magazine sub-
scriptions in Snell, Hitchock, In-
ternational House, Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity house. Burton Judson

and the Chicago Theological
Seminary dormitory.

John T. Compton, president of
the Associated Trade Press

(ATP), said that Harris is a bona-
fide independent agent of ATP
and that UC students who bought
subscriptions from him are pro-
tected by bond if they still have
their receipts.

The house head of Hitchcock
Hall, Channing Lushbough, had
disclosed earlier that students
who subscribed to Newsweek
through Harris last quarter have
never received the magazine.
Lushbough cited wide variations
in subscription prices offered by
Harris as another indication that
the offers might be fraudulent.

University rules bar agents of
any organization not recognized
as a campus group from solicit-
ing on campus. Officials have
asked that any students who are
approached on campus by a rep-
resentative of non - recognized
group turn over any literature
they receive to the campus police.

James Compton, vice-president
of ATP and son of its president,
said this week that every sub-
scription from UC students hold-
ing ATP receipts is being proc-
essed and that all of the subscrip-
tions are being forwarded to the
magazines involved.

At the court hearings on March
16, officials of the Veterans Ad-
ministration (VA) tried to have
Harris put under VA supervision.
The younger Compton said this
week that Harris has been a men-
tal patient at the VA’s hospital
at Downey and had never been
released.

Judge Ferguson and the state's
attorney’s office indicated they
were opposed to putting Harris
under VA supervision instead of
having him serve out his year in
the Bridewell.

as far as he knows, no residents

ton explained that it takes “from

to begin arriving.

7 given scholarships

to UC, foreign study

The University scholarship committee announced the grant-
ing of four fellowships for study at foreign universities and
three William Rainy Harper fellowships for study at UC.

James V. Compton, who holds an MA in history and is
presently studying in the education department, was awarded
the Konrad Adenauer fellowship for study in any West Ger-

man university.

The Adenauer fellowship
which covers all travel ex-
penses to Germany, tuition and
a living stipend, was instituted by
the West German Chancellor Kon-
rad Adenauer, on his visit to UC
in April last year.

An exchange agreement with
the University of Paris enables
two UC students, Daniel Gerould
and Muhsin Mahdi, to carry on
their studies at the University of
Paris. Gerould will study the his-

point in a student’s career at
which the Bachelor’s degree shall
be granted than what that degree
—whether the AB or the BS—rep-
resents in the way of a liberal
education; for I believe that this
degree should signify its possessor
has a sound liberal education. The
college is not necessarily the sole
custodian of a liberal education,
and it is quite possible and proper
for the departments to continue
the work begun in the college.
Candidly, however, I think that
some of the degree programs do
overstress professional training
at the expense of some elements
desirable in a liberal education.
Happily this is not true of most
of the programs. The outline of
the program-leading to the college
Bachelor of Arts degree (as dis-
tinct from the joint degrees) con-
tains a challenge to the faculties
of both the college and the divi-
sions. I believe that it offers the
way to the development of the
best liberal arts program that has
yet been developed in this coun-
try.”

“Consider Hie new curriculum"

Charles Wegener (associate pro-
fessor of humanities in the col-
lege): “The thing that seems to
me most important to say about
the way the new programs look
from where I sit is that I consider
the new college curriculum, with
the addition of a year of tutorial
studies, the greatest educational
opportunity since Mark Hopkins
felled his tree. I think we have

long needed such a thing in the
college curriculum and see noth-
ing in it inconsistent with the prin-
ciples which we take so seriously.
So far as the joint programs are
concerned I think the problem
now is not to be solved by debate
but by action. I think most of
them can be made to work and do
the jobs which they were designed
to do. The University decided last
year that it wanted to do a differ-
ent sort of job in undergraduate
education. To accept the decision
is to accept the task of doing the
job.”

Programs offer opportunity

Donald Meiklejohn (associate
professor of philosophy in the col-
lege): “The new programs offer
a genuine opportunity for the Col-
lege and the Departments to work
together, and to that extent they
surely are welcome. I suppose a

LAK visits dorms,
tells girls his views

Receptions and dinners in each of the three Group-C wom-
en’s dorms were held Monday in honor of guest members of
the administration and teaching staff of UC. The meetings
between the girls of the residence halls and the administrative
officers and faculty members were sponsored by the Inter-
dorm Council and House Councils of Foster, Green, and Kelly
Houses. These annual dinners
offer the opportunity for
women residents to become

acquainted' with both the guests
and the administrative and educa-
tional policies of the University.

Guests at Green Hall were Chan-
cellor and Mrs. Kimpton, Miss
Margaret E. Perry, assistant dean
in the college, Mark Ashin, assist-
ant professor of English, and
Meyer W. Isenberg, assistant pro-
fessor of Humanities.

Topics ranging from curricu-
lum to the housing problems in
the University area were dis-
cussed and commented upon by
both faculty and students. When
asked if the major reason for the
new AB changes in the College
was to increase the enrollment,
Chancellor Kimpton replied, “Def-
initely no. Tuition fees supply
only 4 million of the 20 million
dollar budget. The major portion
of a school’s budget is always sup-
plied by endowments, and the Uni-
versity of Chicago is one of the
most heavily endowed institutions
in the country.”

Kelly House was host to Robert
E. Streeter, associate dean of the
College, Mrs. Streeter, and Mrs.

of anthropology in the College.

CJA drive to begin;

many enjoy benefits

The Combined Jewish Appeal
(CJA) Drive on campus opens
April 12. Funds will be solicited
by CJA student workers through-
out the week.

The Jewish Welfare Fund and
the Jewish Federation of Chicago
are the two partners in the Com-
bined Jewish Appeal, together
these two organizations and their
affiliates, not only in the State of
Israel and in the city of Chicago,
but also in Europe. North Africa,
the Middle East, and other parts
of the United States. Combined
Jewish Appeal funds are used for
relief, rehabilitation, education,
medical, and social welfare needs,
and community betterment.

The principal beneficiary of the
Combined Jewish Appeal is the
Jewish Welfare fund, which re-
ceives 70 per cent of the money
raised in the drive. Included in
the organizations which benefit
through Jewish Welfare Fund is
the United Jewish Appeal.

Thirty per cent of the funds
raised in the CJA drive goes to
the Jewish Federation of Chicago.

good many of the college students
doubt that the enterprise can be
truly mutual and fear that the col-
lege as they have known it is done
for. They should perhaps remem-
ber Plato’s argument (Republic
Bo,ok LX) that the wise judge is
the man who has experienced in
both areas under consideration;
moreover, it is of course true that
no present students need elect any
of the new plans. While I am
deeply persuaded of the merits of
the College curriculum, and be-
cause I think it is good, I think its
tional inquiry t h a t lies ahead.
There is some danger that the
new boundary lines on the pro-
gram charts will take on the
status or the Korean 38th parallel,
but my belief and hope is that
both college and departments will
find they have a good deal to gain
by friendly interpenetration. Cer-

Dean of Students Robert Strozier,
Carl Grip, director of the Univer-
sity housing system, and Mrs.
Grip were guests at Foster Hall.

Chancellor Kimpton and Dean
Strozier led an informal discus-
sion on the new AB changes in
Kelly Lounge following the din-
ners. Dean Strozier outlined the
underlying motives and subse-
quent accomplishments of the
field trips to high schools all over
the country conducted by Chan-
cellor Kimpton and him last sum-
mer. He expressed a strong feel-
ing that the close rapport be-
tween the high schools and the
College, almost non-existent in the
past few years, is being strength-
ened again. Chancellor Kimpton
stated that one of the important
goals of the UC College plan is to
strengthen American education on
the secondary school level. He
also assured the group that the
new AB would permit transfers to
graduate schools more easily than
at present.

In answering a question from
the floor, Chancellor Kimpton
stated that exceptional high school
students will still be encouraged
to apply for admission before
graduation from high school.

If each organization now affili-

down on expense and the times a

ed for funds. Funds are only cob

Sign Bill of Rights

' Several years ago, at a county fair in Wisconsin, petitioners circu-
lating the Declaration of Independence found to their amazement
that people were afraid to sign this document. Today, in this same
Blate of Wisconsin, people who are no longer afraid to exercise their
democratic rights have collected, in a few short weeks, 200,000 signa-
tures on a petition to recall Senator Joseph R. McCarthy as one of
the leading instigators of the hysteria that makes people fear the
jeaffirmation of America’s most cherished documents.

It is in this spirit of reaffirmation of these principles in the face
of the opposition of men like McCarthy that the Academic Freedom
Week committee has launched a petition campaign, presenting the
Bill of Rights for signature by students. The campaign was begun
last Monday with the signatures of Dean Strozier and other admin-
istration and faculty members.

A signature to the Bill of Rights today means even more than the
Vote of Congress that passed it over 150 years ago. For today, even
more than in the days when Thomas Jefferson and his followers
proposed the Ten Amendments, people in positions of influence wish
to see these rights suppressed and forgotten. But it is hard to forget
a document that thousands or millions have read and signed. This
petition will show that we Americans are still conscious of our heri-
tage of democratic rights.

Welcome Book Exchange

In terms of the ends it was meant to serve, the original Student
Government Book Exchange was a magnificent conception. Here, for
the first time, was an agency whereby books bought because a
course required them could be passed on to future scholars and
where economy conscious UC students (and which of us isn’t) could
purchase valued additions to their libraries at minimal cost.

The grand conception, however, never quite came off. Located in
one of the obscurer recesses of Cobb Hall, the Exchange soon found
itself suffering from an excessive lack of customers. Many students
didn’t know it existed, more didn’t know where it was. Even when
book-hunting students conquered the nemesis of ignorance and found
themselves confronted by the door of the exchange they usually
found themselves locked out. They were, they found, victims of the
infrequent and irregular hours when the Exchange operated. One
year, in fact, the Exchange failed to open for the first three weeks
of the quarter, the time, it need hardly be stated, when the service
was most heavily needed.

This quarter, however, things have changed. Student Government
has moved the Exchange to Reynolds Club and given it a rational
set of business hours. In terms of convenience to the entire campus,
it is doubtful that a more convenient location could be found. The
large number of students who frequent the Reynolds Club may
now’, in passing, drop in on the Exchange to browse and perhaps
buy before going on about their business. No one, it is certain, would
have thought of “dropping in” on a cubby hole among the steam
pipes of Cobb basement. The change means greater use of the book
exchange, a better selection of books and a few savings for hard-
pressed students. It is, finally, the type of solid, practical student
service that Student Government can do so well and which the cam-
pus needs so badly.

Student Government is due congratulations and many thinks for
the resuscitation of its once magnificent conception.

Letters ...

Wonts self-expression

The behavior this year and last of 1SL
in Student Government and the All-
Campus Civil Liberties Committee, as
seen from the MAROON and from visits
to these bodies, reminds me of nothing

so much as the following fable:

A certain well known traveling enter-
tainer owned a remarkable parrot which
could do long division and extract
square roots, and what is more, could
design bridges and discourse at length
on politics and literature. When the
entertainer first discovered the remark-
able gifts of this bird he was very happy
and said to himself, “Now I shall be
able to travel about and amaze specta-

tors throughout the land, and I shall
be famous.”

But he amazed no one. It chanced
that his first audience was composed
entirely of ignorant farmers who could
not appreciate the erudition and sub-
tlety of the bird. When they told their
friends merely that they had seen a
talking parrot, their friends said, '‘That
is nothing new. Why should one pay
merely to see a talking parrot?” So the
entertainer grew increasingly poor, and
he sought to find a way to recapture
his audiences.

At last he thought of a plan. He ac-
quired an ordinary mongrel dog, and
at his next performance placed the
mongrel on the stage along with the
parrot. When the parrot spoke people
thought they were listening to the mon-
grel, and they told their friends about
this wonderful performance, and the
entertainer prospered and was exceed-
ingly glad.

As the entertainer’s fame grew, so did
that of the dog. People came from far
and wide to listen to him, and not a day
went by that he did not receive tele-
grams and flowers and scholarships and
samples of every kind of dog food. For
the first time in his life the dog was
well taken care of, and in appearance
he soon gave no hint of his lowly
origin. Meanwhile, the parrot, who was
ignored by all, received each day only
a few grains of birdseed, just as in the
days when the entertainer was poor.
Naturally he grew leaner and more un-
healthy as the days went by.

One day the parrot died of parrot
fever. Now that it was too late, the en-
tertainer felt very sorry for the bird,
and for what he had done. But tender-
ness soon gave way to realism. His
livelihood gone, he could no longer af-
ford to feed any extra mouths. So he
took the dog away from its special food
and belongings, and put it out in the
gutter with all the other mongrels and
locked the door. ‘‘Good luck,*’ he
thought. ‘‘How wil you, ever get along
in the gutter after all this fine care?”

But the dog felt otherwise. “Thank
God!” he thought. “Hell, I’m no Leon-
ardo Da Vinci, and this lightning cal-
culating stuff is just sublimation!”

With an ever-present faith in the
value of self-expression.

Leaves SRP

At the SRP caucus of Sunday, April 4,
a member of SRP was accused of having
violated the Student Code while acting
in the name of SRP. It was feared that
this action may have endangered SRP's
legal status on this campus. Led by a
certain faction of SRP, the caucus de-
cided to investigate the action of its
member. A 15-minute times limit was
set, and no copies of the Student Code
were consulted during this investiga-
tion.

No one except the defendant presented
(or had) any facts concerning the case.
Members of the aforementioned faction
engaged in dilatory Invective; the im-
mediate expulsion of the defendant was
moved, in the middle of proceedings,
and seconded; this was ruled out of
order by a fair-minded chairman.

An irrational atmosphere arose, as the
defendant was accused of being a detri-
ment to the party by a member of one
day’s standing. Feeling that his case
was being denied fair consideration, and
that he was being attacked on extrane-
ous political grounds, the defendant
resigned from SRP; he was followed by
three other members who also felt he
was denied fair treatment.

During the next two days the action
of the resigned member was discussed
with Eli Stein, chairman of the Com-
mittee on Recognized Student Organ-
izations. It was determined that in no
way could SRP be held responsible for
his action; and that, were SRP actu-
ally responsible, the resignation of a
member would in no way lessen SRP’s
responsibility.

These facts were reported to the SRP
caucus held Wednesday, April 7. Know-
ing that the people who had resigned,
with the members who sympathized
with them, wished to return to the
caucus if they wer^ welcome, and feel-
ing that an injustice had been done
during the previous caucus, I moved the
following resolution:

“In view of the fact that the at-
mosphere of the previous caucus was
not conducive to sound judgment;

And in view of the fact that per-
usal of the Student Code makes it
obvious that there was no clear cut
threat to the organizational exist-
ence of the SRP in the action of
Mr. ------;

The caucus regrets any unfairness
that may have resulted from the at-
mosphere and conduct of that meet-
ing.”

Again tempers rose; again personal
attacks were made on the first resigned
member. Many said in effect, that since
SRP was becoming ‘‘respectable” It
should be purged of members unpopular
with the campus as a whole, no matter
what their competence or past service
to SRP.

Eventually the new middle-of-the-
road members of SRP, led by an au-
thoritarian faction of the old member-
ship, defeated the resolution 26 to 20.
Feeling that the SRP that I had joined
last Fall no longer existed, seeing no
further hope of reuniting the two fac-
tions into an SRP I could work and
agree with, and regarding the faction
called “SRP” as an Illiberal one, I an-
nounced my resignation from the party.

I am not a member of either faction
discussed above; I have acted independ-
ently for what I considered to be the
best interests of what SRP had been. I
urge the students on this campus not to
support the present unprincipled party.

Hum stifles college

The college developed a concept of a
liberal education embodying a certain
basic amount of knowledge and analy-
tical skills in a certain number of fields
of great import to the life of man in
our modern society. It is an integrated
whole which will be destroyed by cut-
ting out any vital component.

I think that the idea of integrating
general and specialized education is a
good one, and that doing it in the tradi-
tional four years would be nice. In
theory, there was to be enough dead
wood between the college and the divi-
sions so that an essentially complete
program could be put together in four
years.

As the programs have come out, the
professional schools and the Social Sci-
ence division have shown their apprecia-
tion of the college program by leaving
it intact.

The Biological Science division has re-
tained 10 comps. This means that a
student placing out of two comps will
miss two courses including OMP or
History. These integration courses, with
some justification have been called the
meat of the college; they are very im-
portant in establishing the relationship
between the college courses and leav-
ing the student with a conception of
how to use his education. The difficulty
could be cleared up easily enough by
employing the Nat. Sci. Ill variant of
OMP and some other “comp saving”
device.

The Physical Science division, either
from the Inherent difficulties of the
field or personal prejudices, seem to
have left the divisional courses un-
altered while reducing the 14 comps to
a ridiculously low level of six comps.
However, by the ingenious use of all
the “comp saving” devices, they came
out mising only two comps for a com-
plete program. Hum III and Soc. Ill
would be the most probable omislons.
Both are important, the former by giv-
ing experience in criticism is an impor-
tant part of the literary education as
well as the means of providing needed
writing experience for those placing out
of English. Soc. Ill is obviously an im-
portant course for a responsible citizen,
teaching economics and political phil-
osophy.

It would seem that the two comps
could be worked in or taken care of on
the deficiency basis. If the specialized
studies really need so much time then
this division should not guarantee the
sacred four year BS.

The maze of programs in the Humani-
ties division presents, with few excep-
tions, by far the worst blow to a liberal
education. They cut down the number
of comps to seven or eight and did not
use any “time saving” devices. As a re-
sult some provide for only one course
in Soc., one in Nat. Sci., and only one
terminal course. In the light of the
present world situation, the great im-
portance of science and the need for
social understanding, the flagrant omis-
sion of these sequences is utterly absurd.

Unfortunately, when they cut courses,
they do not merely cut down the inten-
sity of work on a given problem: they
hack out the problem all together,
leaving the concept of a liberal educa-
tion a bloody farce. Integration is im-
possible. Any such reduction is decidedly
out of spirit with the announced pur-
pose of the present change; and the
university must suffer losses in pres-
tige if It permits its liberal education
standards to be generally lowered or the
present college program to be shredded.

The complete college programs in the
professions and Social Sciences division
are encouraging and the others can be
improved by the appropriate “comp
saving” devices. If the divisions feel
they cannot be bothered to make the
needed adjustments, it is their responsi-
bility of the university to see that our
high concept of a liberal education is
essentially maintained. John Bucher

Obstructs discussion

Lest it be hastily assumed that during
Academic Freedom Week we of the Uni-
versity of Chicago can only point the
accusing finger at other schools, we feel
it necessary to report on a recent and
sad experience closer home.

We proposed some time ago to hold a
forum on student civil liberties with
speakers putting forward the views of
various student political organizations,
sponsored by as many of the campus
political clubs as we could. After con-
sultation it was agreed that speakers
would be invited to present the views
of the SDA, the Young Democrats, the
Young Republicans, the Young Socialist
League, and the Labor Youth League
(and any other national student groups
we could find). But suddenly it ap-
peared that Mr. Birenbaum objected to
the inclusion of a speaker from the
Labor Youth League (the LYL), claim-
ing that (1) he saw no reason for hear-
ing them at all, (2) they were not a
registered student organization, and (3)
it would appear that the three sponsor-
ing clubs were somehow endorsing the
LYL. To overcome the third objection
the posters for the meeting were revised
to make it absolutely clear that an
individual speaker —not the organiza-
tion — was being sponsored as part of
a symposium of different viewpoints
But Mr. Birenbaum persisted in his
three arguments. Knowing that he could
hardly deny the right of student groups
to hear speakers of their own choosing,
he now demanded written certificates
of sponsorship from the various spon-
soring organizations, stating that the
group approved sponsoring the speaker
for the LYL on campus, to be signed
not merely by the chairman but by the
executive council or its equivalent.

Mr. Birenbaum cannot but realize
that aside from the natural timidity
which this novel move created among
members of all three organizations, it
also necessitated hours of extra work
and revising of plans to carry out this
procedure. It is precisely this type of
“subtle” blocking of free discussion
which is the greatest obstacle we be-
lieve towards genuine civil liberties.

If Mr. Birenbaum intends to protect
us from something or other by institut-
ing procedures of this sort, let him
come out and say so and put his pro-
posal into the code of student regula-
tions, which at present provide no
special rules for sponsoring speakers
from organizations which are not them-
selves recognized student clubs. Friends
of academic freedom then will know
just where they stand. But this present
procedure only stirs up repeated (and
justified) resentments, gives aid and
comfort to the very restrictors of stu-
dent life he claims to oppose, and
demonstrates a lamentable ignorance of
the harsh lessons taught by recent years
of political hysteria — that civil liber-
ties cannot be defended unless they are
impartially defended for all.

WUCB expands schedule again To hold, forum

for AF Week

WUCB, the student radio station of the University, has started the quarter with an im-
proved and expanded program schedule. Two of the new programs, produced by the Na-
tional Association of Educational Broadcasters, are “The Jeffersonian Heritage,” a series of
13 dramatizations of the life and thought of the author of the Declaration of Independence,
and “The Ways of Mankind,” an introduction to anthropology. Both “The Jeffersonian
Heritage,” which stars Claude Raines, and “The Ways of Mankind” were produced under a
Ford Foundation grant, and -------------------------------------------------------------------

George Probst, Director of the
University Radio Office, and
Robert Redfield, Professor of An-
thropology, were active in their

production.

Highlighting WUCB’s schedule
of popular music is “Wheel of
Fortune,” a documentary history
of the work of female .vocalist
Kay Starr. The program, produced
in cooperation with Miss Starr
and Capitol Records, exclusively
for WUCB, will be a general in-
troduction to a more detailed pro-
gram next year. The show, start-
ing Monday at 8:30, will feature
extremely rare early recordings.
New news commentary to start

A precedent for WUCB will be
broken by the news commentary
program “Perspective,” to be
heard on Fridays at 7:45. In keep-
ing with its policy of not attempt-
ing to duplicate services of other
AM stations, WUCB has avoided
world news in the past. However,
“Perspective” offers a general
analysis of the news of an entire
week, a thing not often found on
commercial radio. The program
does not attempt to cover late-
breaking scoops, but as its title

ITS ALL A MATTER OF TASTE

implies, news from the vantage

Though not definitely scheduled
at this time, WUCB will soon have
a program of jazz which will fea-
ture rare collector’s items. The
specific time will be announced
sometime next week.

Bedtime stories begun

Each Wednesday on WUCB, the
last live program of the evening
will be “Bedtime Story,” readings
of short stories selected for their
late-at-night appropriateness. This
week the featured story will be
“Man From the South,” a selec-
tion from “Someone Like You,”
an anthology of stories by Raoul
Dahl.

Other highlights this week are
the second in a series of “Ameri-

Pete Seeger at 9 Tuesday, record-

When you come right down to it, you
smoke for one simple reason . . . enjoy-
ment And smoking enjoyment is all a
matter of taste. Yes, taste is what counts
in a cigarette. And Luckies taste better.

Two facts explain why Luckies taste
better. First, L.S./M.F.T.—Lucky Strike
means fine tobacco ... light, mild, good-
tasting tobacco. Second, Luckies are ac-
tually made better to taste better . . .
always round, firm, fully packed to draw
freely and smoke evenly.

So, for the enjoyment you get from
better taste, and only from better taste,
Be Happy—Go Lucky. Get a pack or a

upon the position that their organ-
ization has on the preservation of
freedom on the campuses.

The meeting is being sponsored
by Students for Democratic Ac-
tion and the Politics Club. It will
take place in Rosenwald 2, at 4
p.m. Tuesday, April 12.

The final deadline for petitions
for candidates in the forthcoming
National Student Association
(NSA) Election is noon Tuesday.

Petitions may be secured from
the Student Government office.
When the forty needed signatures
have been obtained, the petition
should be returned to the SG of-
fice. Any UC student with a full
course of studies on the quad-
rangles, at least a C average,
and more than one quarter resi-
dence, is eligible to be a candi-
date.

The campus-wide NSA election
will be on April 22 and 23.

Business confab

Campuses reassert freedoms

Students, faculty question
suspensions, loyalty oaths

Boston faculty group chides administration

At Boston Universify, last February, the chapter of the American
Association of University Professors challenged the University
administration for the suspension of Maurice Halperin, who had
refused to testify before the Jenner committee.

The statement said, “It appears to us that the principles of democ-
racy are threatened when civilian review boards bypass the organ-
ized system of law and act as judge and jury on charges which, if
true, should be used for indictment before the bar of justice.”

Boston University News

Connecticut supports Benton's statement

In March, thirty-eight members of the University of Connecticut
faculty signed a statement expressing faith in former Senator Ben-
ton’s charge against McCarthy.

In the statement, the professors declared that the truth of Ben-
ton’s charges was “naturally strengthened” when McCarthy “chose
to avoid the issue in the best manner of what he likes to call ‘fifth-
amendment Communists.’ ”

Connecticut Campus

Swarthmore panel censures totalitarianism

At Swarthmore a panel on “Religious Aspects of Academic Free-
dom” was held at the end of February. Speakers from Universities
and schools in the area appeared.

According to the Swarthmore Phoenix, the last speaker, Merril
Bush of Friends Central School, “made perhaps the most profound
effect upon the audience.” He raised the question of the kind of
society that makes freedom possible and rules out totalitarianisms.
Replying to a question on loyalty oaths he said, “Loyalty is a thing
of the spirit—it cannot be forced, can only be won.”

Wisconsin reaffirms tradition

At the University of Wisconsin, the faculty, the students, and administrative bodies have
reaffirmed a traditional university policy toward recognition of campus organizations and
approval of speakers. Last November the administrative “student life and interests com-
mittee” completed a report after almost 10 months of study.

The report came out of a controversy about the rights of certain left wing organizations,
particularly those on the attorney general’s “subversive activities list.” According to the re-
port, the only such organiza-
tion recognized on the campus
was the Wisconsin chapter of

the Labor Youth League.

Encourage organizations

The report stated that “The Uni-
versity of Wisconsin encourages
students to form organizations for
educational advancement of their
interests in all fields ...” "The
University could not, of course,
tolerate any organization which
in its purposes or actions violated
the laws of the United States or
of the state of Wisconsin . . . ”
“Understanding that these . . .
organizations” (the former) "per-
form a function of education com-
plementary to that of the class-
room and are a preparation for a
self-directed group activity after
college, the faculty encourages
participation in them.”

The report went on to point out

Copland in question;
cancel lecture series

Aaron Copland, one of America’s leading musicians, was
denied the right to lecture at the University of Colorado this
year. Although he had been invited to deliver a series of guest
lectures, he was later refused permission to speak on the
grounds that he was “controversial.”

It all began when Congressman Busbey (R., Ill.) objected
to Copland being played at
Eisenhower’s inauguration.

The story was picked up by

the St Louis Post-Dispatch. When
the story reached the Colorado
campus it went through a series
of channels until it reached the
president of the university who
cancelled the invitation to Cop-
land.

Upon hearing of the Univer-
sity’s action, the student body was
“outraged.” The Colorado Daily
took a poll of the faculty and
found that 64 per cent felt that
he should have been invited as a
musician, 6 per cent said no, and
29 per cent had no comment.

Government passes resolution

The student government passed
a resolution to the effect that: Be-
cause the complete facts were not
known and because lack of infor-
mation leads to doubts, etc., and
because outer attacks again seem
to be focusing on the University

“the possible consequences of
joining local groups affiliated
with national political organiza-
tions designated for certain pur-
poses of the government as sub-
versive.” It said that “Inclusion of
an organization in this list does
not affect its status as a lawfully
functioning organization nor does
it establish as a legal fact that it
is subversive.”

Organization recognized

“Since organizations listed as
subversive pursuant to law, are
now permitted lawfully to operate
in our state and nation, and since
the University cannot prevent its
students from being members of
such organizations, we believe
that the University should regis-
ter such organizations when they
operate on the campus.”

Among the reasons for this
policy the report stated that “Stu-

positibn as a democratic leader,
“resolved that all pertinent facts
be made available.”

In addition the American Asso-
ciation of University Professors
passed a resolution deploring the
cancellation of Copland’s lectures,
but defeated another resolution
reinviting Copland by a vote of
61-40. However, a resolution call-
ing for further inviting of guest
lecturers on capability passed. It
read in part:

Faculty committee to support
Academic freedom

“All faculty senate committees
which hereafter invited individ-
uals to appear on this campus be
requested to support the prin-
ciples of academic freedom by dis-
regarding legally unsubstantiated
political criticism directed at pros-
pective lecturers or performers
and consider only the individual’s
competence In his chosen field.”

Texas protests McCarthy's talk

The selection of Joseph McCarthy as the principal speaker at the San Jacinto Day Cele-
bration has been protested by a large number of students at the University of Texas. The
action was undertaken by a group of Texas students last Tuesday.

The spokesman for the group, Franklin Spears, president of the Students’ Association,
said that an audience of 2,000 was expected at a planned mass meeting to be held on Tues-
day, April 6. In the meantime, a petition was drawn up and plans for its circulation were

being discussed. The petition
began with a reference to H.
R. Cullen, a Houston million-
aire, who had in the name of the
San Jacinto chapter of the So*»
of the Republic of Texas, invited
McCarthy to speak. The petition
went on to say in part:

Invitation questioned

“Why is it fitting that out of
all the men of public trust in the
nation, Mr. Cullen should be per-
mitted to invite the one man who
has done more than any other to
undermine the basic American
principles of fair play and free
speech ?

“By what remote logic was Mc-
Carthy selected as a spokesman
for Texas independence? With in-
creasing and disturbing regularity
he has been coming to Texas to
confer with a few wealthy men
who do not represent the people
as a whole. Why, may we ask,
should Texas become the crucible
for the ambitions of the Senator
who has been charged with a
great multitude of wrongs in
Washington and who is at this
very moment under serious attack
in his own home state?

dents must be given the freedom
of discussion permitted citizens
of the United States and of the
State of Wisconsin, if they are to
be trained for responsible citizen-
ship.”

Boosts discussion

The report went on to say “Rec-
ognizing the contribution of extra-
curricular activities to the educa-
tional experience of students, the
Committee encourages discussion,
under student direction, of ideas
by persons actively associated
with those ideas.

“The Board of Regents said in
1894: ‘Whatever may be the limita-
tions which trammel inquiry else-
where, we believe that the great
State University of Wisconsin
shall ever encourage that contin-
ual and fearless sifting and win-
nowing by which alone the truth
can be found.’ The Regents said in
1922 that this statement shall be
‘applicable to teaching in the
classroom and to the use of Uni-
versity halls for public addresses.’
In 1949 and again in 1952, the
Regents stated that ‘an opportun-
ity critically to study the pro-
posals and claims of systems alien
to our own is the intellectual right
of every student.’ ”

Bill of Rights confirmed

Concluding, the report said,
“Students enjoy the privileges of
American citizens guaranteed by
the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights.”

In December, shortly after the
report was issued, the Wisconsin
Labor Youth League chapter was
granted the right to present a
address on the University campus
by an editor of the Daily Worker.
Senate backing

Later in December, the Student
Senate lent its backing to the ad-
ministrative report. Soon after-
ward, the University faculty voted
unanimously to support the stand.

The Madison Capital Times
called the position “an excellent
reaffirmation of the duty of a
university to promote free in-
quiry.” The Racine Journal Times
said it was “a clear test of the
freedom of choice and the free-
dom of speech.” Three other news-
papers in McCarthy’s state of Wis-
consin published similar editorial
comment.

Stands for democracy

“There comes a time in the his-
tory of every assault on democ-
racy when the people, the final
jurors of our public men, must
stand for democracy or risk the
only historical alternative, some
form of tyranny. . .. We will not
be silent longer. . . . Better to
leave the memories of San Jacinto
to the dignity of silence than to
have them blasphemed by an ir-
responsible demagogue.”

At the first open meeting of the
group, over 800 students turned
out to listen to speakers who were
for and against the petition. The
meeting was orderly, but tense.
Afterwards 418 of those assem-
bled signed the petition. Spears
emphasized that they were acting
as private citizens rather than in
any official capacity. Spears ex-
plained that the meting was called
as an open forum to discuss the
merits of both sides of the issue.

Do not question right to speak

“We are not here to question
the right of any man to speak
anywhere,” he asserted. “Our sole
purpose is to entertain discussion
about petitions the Sons of the
Republic to reconsider its choice
of speakers. Let the world know
that McCarthy speaks for himself,
not for Texans.”

One student, a loose-jointed

Michigan students state methods
to protect investigated students

Faced with a possible investigation at the University of
Michigan by the Un-American Activities Committee, the
Student Legislature at Michigan made a series of recom-
mendations to safeguard students who might be called to
testify.

The statement passed on Nov. 19, 1953, was made to over-

rule present University regu-
lations providing for possible
suspension or expulsion for
“conduct unbecoming a student”
or for damaging “the good name
of the University.”

The statement, reads in part:

“Student Legislature believes
that any student called to testify
before the House Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee or any other
Congressional investigating com-
mittee should not be subject to
charges by the University discip-
linary rules:

1)	“merely because he has been
called to testify.

2)	“because of his refusal to
testify.”

The policy also states that any
cases based on charges arising out
of the committee hearings should
be handled by a joint judiciary

Columbia faculty confers
on dismissals of teachers

At Columbia University, cases of faculty dismissal involv-
ing academic freedom will be subject to the consultation of
the whole faculty, according to a memorandum released by
the president’s office, in what is probably Columbia’s first
formal acceptance of this procedure. In January the presi-
dent’s office stated:

“There has been no instance
in the recent history of the
University of the dismissal of
any teacher where the issue of
academic freedom was involved.
In the event that such a considera-
tion ever arose, the colleagues of
such a teacher would surely be
consulted.”

Recently, the issue of academic
freedom had aroused a great deal
of controversy and organized ac-
tivity on the part of the faculties.
Thus far only three of the twelve
faculties in the university have
adopted statements on academic
freedom: those of the College,

Texan, spoke for several minutes
and then added: “AU I came here
for was to sign my name on that
little petition. I don’t want Mc-
Carthy to speak for me.” As the
crowd broke into loud clapping, a
petition was passed to the speak-
er, who signed on stage and then
sauntered out.

Discussion cut short

After the discussion was cut
short by the late hour, signing
continued with the aid of flash-
lights and cigarette lighters. By
the following Friday, 884 signa-
tures had been collected. Future
plans for the petition include the
setting up of booths at dapces
and other university functions.
The expected total is hoped to ex-
ceed 1,500.

At last reports, the petition sign-
ing campaign was gathering mo-
mentum. The Texans, rallying
about their cherished heritages,
have united in the opposition and
have called on their fellow Texans
everywhere by ending their peti-
tion by saying:

“Accordingly, we the under-
signed respectfully petition the
Sons of the Republic of Texas to
reconsider the choice of Sen. Mc-
Carthy as speaker on San Jacinto
Day as offensive to the good
judgment of Texans everywhere.”

council prior to any disciplinary
action by the University. This pro-
vision was included in event . a
student witness claims before the
committee that he is representing
opinion of the administration, fac-
ulty or student body or if charges
against students were brought for
any reason other than those listed
in the policy statement.

The third provision of the state-
ment emphasizes that member-
ship in the Communist Party per
se is not a violation of federal or
State law.

The policy, if followed, by the
University of Michigan would pro-
tect any student called to testify
or refusing to testify unless, as a
witness, he violated federal or
State law or attempted to repre-
sent the University committee or
any segment thereof.

Philosophy, and Political Science.
However, four other faculties are
planning to adopt similar state-
ments this spring.

Although Dr. Kirk, President of
Columbia University, had not pub-
licly condemned congressional in-
quiries into alleged subversive ac-
tivities in colleges, he affirmed
that the Administration does not
judge failures to testify before a
legislative investigation as auto-
matic ground for dismissal of a
teacher. Dr. Kirk and organized
faculty opinion agree that each
case involving the removal of a
teacher should be determined on
its own merits.

Schools throughout country
conduct Freedom Weeks

by Mitchell Stein

Academic freedom has become one of the major concerns of students on campuses through-
out the country. In almost all universities and colleges activities and events centered around
an academic freedom week have either taken place or are being planned for the immediate
future.

At the City College of New York (CCNY), Academic Freedom Week was held from April
5-12. Buttons were distributed that read “I’m not scared” ... A poll was taken on the sub-
ject, “Conformity on the cam-
pus” . . . Forums, dances,
debates and films rounded out

the week.

Also at CCNY . . . The Observa-
tion Post, the school paper, spon-
sored a series of debates. In

the first or second week in April
. . . Plans were drafted for the
founding of an intercollegiate pa-
per to deal with all views on Aca-

Kimpton hails UC role in investigations;
noted educators present views on freedom

Last June, the Senate sub-
committee on internal security
subpoenaed a group of Uni-
versity of Chicago personnel. In
his State of the University address
last October, Chancellor Kimpton
made the following statement
about the investigation and about
academic freedom at the Univer-
sity;

“Last spring certain members
of our faculty and staff were in-
vestigated by the Senate subcom-
mittee on internal security. This
challenge to the integrity and loy-
alty of our University was met
with foresight, with dignity, and
with honor. It was symbolic of
this occasion that Ernest W. Bur-
gess and Anton J. Carlson, full of
years, of wisdom, and of services
to enrich our way of life, were
called into a private session and,
when they asked for a public
hearing, were denied it. These men
have a special meaning for us.
Ernest W. Burgess and Anton
Carlson, with their learning, will-
ingness to dissent, and devotion to
freedom, symbolize the best tradi-
tion of our University. May we
always continue it. To preserve
it is to make our contribution to
the best that is in the American
tradition.”

Universities abuse

the joint” for various radical, re-
ligious, and other differences, he
said that this “free play of vari-
ety” is the basis of our freedom,
and is something that “profes-
sional patriots” never learn.

Fear invades schools —
Hutchins

Robert M. Hutchins, associate di-
rector of the Ford Foundation and
former chancellor of the Univer-
sity of Chicago, said in an article
in Look magazine of March 9

“Education is impossible in
many parts of the United States
today because free inquiry and
free discussion are impossible. In
these communities, the teacher of
economics, history or political sci-
ence cannot teach. Even the teach-
er of literature must be careful.

“Competence or professional
skill will not protect the teacher.
In the investigations that have

Only if every single citizen feels
duty bound to do his share in this
defense are the constitutional
rights secure. Thus, a duty is im-
posed on everyone which no one
must evade, notwithstanding the
risks and dangers for him and his
family. . . .

“It is therefore in the present
situation especially important for
the intellectuals to do their duty.
I see this duty in refusing to co-
operate in any undertaking that
violates the constitutional rights
of the individual. This holds in
particular for all inquistions that
are concerned with the private
life and the political affiliations
of the citizens. Whoever cooper-
ates in such a case becomes an
accessory to acts of violation or
invalidation of the Constitution.”

---------Editorial---------------------------------

Why—academic freedom week

Next week UC students and organizations will be participat-
ing in the activities of Academic Freedom Week. The idea
for the Academic Freedom Week stems from a suggestion
of the National Executive Committee of the US National Stu-
dent Association (NSA), that an academic freedom week be
sponsored by member schools.

Without further aid from the NSA many students have
taken up the call and instituted academic freedom weeks
on their campuses. Briefly, the MAROON has tried to docu-
ment the extent of these activities, showing how students
throughout the country are meeting the grave threats to the
integrity of American education. These threats — McCarthy-
ism, abusive Congressional inquiries, and fear itself — have
done much damage to American education.

Teachers are often summarily fired, not for being supposed-
ly “subversive,” but for being just controversial, as Robert M.
Hutchins notes in his recent article in Look magazine. Stu-
dents and faculty members alike are often fearful of expres-
sing their views.

These attacks on free education have consequences that
have become almost too well known to fully enumerate here.
But what is not as well known is what is being done to meet
these attacks.

The Robin Hood movement on Midwest campuses started
about a. month ago at the University of Indiana. Now, thou-
sands of students at Indiana, the University of Michigan, the
University of Wisconsin, Northwestern University, Roosevelt
College, UC, and other schools are wearing the green feather
buttons which means their wearers are opposed to McCarthy-
ism and book censorship. At Indiana the slogan is: “They
are your books, don’t let McCarthy burn them!”

The academic freedom week activities show the widespread
concern for the principles of academic freedom.

One of such activity, the circulation of a scroll of the Bill
of Rights, to be signed by students and faculty members is
indicative of this. Your signature on this document will show
your concern for the neglect of the Bill of Rights by the Mc-
Carthy’s, Jenner’s, Velde’s, et al.

Next week’s activities at UC are not an isolated phenomena.
They are only a part of the growing nation-wide sentiment
to preserve free education and safeguard our basic rights.

“Universities have flagrantly n°t be omitted from education,
except through falsity, distortion

abused their responsibility to
their scholars by dismissing teach-
ers merely because they have in-
voked the Fifth Amendment,” Dr.
Harold Taylor, president of Sarah
Lawrence College, declared.

Taylor, speaking at Columbia
University at a meeting of the stu-
dent committee on academic free-
dom, recommended that these five
principles be accepted by boards
of trustees:

1)	A scholar has the same
rights and duties as any citizen.

2)	Scholars should themselves
decide on the appointment or dis-
missal of their colleagues.

3)	Teachers should not be treat-

or concealment. ...”

“What can we ask of our teach-
ers? We can demand the fairest
possible presentation of a prob-
lem—of all sides of a problem. We
must demand for our children the
freest exploration of ideas. That
is not what vocal pressure groups
are yammering about. They want
only their side presented, and
anybody who suggests that there
is another side is likely to lose
his livelihood and his reputation.”

Freedom disintegrating —
Commager

Speaking before 400 students
last month at an intercollegiate
conference on “The Nature of
American Freedom” at Sarah
Lawrence College, Henry Steele
Commager, professor of American
history at Columbia University
and noted historian, said that
some of the basic characteristics
of American freedom were in dan-
ger of disintegrating, taking our
freedoms with them.

lowing reply to questions on civil
.liberties and academic freedom
submitted to him by 200 educa-
tors:

“The threat to academic free-
dom in our time must be seen in
the fact that, because of the al-
leged external danger to our coun-
try, freedom of teaching, mutual
exchange of opinions, and free-
dom of press and other media of

communication a r

America has been its ability

by creating a situation in which
people feel their economic posi-
tions endangered. Consequently,
more and more people avoid ex-
pressing their opinion freely, even
in their private social life. This
is a state of affairs which a demo-
cratic government cannot survive
in the long run.

“The strength of the Constitu-

New Jersey polls students

“If you’re blase about McCarthy and what he
stands for, don’t read any further,” begins an edi-
torial in The Caellian, (January 14,1954) the news-
paper at New Jersey College for Women. Discussing
an academic freedom poll taken at the College, it
says, “We found it reassuring to hear that most
of the students polled were on the right side of
the fence. Sixty-two per cent of the school dis-
agrees with the policy of dismissing college profes-
sors who refuse to testify, according to the sta-
tistics.”

However, the editorial continues, “the results
of the survey leave us rather skeptical... it seems
to indicate a general lack of awareness. For ex-
ample: nine per cent believed that no one had been
suspended from Rutgers as a result of refusing to
submit to investigations.”

Daily Kansan attacks McCarthy

In an editorial forming part of a full page spread
— “McCarthyism: Its Meaning, Its Method, Its
Man” — the March 31, 1954, issue of the University
Daily Kansan, the University of Kansas student
newspaper said, “As to McCarthy’s objectives,
what he hopes to accomplish, only he knows the
real answer. From all indications, and because of
the devices he employs, we would go along with
the idea that he is out for what he can get for
McCarthy, as much as for what he can do to
fight communism.

“But if they (the American People) think that
democracy can survive without its being pushed
down their throats, they had better withdraw their
support of McCarthy and what he stands for.,

“McCarthy has come more and more in recent
months to be considered a demogogue by his politi-
cal associates, and is not in too strong a position
at the present time. But you can depend on a man
of his dynamic personality and motivation to find
another flag to wave in the near future.”

Daily Texan supports protest

At the University of Texas, in connection with
the student protest of a scheduled McCarthy speech
(reported on page six), The Daily Texan said, “We
have no doubt but that the speech to be made by
the Republican from Wisconsin will follow an al-
ready set pattern, calling for government investi-
gations and repressions in just about every area
of society, implying thought-control tactics and
techniques. In this stand he may be representing
the viewpoint of the San Jacinto chapter of the
Sons of the Republic of Texas, but he is not rep-
resenting the whole of the state. Other Texans
feel so deeply their heritage of freedom, including
freedom of thought, for which their ancestors

fought at San Jaquito, that they are again willing
to fight when they see that freedom threatened.
To them Senator McCarthy, with his tactics of blan-
ket accusations, guilt by association, and demon-
strated demagoguery, represents a threat to their
freedom. In no sense can he represent them, and
in no way could their viewpoint have been con-
sidered by those who picked him for the San Jac-
into Day speech.”

Hunter Arrow questions censorship

At Queen’s College, New York, the Student
Council voted to suspend any newspaper on their
campus printing an advertisement submitted by
any group on the Attorney General’s “subversive
organizations list.” Commenting on this action in
their March 8 issue, the Hunter College Arrow
said, "We feel that the Queens Student Council, in
taking this step, has seriously retarded academic
freedom on their campus. We also feel that they
have become a part of the prevailing hysteria that
condemns groups and individuals as guilty before
they have been legally proven so.

“By delivering this ultimatum and delivering
policy to them the Student Council is severely lim-
iting the school newspaper’s usefulness. To hon-
estly discharge its duties to the student body, the
college paper must be free to print all sides of
every issue. It is the great American Tradition,
substantiated by law, that anyone, regardless of

whether he is right or wrong, be
opportunity to express his opinions.”

Cynic criticizes suspensions

The Vermont Cynic (March 25)

versify of Vermont commented on

granted the

at the Uni-
a resolution

before the University Senate to end the Univer-
sity policy of suspending professors who invoke
the Fifth Amendment.

The editorial, which treated mainly legal aspects
of the resolution, concluded by saying, “Any dis-
missal of a faculty member should be made not
on the basis of'political views; it should be made
only on the basis of his teaching ability, i.e.—his
ability to present material in a manner which is
not inimical to free inquiry.

“Fire him because he is a poor teacher, not be-
cause he is a good Communist.”

Stockton scores fear ^®l^*

The Stockton College, California Collegian, in an
editorial entitled “Are You Afraid to Think” said,
“Students have actually been denied jobs and com-
missions in the Armed Forces because they joined
an organization or attended a meeting.

“Young people go to college to think. If they are
being scared out of thinking, an offense is being
taken against their freedoms.”

THE CHICAGO MAROON

April 9, 1954

To observe Holy Week at UC

Religious services at Rockefeller Chapel, DeSales House, and other University chapels, discussions by student
religious organizations, and a Bach oratorio will mark this year's campus observances of the Christian Holy Week.

Closing the Lenten season, Holy Week commemorates the last seven days in the life of Christ. On Palm Sunday
1,924 years ago Christ entered Jerusalem heralded by throngs of his palm-bearing followers. The period from
Palm Sunday to Good

Friday corresponds to
the period of Christ's
ordeal in Jerusalem, his ar-
rest, trial and subsequent
condemnation to crucifixion.
Maundy Thursday marks the Last
Supper after which Christ, while
praying in the Garden 'of Olives,
was kissed upon the cheek by
Judas; the kiss gave the signal for
Roman soldiers to seize Christ
and take him to the home of Pon-
tius Pilate, where he was con-
demned.

The period from noon to 3 p.m.
on Good Friday commemorates
the period during which Christ
hung on the cross before dying, a
time during which, according to
tradition, the noonday sun turned
black. Easter Sunday marks the
morning of Christ’s Resurrection,
ending the Lenten season and pre-
paring for the forty day period
leading to Christ’s Ascension.

On Palm Sunday the University
of Chicago Choir, conducted by

"Everyman", a medieval morality play of the fifteenth century, will be presented Monday at 8:30 p.m.
in Rockefeller Memorial Chapel. The Bond Chapel Choir will accompany the action. The play is sponsored
cents for students. Tickets are available at Chapel office. The director is Arthur Peterson, Jr. Admission is fifty
cents for students. Tickets are available a Chapel office.

Evanston World Council of
Churches Convention.

The Methodist and Baptist
groups will both co operate with
the Rockefeller services. On April
11 after their 6 p.m. supper the
Methodists will hold a debate with
negative and positive answers to
the question “Does the Church
have any effect upon society?’’

The First Unitarian Church.
57th and Woodlawn will hold 11
a.m. Palm Sunday and Easter
services and a special Tenebrae
service at 7:30 Thursday. The
Tenebrae service, a choral liturgy
similar in many respects to
Roman Catholic and Lutheran
Tenebrae services begins with the
announcement by the full choir:
“Tenebrae factae sunt’’ (Darkness
came upon the earth.) At the first
sound of the choir, an acolyte
moves to put out one of the altar
candles, an omen of the gathering
shadows. In the steadily diminish-
ing light of altar and church, the

Robert Vikstrom, will present
Bach’s oratorio, The Passion Ac-
cording to St. John, 3 p.m. at
Rockefeller. The choir will be ac-
companied by members of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra and
will feature as soloists Dorothy
Linden Krieg, soprano; Evelyn
Reynolds, contralto; John Toms,
tenor; Bernard Izzo, baritone; An-
drew Foldi, bass, and Heinrich
Fleischer, organist.

The 11 a.m. Palm Sunday Ser-
ice at Rockefeller will have as a
speaker Reverend Wallace W.
Robbins, president of the Mead-
ville Theological School. The
Rockefeller 7:30 p.m. services
throughout the week will have as
sermon topics “God in the Void,”
discussed by Reverend Robbins on
Tuesday, “God the Enemy,” by
Reverend William N. Hawley on
Wednesday, and “God the Friend”
by Reverend John B. Thompson
on Maundy Thursday. At the
three hour service beginning at

Thursday commemorates the in-
stitution of the Sacrament of the
Eucharist and will be observed by
an 8 a.m. mass. The Good Friday
Mass of the Presanctified and Tre
Ore will be held from noon to 3
p.m. The Vigil Service and Mass
will begin at 11 p.m. Saturday and
last until early Easter morning,
the morning of the Resurrection.
Easter Sunday, April 18, will be
observed by three masses at 8:30,
10, and 11 a.m.

Episcopal Holy Week observ-
ances in Bond Chapel will begin
at 8:30 a.m. on Palm Sunday with
the Distribution of Palms and the
mass, Missa Penitentialis, featur-
ing traditional Medieval music.
The gospel, the story of the Pas-
sion according to St. Matthew,
will be presented in a dramatic
form with a spoken narration and
musical responses by three male
cantors. At the beginning of the
ceremony palms are blessed and

given to members of the congre-
gation who carry them through-
out the ceremony and keep them
in their home throughout Holy
Week. The Easter mass, which will
be given at 8:30 Easter'morning,
will be Missa Paschalis. Following
both services will be breakfasts
in Thorndike Hilton Chapel. Other
Lutheran Services will be Lenten
Vespers Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday at 5 p.m., a Tenebrae
service on Friday at 5 p.m., and
a Holy Communion on Easter
Sunday at 10 a.m. Choral Vespers
for Easter Eve will be presented
by the Lutheran Student Parish
in Rockefeller Chapel Saturday
at 7 p.m. The Holy Saturday Ves-
pers, presented by the Lutherans
in Rockefeller only once before,
are an extremely elaborate litur-
gical service dating back to the
fifth century. Included in the
service is the chanting of ancient

prophecies and the blessing and
kindling of the Paschal candle,
the light of which represents the
resurrection. The large Paschal
candle was carved by students
from International House.

Funds collected at the Saturday
vespers will go to the World Uni-
versity Service organization.

The Disciples of Christ will hold
Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday
services at the Universal Disciples
of Christ Church, 57th and Uni-
versity, with Communion at 10:30
a.m. and a worship service at 11
a.m. With scriptures, music, and
litanies orientated around a theme
of Holy Week, the sermon topics,
“Jesus, Hope of the World,” and
“The Christian in His Vocation”
are part of a series of sermons
with themes suggested by the

Tenebrae forecasts, in its ancient
ritual, the impending tragedy of
Good Friday.

Prophetic psalms of warning
and of consolation, sung by the
men’s choir, alternate with motets
and chorales for mixed voices by
Palestrina, are put out one at a
time, leaving burning at the last
only the center candle, in token of
the final isolation of Jesus on the
cross. As the choir sings the cho-
rale, “O sacred head sore wound-
ed,” this light is carried out leav-
ing the church in the darkness of
rejection and death. The light is
returned, in affirmation of the
triumph of the sacrifice. The Bible
is closed; the tragedy is accom-
plished. The benediction is pro-
nounced.

The Biblical responses will be
read and the benediction given by
the Reverend Leslie T. Penning-
ton. The acolytes of the ceremony
will be students of the Meadville
Theological Seminary.

noon Friday, Professor Joseph
Sittier will speak on “The Seven
Last Words.” The Easter morning
service will begin at 11 a.m.

The Blessing and Distribution
of Palms at the 8:30 a.m. Palm
Sunday Mass will begin the week’s
Roman Catholic observance at De-
Sales House, 5735 University Ave-
nue; other Palm Sunday masses
will be given at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.
Tenebrae Services, an account in
words and music of the world’s
rejection of the Light will be held
from April 14-16 at 8 p.m. Holy

The Renaissance Society of the University of Chicago is holding at the Goodspeed Gal-
1erie$ ^n^,xT^l lon ° contemporary paintings, prints, and drawings in memory of Elinor
Castle Nef. It seems as if one of the coffers of of the deceased Mrs. Nef, containing souvenirs
of her world-wide travels had been suddenly unpacked revealing a most haphazard collection
of a few excellent and mostly mediocre paintings. The collection itself could perhaps only
be understood thiough Mrs. Nefs biography, since these paintings were not collected with
a certain topic or particular-

interest in mind. To one who
is not familiar with her life,
any criticism must fall on individ-
ual paintings rather than the col-

The program is composed of three

Seeger shines in second concert

Singing and playing his banjo to a packed house in Mandel Hall last Saturday night, Pete
Seeger was his usual entertaining self, playing his selections with an assurance that would
do credit to any performer, folk or otherwise.

The numbers varied from modern parodies dealing with current events (“This is the
Army, Pvt. Schine”) to old Elizabethan ballads. In many instances Seeger preceded his
songs with some historical background which often gave a deeper meaning to an apparently

simple number. As at his ap-
pearance here last February,
many songs were selected to
exemplify man’s universal fight
for freedom. The most notable
ones of this type last Saturday
were “Die Gedanken Sind Frei”
and “Tzena.” Often the audience
was invited to participate in the
singing, and the response was ter-
rific.

Also featured on the program
was Ella Jenkins, who sang and
played an Afro-Cuban drum. Al-
though not singing strictly Afro-
Cuban music, she was quite en-
joyable, and her explanations
greatly illuminated a field of folk
music which is almost unknown in
the U. S. Her voice had little to

of the personalities on which
they concentrated.

Miss Alton’s Julia lacked the
pride and arrogance which is such
a real part of the character, but
portrayed the mentally broken
Miss Julia with striking authen-
ticity. In the same way Mr. Asner
sacrificed the more honest side of
Jean to portray the selfish, con-
niving, and ambitious aspects of
that character. Joyce Hiller
brought conviction and under-
standing to the role of Christine,
the cook. The director of the play,
Elaine May, seems to have em-
ployed a method more or less new
to Playwrights; that of coming to
task with each and every specific
problem of meaning and interpret-
ation presented by the play. One
might disagree with her inter-
pretation, but no one could help
but praise and admire the result-
ing high quality of sincerity and
completeness which both the play
and players presented. All in all,
Miss Julia is the most professional
production Playwright’s has yet
presented, with the possible ex-
ception of its own curtain raiser,
The Marriage Proposal.

Despite all the opening night
hazards, including tottering
scenery, The Marriage Proposal
was delightful. Eugene Troob-
nick, who is excellent in this
type of comedy role, could not
have hoped for a more talented
partner than Elaine May. Paul
Sills completed the triumvirate.
With a flurry of shouts, Rus-
sian accents, twitches, and wild
gestures (and none of them go-
ing too far) Playwright’s pre-
sented what, in this reviewer’s
opinion, is the most enjoyable
production of its career.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Trackmen trounce Teachers;
End year defeated only once

by Justin Johnson _ ...

The Varsity Track Team wound up their indoor season last Saturday with a decisive vic-
tory over Wisconsin State Teachers College (Milwaukee) at the UC Fieldhouse. Five meet
records were smashed and another tied as Chicago piled up points resulting in a 67%-28}4

final score.

Hal Higdon started things rolling with a 4:27.7 mile, breaking the old mark, with Captain
Walt Deike coming up fast at the finish for second place. In the 60-yard dash, Frank Loomis

and Dave Shepherd had to be
content with second and third,
but came right back in the
880-relay with Phil Wyatt and
Justin Johnson to set a new record
in this event. The winning time
was 1:33.1.

Maroons sweep hurdles

In the high hurdles, Johnson
ran :09.1, knocking two-tenths of
a second off the record set in 1952
by a former Chicago runner. Vern
Gras. Dan Trifone and Sherry
Gray completed the three-man
sweep in this event.

Taking their cue from the hur-
dlers, the two-mile trio of Jim
Flynn, Paul Baptist, and Ray-
Sanders slammed their event,
with Flynn leading his teammates
around the track in 10:22.4. The
two-mile relay team of Art Omo-
hondro, Arnie Meardon. Higdon
and Ken Stapley had little trouble
winning their event in 8:13.1.
Loomos finished his indoor low

hurdling for this season with a
record-setting :08.4 performance.

Howard wins shot put

In the field events, Maroonmen
were also piling up points for Chi-
cago. Joe Howard, throwing 42'
11%", won the shot put. with
Roger Forsythe settling for sec-
ond place. The high jump ended
in a four-way tie for first but
Chicago had Bob Mason, Trifone,
and Johnson in there to insure a
3-1 split of honors. Shepherd and
Johnson had to be satisfied with
second and third in th£ broad
jump. In the final event the Chi-

Wright emphasized that the
“compromise” policy which India
suggests necessitates a precon-
dition of willingness to comprom-
ise. Yet he said, Communists have
been unwilling to compromise, as
we saw in Korea and Tibet. The
Indian outlook is unreal and un-

timately lose herself by a “mis-

through a mistake."

Need 'positive settlements'

To his claim that aggression
understands only force Wright
added the argument that the UN
offers the same mediating appa-
ratus which India proposes, with
an additional feature of collective
security. “A lukewarm attitude of
India toward aggressor nations
only demoralized other UN na-
tions."

India’s “negative position" was
assailed by Keno, who claimed
that no discussion for the purpose
of preventing war is satisfactory;
what we need, he said, are “posi-
tive settlements." “It is only," he
said, “when power hungry Com-
munists see by collective action
of the free nations of the world
that they cannot overrun the
world; it is only then that we will
achieve a lasting peace.”

Maroon nine, North Central
battle 6 innings, tie 6 each
by Lennie Friedman

Maroon efforts for an opening day baseball victory at Stagg Field were stymied by a late
inning North Central rally which resulted in a 6-6 tie. The ball game, called because of dark-
ness after six innings featured the brilliant two-hit pitching of Charles Youngquist and the
able ballplaying of Wendell Marumoto and Walt Walker.

The first scheduled game of the year, last Saturday against Wright Junior College, was
cancelled because of snow and cold.

Monday afternoon against
North Central, Coach Kyle
Anderson started a veteran
lineup, plus the rookie battery of
Youngquist and Walker who more
than justified Anderson’s trust in
them.. Youngquist’s pitching per-
formance was .highlighted by
striking-out five North Central
batters and allowing only two
runs in five innings. Walker ably
caught Youngquist and kept early
season, wildness down to a mini-
mum.

Maroon* take early lead

The Maroons tallied early
against a succession of three
North Central pitchers to take a
6-2 lead by the fourth inning. The
first Maroon run was scored by
Marumoto who walked, stole sec-

ond, and advanced to third on an
infield out. Dave Utley was hit by
a pitched ball and Bob Mann sin-
gled to score Marumoto.

Shortstop Marumoto sparked
the second run by leading off in
the third inning with a base hit
and a stolen base. George Gray’s
base hit scored Marumoto for the
second tally. Utley reached first
base via a North Central error
and pushed Grey into scoring posi-
tion. A clutch hit by Gil Levine
scored him.

Score three in fourth

In the fourth inning the last
three runs were scored. Walker
led off with a base hit to left,
Youngquist followed with a walk

double between right and center
fields which brought in all base
runners.

North Central found it difficult
to score against starter Young-
quist and collected only two runs
before the sixth inning. When
Youngquist showed fatigue, John
Broyles was brought in to hold
the four run Chicago lead. But
Broyles wrenched his back and
when he had to rely on his slow
stuff, was clobbered for four
quick runs. A throw by second
sacker Mann and a fancy tag by
Walker resulted in the third out,
saving Broyles from further pun-
ishment.

Marumoto stars on basepaths

Marumoto demonstrated some
fine baserunning during the
game. The 128 pound shortstop on
a dash from third to home found
a 180 pound pitcher blocking his
path. An instant later the pitcher
was fouhd sprawling on the
ground. After the pitcher was
taken out, Marumoto was last
seen behind the strongest Ma-
roons timidly peeking out to see
if any North Central players were
after him.

Utley’s double was the strong-
est Maroon blow of the day. Mann
showed the same form that has
kept him a starter on former Ma-
roon teams. Youngquist’s blazing
fast ball and slick curve made him
a starting pitcher in Anderson’s
book.

The advent of spring weather has brought about a great increase
of activity among UC sailors. The Sailing Club’s boat is receiving
its final coat of paint, and is expected to be in use within a few days.
Old members of the Sailing Club are brushing up on their racing
tactics, while neophytes are being primed on the duties of a crewman.

This quarter the UC team, a regular member of the Midwest Col-
legiate Sailing Association (MCSA) will compete in five official
regattas, opposing a total of 26 schools, including Notre Dame, Mar-
quette, and several Big Ten colleges. Their first competition is in
the MCSA Invitational which will be held on the University of Mich-

Chess-men checkmate Navy Pier

While it may require less energy than hitting a home-run or steer-
ing a sailing craft through the waves, chess is a game that requires
concentration. And the UC Chess Club must certainly have been con-
centrating last Friday night. They defeated a team from the Uni-
versity of Illinois, Navy Pier branch, in the Burton Library, four
games to none, one match being a draw.

Jim Phillips, Burton Weinstein, Larry Abrahams and Bob Floyd
each won their matches. Bob Shapiro and his Illini opponent faced
each other for several hours but neither man could gain an advantage.
When the night-watchman came to lock the doors, they decided to
call the match a draw.

last Thursday, but the final tallies gave the junior Maroons 66-1/3,
Morton 53-1/3, and Mendel 5. In the high-jump Watkins made 5'11",
in the broad-jump 20'4", both first places. He won the low hurdles
in :08.9, placed second in the highs, and was a member of the winning
relay team.

In the Oak Park Relays March 27, Watkins again starred as his
team fared poorly. He took fourth places in both the broad and high
jumps. The sprint medley team placed fifth.

Spring inframurals to start soon

Team entries for intramural softball will close Friday, April 16,
according to intramural director Kooman Boycheff. Play in college,
divisional, and fraternity house leagues will begin soon after, and
so all students interested in forming and entering teams should pick
up applications this week from the IM office, Bartlett 105.

All-University tournaments in golf, horseshoes, and tennis are also
scheduled this spring, and information and applications for these
are available in Bartlett 105. Medals will be awarded to winners in
all three tourneys. Students, faculty members, and employees except-
ing those competing on official Chicago teams are eligible to enter.

Gymnasts tumbled in top meet

Three of Coach Bub Beyer’s star gymnasts took on some of the
■ best competition in the country in the National Collegiate champion-
ships last weekend. The matches, which were held at Huff Gym-
nasium on the University of Illinois campus in Champaign, saw
Bob Herndon and Ron Graham competing in the trampoline. Herndon
was eliminated in the preliminaries, while Graham lost in the medal-
ist category. Herb Taylor, competing in the all-around event fared
better, but did not qualify for the finals.
