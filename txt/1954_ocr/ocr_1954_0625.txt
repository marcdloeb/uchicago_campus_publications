'Disorderly, but very much alive' —
This University and ancient Greece
When Hutchins, Adler. McKeon, et al, set out to inculcate the
UC student body in- the Greek classics, it is doubtful if they
thought that their University would ever be compared—and
favorably, at that—with the Hellenes.

Lucien Price recording the dialogues of Alfred North White-
head (Little, Brown and Co., Boston, 1954, $5.00) reports that
the ancient Greeks achieved a high cultural level despite the
sordid atmosphere of some of their cities. They had murders,
he admits, but they got things done.

Then Whitehead added: “I fancy the place I have been in that
was most like Greece was a gathering of university scholars at
Chicago. The city was disorderly but very much alive.”

Where is the Cap and Gown?

'Turn Me Over When I'm Done' . . .

LJC’ers face campus crisis
of yearbook nonappearance

by MitchaM Siem

A mystery with complexing and baffling overtones has hit
the University of Chicago campus. Although not as intriguing
as some of the contemporary who-done-its, it has the student
body wondering. The question is simply: “Where is the Cap
and Gown?”

Gil Ginsburg says as be stretches out under the heat wave, grassy surfaces surrounding the cam-
Midway sun. As summer school started and the pus were littered with students seeking sun and
city neaftd the second week of its 90 degree plus sleep.

Language courses here

use new teaching method

This , summer the annual Linguistic Institute of the Linguistic Society of America is being
held here in cooperation with the University of Chicago. During the eight-week meeting of
the Institute, a faculty from American and European universities will offer a variety of
courses relating to the central theme: Linguistics and Philosophy.

In addition, the Institute is introducing to the University two intensive language courses
taught by the “Army” or “oral-aural” method, which was developed for the Army during

World War II by the Linguis-
tic Society of America. This
summer the intensive lan-
guage program includes a course
in Russian and a course in English
for Latin-Americans and Eastern
Europeans.

The directors of the language
program, Gordon Fairbanks of
Cornell University and Miss An-
gela Paratore of Indiana Univer-
sity, described the theory and
practice of the rural method of
language teaching.

Language composed of habit*

Language is essentially a skill
composed of at least two sets of
habits. The problem of language
teaching is that of imparting a
skill, which involves imitation of
an expert, in this case, a native
speaker of the language and ex-
tensive repetition and practice.

In this respect the method at-
tempts to duplicate in the class-
room the conditions under which
a child normally learns his native
language. However, since the stu-
dent is an adult who has acquired
one important skil, the ability of
speech in his own language, no
attempt is made to avoid the use
of his language where under-
standing may be facilitated by so
doing.

ChildrM loam by imitation

Children learn language purely
by imitation, but a college student
may be given explanations in his
own language that will increase
his speed in learning the lan-
guage.

In the summer courses here,

Two fires brighten campus life;

A hot time was had by all

Two fires on campus have highlighted the first week of the
summer quarter. Both fires occurred Monday, one in the base-
ment of the business school and the other in the pantry of
Kelly Hall.

Both fires caused little damage. The Haskell fire damage is
still undetermined. According to Mrs. Eva Sutherland, assistant
to the director of the School of Business, the fire started in
the jacket of a janitor who was on vacation.

The jacket was on a chair in ihe building basement and only
the jacket and chair were damaged. Four fire engines were on
hand for the noon hour blaze.

A faulty mechanism on a refrigerator caused the Kelly fire.
Miss Charlotte Ellenwood, househead of Kelly, discovered the
fire and reported that the icebox will have to be replaced.

Give issue dates

The Maroon will publish two
more times during the sum-
mer, on July 16 and on August
6. Then, like the University, we
will vacation until Orientation
Week.

four hours a day are devoted to
language study, one of which con-
sists of explanations in the stu-
dent’s native language by a com-
petent linguist. The rest of the
time is devoted to workshops, in
which records and native speak-
ers are used in order to give the
students familiarity with the lan-
guage as it is spoken. These three
hours are devoted almost entirely
to aural practice, all explanatory
material of a theoretical nature
being reserved for the first hour.
Material may be limited

At almost no time are sounds,
words, or phrases learned which
are not independently meaningful
and directly applicable to some
situation in which the speaker is
likely to be involved. In this man-
ner, everything which the student
learns is known fluently, even
though the amount of material
might be quite limited. While un-
der the traditional method of lan-
guage teaching, the student usu-
ally acquires a large fund of
“passive vocabulary” prior to the
time that he is able to speak with
any degree of fluency; under this
method, the student has an “ac-

tive” and fluent use of everything
he learns.

Tests given to two groups of
students taught under the two
above methods indicate that after
360 hours of study, students
taught under the new method not
only speak the language far more
fluently than those taught under
the old method, but that the two
groups of students have approxi-
mately equal proficiency in read-
ing the language.

Language teachers in general
are becoming more and more con-
vinced that a speaking knowledge
of a language is a necessary foun-
dation for proficiency in reading
and writing the language. The in-
tensive language courses being
offered here this summer might
be considered a laboratory for
demonstration of that proposition.

Lawson gives
physics for
nomscientists

The physics department of the
division of physical science has in-
stituted a new course designed for
non-physics majors. It is listed as
physics 299.

Essentially the course will be
conducted on a non-mathematical
basis. No prerequisites are re-
quired for enrolling in the class.
Physics 299 will be conducted dur-
ing the first half of the quarter
and students will receive one-half
course credit.

Professor Andrew W. Lawson
will conduct the main part of the
course. However, most of the ses-
sions will be devoted to talks by
other members of the faculty.
They will discuss the experiment-
al developments on which they
are working.

Physics 299 will be a review of
current developments in the field
of modern physics. It will be orien-
tated towards students and teach-
ers of science who have a BS in
physical sciences. It is designed
for students not working toward
a degree in physics. For this rea-
son the emphasis will be on the
content and importance of these
developments rather than a math-
ematical approach.

The Cap and Gown, UCs yearbook, was first expected on
May 15, then May 21, and

late June 15. It is now June 25
and it has not appeared yet.
This has led to many and varied
speculations on the part of those
who have paid for their copies.
The most frequent question is “Is
it really coming out?”

Yearbook is coming out

A spokesman for the Cap and
Gown, who, for obvious reasons
did not want to be named, said
that the yearbook was definitely
coming out, and then added that
there will be a short delay. The
Cap and Gown spokesman did not

Conference analyzes
student life in USA

A four-day conference on “Student Life and Education in
the United States” concluded Wednesday.

Participating in the conference, which was sponsored by
the UC Committee on International Exchanges in cooperation
with the Conference Board of Associated Research Councils,
were educators from all over the United States and the nations

in Western Europe, the Middle
East and Asia.

Opening the conference was
George Stoddard, former presi-
dent of the University of Illinois
and presently with the office of
institutional research and educa-
tional planning at New York Uni-
versity. Stoddard discussed “The
Development of Educational Pat-
terns in the United States,” trac-
ing the development of public,
adult, women’s and technical edu-
cation in America.

Fisk president speaks

Other major addresses were
given by Charles S. Johnson, pres-
ident of Fisk University, who dis-
cussed “Curricular and Extra-
curricular Education,” and by
Helen White, professor of Eng-
lish at the University of Wiscon-
sin, whose speech class dealt with
“Conceptions of the Responsibili-
ties of the Educated Person.”

against the yearbook’s editor and
staff unless action is undertaken
immediately.

Distribution problem arises

A real problem has arisen in
the distribution of the Cap and
Gown. Many of the students in
residence this summer have
moved and want their books sent
to the new address, when it finally
comes out. They are advised to
phone the Cap and Gown office
and instruct the staff accordingly.

And so the problem remains.
Where is Cap and Gown? When
will it appear, that is, if it does.
The MAROON will publish again
in three weeks, and will let you
know if it has come out by then.

Several UC faculty members
participated in the conference.
Richard P. McKeon, Charles F.
Grey, distinguished service pro-
fessor of philosophy, who discus-
sed the problem of “Human Val-
ues Versus Technology” in Amer-
ican education. Robert M. Stro-
zier, dean of students, chaired the
conference.

Southern college papers
defend Court decision

The recent segregation decision of the Supreme Court has had
reactions in certain areas of the South that would seem more con-
structive and promising than those of southern political leaders
reported in the newspapers.

That is, if comments on the court decision from the student news-
papers at the University of North Carolina and the Alabama Poly-
technic Institute are actually representative of student opinion on
ibis important issue.

The Daily Tar Heel of the University of North Carolina, probably
the most enlightened campus paper in the south, has this to say about
the recent ruling. “Southern schools, this University among them,
must now face the truth—that ‘separate but equal’ is a meaningless
phrase, that places of learning, if separate, are inherently unequal.

“We hold this one—like those other great truths declared in our
Constitution—to be self-evident: It is time to stop postponing brother-
hood. This is a time for the turning of thought and opinion into wide,
new channels, a time for the yielding of old prejudices and ignorant
discrimination before the patient and powerful light of Christianity.

“South Carolina’s Governor Byrnes and many like him in the
Routh, many of them our friends and people we love, now stand
eclipsed. Their South is gone, or it is going, and the bitterness and
antagonism no longer seem very significant, though we do not deny
khat there is bitterness yet to be overcome before perfect equality
is achieved, even in North Carolina, even in Chapel Hill. It is simply
that the path is now very clear indeed, and for the Southern states
and the University, there is no other path, though we be emotionally
reluctant at first to follow it.”

Alabama Polytechnic Institute's Plainsman editorialized, “Segrega-
tion will continue in Alabama for some time. Reform will be a gradual
process, not sudden. Therefore, the ruling is not a signal for ‘hot-
heads’ to scatter their own peculiar brand of hell. There are some of
Us who are outraged merely for the sake of notoriety.

“Here on our campus, liberalism extends beyond the boundaries
of that exemplified by the population of the state. Racial equality
has occurred in the armed services without violence. Likewise, there
will be very little antagonism over the mingling of minds on an
educational problem.”

Letters...

No cash for LAK

The statements of Chancellor
Kimpton and his cohorts have con-
vinced me of one thing: so long as
that man is heading the university
I will not contribute one cent to
Ms support. His insulting of the
Student body and his destruction
of the slowly constructed tradition
of scholarship (for which the
school was known) have indicated
that he is not only a nihilist, but
Also a coward. He is kowtowing
to what he believes to be the pub-
lic concept of education, not seem-
ing to realize that the public does
pot have a very clear idea of what
goes on in a university except
from the sports pages of the news-
papers. Evidently Kimpton has
Mot bothered to discover that the
Jife of the average student in
gny institution of higher learning
does not involve many sports;
these are reserved for the trained
experts. The chancellor should be
proud of the intellectual level of
his student body. If these people
are not the leaders of tomorrow
(as he does not seem to think they
are) then we will probably be
headed- for national destruction
through simple stupidity. The
undergraduate enrollment has fal-
len for very good reasons and
not because the students are intel-
Jegent. Even when I started at UC
in 1946 the University was famous
all over the Midwest for its level
of intellect. The real reasons lie
in the inability of students these
days to pay such high tuition and
in the death of imagination evi-
denced by the ascension of such
a low caliber person as Kimpton
to take the place of the highly in-
spirational Hutchins. I think the
firing of Kimpton would do more
for the University than the impor-
tation of the future Chicago Bears.

|£impton describes future
University contributions

Speaking before the two sessions of the spring semester
convocation exercises at Rockefeller Memorial Chapel Fri-
day, June 11,1954, Chancelor Lawrence A. Kimpton addressed
himself primarily to those who were to be future alumni, giv-
ing a brief history of the accomplishments and facilities of UC.

The Chancellor stated that the University contribution to
the future would take four

. spring convocation.

Dr. Peyton Rous, world-renowned cancer authority of the
Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and Joel Stebbins,
• distinguished professor emeritus of astronomy at the Univer-

- sity of Wisconsin, were award-
ed honorary doctor of science
degrees at the University’s

Degrees were conferred on the
two scientists and 734 June grad-

Describes community problems

Kimpton touched upon the prob-
lem of the University community.
He said that if the community can
be rebuilt both commercially and
residentially, and if the commu-
nity can be stabilized so that all
its citizens can live happily to-
gether, the University will have
accomplished something that has
never been done before in any
American city.

“It is not too early perhaps to
say that we are beginning to win
this battle, and when we do, we
will have established a commu-
nity which will serve as a model
for every American city,” Chan-
cellor Kimpton said.

Adds humorous touch

Kimpton’s speech was heavily

Stebbins headed observatory

• Stebbins, director of the Wash-
burn Observatory of the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin from 1922 to his
retirement in 1948, was honored
as "a master in the field of astro-
photometry whose investigations
have greatly contributed to knowl-
edge of the stars and the stellar
systems.”

A pioneer in the adaptation of
photoelectric techniques to astro-
nomical research, Stebbins deter-
mined the accurate colors of early
type stars. This has been the basis
for present knowledge of the
structure of the galaxy. His early
discoveries have also been impor-
tant in knowledge of the evolution
of stars and the structure of the
universe.

Both Dr. Rous and Stebbins are
members of the National Acad-
emy of Sciences. Dr. Rous re-
ceived the John Scott medal and
the Walker prize of the Royal
College of Surgeons. Stebbins re-
ceived the Bruce medal of the
Astronomical Society of the Pa-
cific and the gold medal of the
Royal Astronomical Society.

UC get funds
for research

The University of Chicago has
received a pledge of $15,000 for
its Cancer Research Center. The
pledge was made by the Herbert
A. Gorney Cancer Foundation.

The pledge, to be presented by
Harry Cohn, president of the
Foundation, will be used to sup-
port the center’s department of
anesthesiology. Last month the
Gorney Foundation presented an
electronic device that checks the
heart beat, brain waves, breathing
rate, blood pressure, pulse, and
body temperature during an oper-
ation. It is to be used during the
course of cancer and other oper-
ations.

Presentation of the money took
place during the annual dinner
dance meeting of the 500 member
organization in the Red Lacquer
Room of the Palmer House last
Sunday, June 20.

Teller, 'fabulous teacher/

testifies at AEC hearing

The man who has been described by his colleagues as “a fabulous physics 105-6-7 instruc-
tor” and as “The father of the H-bomb” was the leading witness against the A-bomb’s father,
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

The Atomic Energy Commission released Teller’s testimony which played a leading part
in denying Oppenheimer security clearance. Teller told the AEC that the Princeton scientist

was a loyal American who would not willingly breach security regulations. But judging by
his conduct, Teller said, “one---------------------------------------------———------------------—

For Rent

would be wiser not to grant
him security clearance.”

Teller, who taught here from
1934 until 1953, has been described
by UC physicists as “emotional,”
“sensitive,” “brilliant,” and “in-
tensely patriotic.” Teller was a
popular instructor among both
students and faculty, but his work
on the atomic projects at Los
Alamos, New Mexico, caused him
to take more and more frequent
leaves of absence. After the war,
as one professor said, Teller was
living “almost a double life.”
Had conflicts with Oppenheimer

Scientists who knew Teller both
at the Institute for Nuclear Stud-
ies and at Los Alamos said that
Teller and Oppenheimer had “in-

tellectual and moral conflicts.” It
was also said that there was a
professional rivalry between the
two men.

On June 1 — in its controversial
decision — the AEC loyalty board
ruled that Oppenheimer displayed
a “lack of enthusiasm” for work
on the hydrogen bomb, and
“though loyal and discreet (he
was a) security risk.”

These are charges which could
hardly, say the UC scientists, be
leveled against Teller. He “drove
hard, had a fine sense of humor
and an enormous energy for
work.”

Yet some scientists were still
confused by Teller’s action in the
Oppenheimer case.

Alumnus hit

by Army for
UC activity

Membership in three student or-
ganizations at the University of

Chicago has resulted
missal and discharge
instructor at Fort
New Jersey.

Barry A. Miller, a

in the dis-
of a radar
Monmouth,

former UC

student, was demoted from act-
ing corporal to the lowest grade
of private and discharged from
the Army on June 8. The reason
was his membership in the Social-
ist Youth League, a Trotskyite
organization cited as “subversive**
by the Attorney General, and in
the Independent Socialist League,
a splinter group which broke off
from SYL, and was also cited as
“subversive.”

Miller was an SYL member
from 1948 to 1951 and with the
Independent Socialists for a year
after that. Miller was also a mem-
ber of the Politics Club in 1948
and 1949.

Miller’s discharge has been ap-
pealed by Norman Thomas, for-
mer Socialist Party candidate for
President, and by the Defense
League, a legal aid organization
in New York.

At the time of his induction
Miller declined to list his mem-
bership affiliations, but volun-
teered the information at a later
date.

It is not known whether Miller
was one of the persons on Sena-
tor Joseph McCarthy’s list of “se-
curity risks” at Fort Monmouth.
