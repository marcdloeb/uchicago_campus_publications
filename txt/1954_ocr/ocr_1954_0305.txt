SFA court issues SC vacancy decision;
given by The Quadrangle Club declares 'unconstitutionality' of By-Law

This year, for the first time in UC history, the Quadrangle
Club Revels will be presented to an all-campus audience.
“Come Back, Little AB,” this year’s Revels, will take place
in Mandel Hall next Friday, March 12, at 8:30 p.m. The per-
formance will be repeated on Saturday, March 13, for mem-
bers of the Quadrangle Club only.

At present the theme of
“Come Back, Little AB” is
top secret and will not be re-
vealed before the curtain rises.
John Hutchens, chairman of the
department of physiology, who
collaborated with Harry Kalven,
associate professor of the law
school, in writing the show, stated
that, “We’ve broken the all-time
record of ticket sales.” Speaking
as co author he added, “and we
hope that it’s a funny show.” A
few tickets are still available at
Reynolds Club desk for $2.50.

Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimp-
ton will be among those faculty
members'whose dramatic talents
will be displayed in the review.
Also in the cast are Robert M.

Thousand alumni at reunion;

students aid weekend activities

by Robert Quinn and Allen danger	*

“The most successful open house in recent years,” according to Howard Mort, Alumni
secretary, caused an overflow of hundreds of spectators to be turned away last weekend
from the alumni dinner and variety show at the annual mid-year reunion.

Attendance at this year’s reunion was 63 per cent over that 'of last year’s, as more than
1,000 alumni coming not only from Chicago but from six midwest and coastal states returned

to the UC campus. In additior
students acted as either carna-
tion-wearing guides or enter-
tainers in the music-drama-
acrobatics variety show.

“Quantitatively and qualitative-
ly this year’s reunion was by far
our most successful,” stated the
association’s executive director,
Howard Mort, after the excite-
ment of the weekend had subsid-
ed. “Now that business has set-
tled down to normal we can start
planning for the other events on’
this year’s crowded calendar.”
Alumni activities planned

Among the service activities
slated for this year by the associa-
tion are its June reunion and In-
ter-Fraternity sing, student award
dinner, fund - raising campaigns,
class reunions, and half - million
dollai fund-raising campaign.

The association’s most recently
initiated activity is a series of
vocational bull sessions in which
UC students will meet in groups
of 20 with prominent men in vari-
ous occupational fields to discuss

Pinhas Delougax (extreme left,) Curator of the Oriental Institute Mu-
seum and Oriental Institute Associate Professor, explaining the workings
of the Oriental Institute to a group of UC Alumni during o tour of the
Institute during the alumni reunion tost week,.

I. Kirkpatrick, comptroller;
George Watkins, secretary of the
University; Leon Carnovsky, pro-
fessor of the graduate library
school; and Louis Gottschalk, pro-
fessor of the department of his-
tory.

“A very good show,” pronounc-
ed James Carpender, associate
professor of the radiology section,
who is producing “Come Back,

Little AB'

T am pleased to

have produced it.” Hutchens and
Kal ven began writing the review
last October. Rehearsal began
February 1.

Other activities planned for
members of the Quadrangle Club
are a dinner before and a dance
after the show.

t to the work done by alumni
opportunities offered college grad-
uates in those fields. The first of
these sessions will be held April
13 when journalism will be dis-
cussed. Other topics to be covered
during April will be law, teaching,
and advertising.

Through departmental news let-
ters, the University of Chicago
Magazine and the digest - sized
Tower Topics, the association tries
to keep its members up to elate
with “a progressive university
which changes policy with the
seasons.” Daily the association of-
fices are flooded with letters from
curious alumni. A sampling from
Mort’s morning mailbag might
contain a request from alumna in
Keokuk for information about
Russia for her woman’s club,* a
request from a man for the ad-
dress of a long-lost university
friend, and a note from a Tulsa
woman posing the puzzler “What
was the cause of World War II

A vacancy in the Student Government need not be filled by a person from the same
campus political group as the one who resigned to create the vacancy, according to a deci-
sion of the student-faculty-administration court, announced yesterday. .

Aubrey E. Galyon, a member of Student Government (ISL-FTS), had brought the case
to the court. Galyon maintained that the provision of the By-Laws of the Student Govern-
. ment, which dealt with the replacement of vacancies by the Assembly’s executive council,
was incompatible with the SG----------	-------‘

constitution.

The court ruled five to two
in favor of Galyon’s contention.
However, Anton W. DePorte, asso-
ciate justice, explained to the
MAROON that the court rejected
Galyon’s arguments for making
its ruling of unconstitutionality.

DePorte explains opinion

DePorte stated that the court
found the By-Law unconstitu-
tional in examination of the his-
tory of the powers of the execu-
tive council of SG.

DePorte was the author of the
majority opinion. George Kauf-
man, chief justice; Dan Feldman;
Malcolm Sharp, professor of law;

and faculty members over 200

World War HI?”

Alumni raise funds

Organized and directed by an
alumni board, the association co-
ordinates the activities of UC
alumni clubs scattered through-
out the country. In every town
where there are 15 or more UC
alumni, members plan social activ-
ities, assist in student promotion,
and through a personal corftact
campaign assist the yearly cam-
paign to raise funds for the uni-
versity. Members donating more
than one hundred dollars are ad-
mitted to the inner circle of the
association’s exclusive Century
club.

The association also assists
classes of different years in organ-
izing their individual reunions. A
typical reunion might include a
tour, dinner, a baseball game (for
more recent graduates), a talk by
a figure like “Miss Frances” of
NBC-TV Ding Dong school fame
or Arthur Sears Henning, and dis-
play of photographs showing how
alumni looked during their col-

lege days.

Johnson to show
films of travels
with Stevenson

“Around the World with Steven-
son,” a talk by Walter Johnson,
who accompanied Adlai Stevenson
during his recent world tour, will
be given today at 8 p.m. in the
east lounge of International
House. Johnson, chairman of the
UC history department, will speak
before an open meeting of the
International Relations Club.
Films of the Stevenson tour will
also be shown at the meeting.

The talk will feature Johnson’s
observations on his visit to Japan,
Indonesia, India and other nations
of southeast Asia, and his meet-
ings with political and educational
leaders of these countries.

and Robert Woellner, director of
vocational guidance and place-
ment; all concurred in the major-
ity decision.

Meiklejohn dissents

Donald Meiklejohn. associate
professor of philosophy in the
College, and Albert Sciaky dis-
sented. At press time, there had
been no minority opinion written.

The majority opinion explained
how originally the Constitution of
the SG provided that the president
should choose persons for the va-
cancy from among fhree persons
nominated or proposed by re-
maining representatives of the
division in which the vacancy had
been created.

Provision repealed

This provision was repealed by
campus vote and replaced by
granting the executive council the
prerogative for filling vacancies.
Sean OFaolain

heroes'- of six modern writers

Six modern writers’ ideas of “heroes” were examined by
novelist Sean O’Faolain in a lecture in Mandel Hall last Mon-
day. In the works of Graham Greene, Ernest Hemingway,
William Faulkner, Elizabeth Bowen, Evelyn Waugh, and
James Joyce, O’Faolain found evidence of the 20th-century
disintegration of traditional certainties, absolutes, and stereo-

types.

Each author’s work, he said,
superficially concerns the
physical world. “But the modern
novel,” he continued, “is really
concerned with interpretation of
the physical world, with internal,
individual life as it is shaped by

external forces.”

All the authors discussed be-
lieve that “We are born to be
cheated.” However, they express
the belief in various ways. Greene,
for example, emphasizes in his
work a denial of free will (“Hu-
man nature has loaded the dice
against all of us.”) Because of this
pessimistic philosophy, Greene
concentrates again and again nn
themes of betrayal and double-
cross attempting to demonstrate
that faithfulness pays off only in
the next world. Characters in his
novels are puppets who achieve
happiness, if at all, through mys-
tical escape.

Although similar to Greene,
O’Faolain stated, Hemingway por-
trays the assertion of the ego,
rather than its suppression. In
the extraordinary situations Hem-
ingway pictures, the surface char-
acter of the central figure is re-
placed by his real personality.

Faulkner’s novel, too, are dis-
tinguished by high levels of emo-
tion and violence. A romanticist
and pessimist, O’Faolain claimed,
Faulkner treats themes of abused
humanity; his heroes only howl
protests. Actually, depth of feel-
ing rescues Faulkner’s work from
Professor slashed;
robbed of wallet

Edward Bassett, assistant pro-
fessor and secretary of the depart-
ment of classical languages, was
held up and stabbed as he was
walking past the Industrial Re-
lations Center on the corner of
60th and Ellis Avenue last Friday
at 8:30 p.m. Bassett said that he
was robbed of his wallet, which
contained not more than $13, by
four youths of high school age or
slightly older.

Bassett said that he was slashed
on the wrist and slightly on the
thigh and that he went to Billings,
where he received a few stitches
on his wrist. He was not detained
there and was on campus Satur-
day.

Bassett gave as the only reason
for discussing the robbery the pro-
tection of the University commu-
nity and the avoidance of further
such happenings.

The police reported that Billings
had notified them of the assault.

It was a by-law which directed the
executive council to select a re-
placement for resigned members
from those applicants otherwise
qualified who have the same cam-
pus political affiliations as the
resignee that was found to be un-
constitutional.

Wright to talk

Quincy Wright, professor of
political science, will speak next
Wednesday on “The UN: Propa-
ganda Weapon — Or the Means of
Achieving Peace?” The talk will
be given in East Lounge of Inter-
national House at 8 p.m.

Wright’s lecture will mark the
conclusion of the series “Your
Choice: War or Peace,” sponsored
by the International House educa-
tion committee.

examines the

the low level of his writing skill.

Just as romantic and more
striking characters are created
by Bowen. In her works, however,
characters are drawn — “almost
hypnotically”—toward their fates.

They are simple people who ask
for the simple things in life; and
they seek “the listless vacuum of
our times” in novels which are
“exquisite logs of disaster.”

A pattern which O’Faolain sees
in the writing of Evelyn Waugh
centers on a hero who has yielded
to an anti-hero. The hero is mar-
tyred, a scapegoat for our society.
Reality is denied, but in their de-
nial of reality, all Waughs char-
acters become “fundamentally
negative.” They never try to do;
they only try to avoid.

O’Faolain’s interpretation of
Joyce contained a direct appeal to
readers to recognize that Joyce is
a “propagandist of negations" and
then pass on. In Joyce’s Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man,
O’Faolain sees him as “So remote
from the world, so involved in an
imaginative reflection of the real
world, that he lived in the shell of
his ego.”

Win in track

Highlighting a winning
meet in track with Wilson
Junior and Elmhurst yester-
day, UC two-miler Walter
Deike set a new UC indoor
record of 18.6 seconds.

Deike's time was 9:19.7,
topping the 1950 record set
by Ken Mulcahy of 9:38.3.
UC's George McCormick
won the 1-mile in 4:43, the
880 yard run in 2:2.5 was
won by Hal Higdon, while
the 440 yard run went to UC
in :54.6 by George Damerow.

UC took the meet with
69%, to Wilson's 31% and
Elmhurst's 27. The relay
team came in ahead in
3:36.1. Walter Deike, who
is the captain of the Maroon
team, previously ran for the
University of Wisconsin. The
record which he broke was
tied in 1952 by Tom Scott.

Deike's time at the one-
mile mark was 4:42.

Total track team record
for the season stands at 11
wins and 1 loss.

clears agenda

At a final, general cleanup
meeting of the Student Govern-
ment for the winter quarter, held
last Tuesday in Law North, the
full, nine-point agenda was/cov-
ered.

The assembly adopted the Galy-
on-Stein election bill, introduced
by the elections and rules' com-
mittee, thus creating a uniform
law for use in future elections.
Major alterations effected by the
bill are the change in the due date
of petitions from Wednesday to
Tuesday of the third week in the
autumn quarter and the raising
of the maximum allotment of
money to be used in elections from
$125 to $150.

’Peter Green (ISL Bi.Sci) chair-
man of the academic freedom
committee, introduced the
Schwartz Bill, which suggests a
forum to be held on the topic of
academic freedom, and explains
procedure to be followed in select-
ing speakers for this program.
The bill was passed.

A committee of SG members
to work in executing the plan—if
possible, for Academic Freedom
Week, .was announced.

1455 East 55th St., Chicago

issues be referred to the student-faculty-administration court (SFA). The recommendations
were decided upon at the meeting of CORSO held last Tuesday.

The first of the two matters deals with the distribution of literature advertising the
Wash Prom. Originally the committee had intended to indict Student Union for distributing
the literature in places prohibited by the student code. It was discovered, however, that the

literature had been distributed
by the administration through
the Student Activities Office for
Student Union. CORSO then de-
cided to refer the matter to the
court to determine the legality of
such a move on the part of the
administration.

Claim rules illegal

The second question which the
committee is asking the court to
consider pertains to • the regula-
tions added to the student code
early this year. The focal point of
consideration in this matter is the
way in which the regulations were

added. According to the CORSO
committee, the rules were never
submitted to Student Government.
The Student Code specifies that

new regulations should

the administration.

No date has been set for the
hearing before the SFA court. It is
not known whether or not the
court will be able to fit the cases
on this quarter’s agenda or if it
will be decided at the beginning of
next quarter.

Constitutionality involved

According to Eli Stein, chair-
man of CORSO, the regulations
are not of weighty matter, but it
is the principle of constitutionality
that is involved. The crux of the
trouble is not the contents of the
regulations, .but the manner in
which they are added to the code,
he said.

division. Beginning in 1954, the master of arts degree will be
awarded to students who complete a program focused on
understanding the communication process and its effects on
opinions, attitudes, and behavior.

The program, designed for
students interested in public
relations, propaganda, or com-
munication research has been or-
ganized by the social science divi-
sion. Douglas t Waples, professor
of international communications,
is its chairman.

A four-year college graduate

*SS OF '54

by Warren Spachner

Apparently^raudulent subscription to Newsweek magazine have been illegally solicited in
Hitchcock Hall during the last two quarters.

According to Channing Lushbough, house head of Hitchcock Hall, a man named Harris,
allegedly representing an organization called the Associated Trade Press, has taken $33.50
in payment for these subscriptions from seven students. None of these students has ever
received any of the magazines subscribed for or any letter of acknowledgement of the

subscriptions. “Furthermore,
although I kicked him out of

some more subscriptions,” Lush-
bough said.

Lushbough concluded by saying
that there were two reasons for
thinking that these solicitations
were fraudulent.

None of the students wl^ sub-
scribed for magazines as a result
of Harris’ solicitations, even those
who subscribed last quarter, have
received any of their subscrip-
tions yet.

The other reason for thinking
that these subscriptions were
fraudulent was inconsistency in
the price ($4.50, $4.00, and $3.00)
asked for a one year subscription.

Eidsen, chief of the campus po-
lice, in commenting on this situa-
tion said, “A number of people,

whose credentials seemed to be .

much other information as you
in order tried to solicit subscrip-	*

tions to magazines in Burton-Jud-
son. But I had to stop them from
soliciting because they did not
have permission from the Univer-
sity administration to solicit. In
fact since it is against University
regulations for any representative
of any organization not a campus
organization officially recognized
by both the University administra-
tion and student government to
solicit for any reason on Univer-
sity property, I would suggest the
following: Should Harris or any
other individual not from an of-
ficially recognized campus organ-
ization solicit any of our students
while he or she are on campus;
for your own protection do not
under any conditions and no mat-
ter how attractive accept the offer.
Get, however, such illustrative
material as the agent may have
and bring this material plus as

can remember about the agent
(his name, his description, etc.) as
soon as possible to your house
head. Then contact immediately
the campus police and give them
this information.

Critic libelous

When the directors of Playwrights
Theatre Club chose T. S. Eliot s Murder
in the Cathedral for production, it was
because of the following considerations:

It is a play of striking theatrical
power and great beauty of language.

Its intellectual contest is presented
with a simplicity and integrity, and,
within its universe of discourse, with a
maximum of objectivity.

In a time when the examination of
any idea, theatrical or otherwise, is
open to public censure, Playwrights
Theatre Club has done as much as pos-
sible to buck the tide by presenting
plays of intellectual and emotional
honesty. Should we make it our policy,
within this category, to present only
plays with any one specific outlook, we
would be defeating our purpose, and
incidentally cutting off a great part of
the world’s finest dramatic literature.

It was with these thoughts and this
responsibility in mind that Eliot’s play
was chosen. As a digression, it is in-
teresting to note that no play we have
done has represented the unanimous
attitude of the group, not politically,
intellectually, spiritually, nor emotion-
ally.

Once Murder in the Cathedral was
chosen for production, it was given, for
the reasons stated above, as strong a
presentation as our creative energies

SG in vacuum?

I would like to ask the members of
the ISL to reconsider their action in vot-
ing for a bill which is “Incompatible
with a system of proportional repre-
sentation.’’ One of the reasons that
was given for this action was stated by
Marlon Smith (ISL); he stated, “PR in-
tends to encourage splinter groups to
run.’’ L think that this statement is
indicative of the type of thinking that
exists in the ISL.

I believe that, at the present time,
the Student Government exists in a
vacuum, away and aloof from the cam-
pus. Few students are concerned with
or are even aware of the SG. One of
the reasons for this apathy is the pres-
ent election system.

If SG is to be effective, it must be
representative. A PR system of election
would insure the campus of a more

representative SG. At present, it is al-
most a necessity to join one of the po-
litical parties to become a member of
the government. Many students do not
wish to join one of these parties, and
so, they lose interest in SG. If the elec-
tion rules were changed, the composi-
tion of the SG would change. At the
present time, due, I believe, to the par-
ticular philosophy of the ISL, our SG
has degenerated into a sort of social
club, composed of a group of pompous,
typical ward-heeler ^Jpes of the worst
variety.

Mr. Smith is opposed to fighting the
issues out on the floor of the assem-
bly. He must have good reason for fa-
voring the secret caucus type of dis-
cussion where the members of the gov-
ernment can discuss the merits of a
bill from the viewpoint of what is good
for their party politically rather than
what is good for the campus in gen-
eral.

If SG is ever to fulfill the function
for which it was established, its mem-
bership must be broadened. It must
cease to be composed of a self-perpetu-
ating group of picayune parliamentar-
ians, or it will finally just cease to
play the role that a real student gov-
ernment is intended to fulfill. So, I
urge you not to be afraid of splinter
groups; let others beside the members
of ISL enter SG, for If you don’t, you
will be defeating the idea of a student
government that will mean something
to the campus.

Defends “apathy"'

There was a great deal of talk about
“campus activities’’ and ‘‘student
apathy’’ in the Letters to the Editor
column of last week’s MAROON. The
author of the “Porfirio” letter (who de-
scribed himself as a “jovial fraternity
man” in another part of the MAROON)
labeled Mr. Littlejohn and me as mem-
bers of a “small, yet noisy group of
intellectual snobs” who oppose the ef-
forts of a wholesome rah-rah clan to
promote a “resurgence of campus ac-
tivities!” This reply, from a member
of the Cap and Gown staff, Is equiva-
lent to an admission that the widely
held view is correct — that this year’s

Annual will hardly appeal to the “vast
majority of students.” Apparently the
Cap and Gown staff has no desire to
solicit $4.25 from any of us “intellectual
snobs.’’ I presume alumni subscriptions
will make up the financial loss.

The jovial fraternity man’s letter re-
vealed, for all to see, that the goal of
the group for which he speaks is to
effect a resurgence of midwestern rah-
rah social life at the U of C—the kind
of “campus life” characterized by its
central concern with the three B’s:
Basketball, Blowouts, and Booze. Off-
hand I’d say that it’s better to be
“apathetic” than to join the efforts
of this motley group of self-appointed
B. M. O. C.’s.

The letter from An Alumnus, how-
ever, contained a modicum of good
sense. He was quite correct, I believe,
when he Implied that participation in
campus activities could result In a
certain amount of growth for a student.
But the big question remains: Which
student activities do the most to rein-
force—not contradict—the proper alms
.of education?

This campus offers innumerable stu-
dent activities more worthy of a wide
support than the Pep Club! For exam-
ple, instead of organizing cheering seer
tions and vying for social prestige, why
don’t the rah-rah fraternities—for seven
days—use their seemingly boundless
energy in a campus activity involving
thought? The second week of April has
been declared Academic Freedom Week
on every member campus by the Na-
tional Students Association; the pur-
pose of the project Is to promote
thought and discussion about the prob-
lems connected with free Inquiry which
confront teachers and students in to-
day’s universities. Each interested cam-
pus organization is invited to discuss
these problems at its meetings during
the week. To serve as starting points
for these discussions, tapes of congres-
sional hearings will be available, forum-
type discussions will be held, and a
nationally known speaker will be pre-
sented to the campus.

So far, the reaction from Internation-
al House and the dormitories has been
gratifying, and most of the residence
halls have sent delegates to the steer-
ing committees. On the other hand, no
response, whatever, has been forth-
coming from the fraternities, and it is
feared that our home-grown “Greeks”
will not be Interested at all. Yet the

CLEAHER,
FRESHER,
SMOOTHER I

rah-rah boys proudly display the Pep
Club as a student activity worthy
their leadership. They might have a
point there.

East-West trade needed to relieve tension

improve United States economic position

“While we talk about the question of East-West trade, the trade is going on,” said
De Witt Gilpin of the United Electrical Workers Union, at a meeting at International House
on Wednesday evening. “The world is integrated. You cannot cut out one-third of the
world’s population and say that you will have nothing to do with it.”

Gilpin asserted that we have to face reality. There is an economic recession. In order
for companies to continue making profits without decreasing the wages of the workers,
trade must be expanded.----------------------------------------------

Many companies, he said,
such as Chrysler and Inland
Steel are now presisng for trade
with China. Such businessmen;
Gilpin maintained, think that we
should forget about politics and
trade where we can. McCarthy, on
the other hand, represents the
point of view that the whole mat-
ter is political in nature and that
we should not strengthen these
countries economically or any
other way. Gilpin stated that he
would discuss East-West trade
with both views.

“I do not believe in war,” he
said. “I think that trade relations
will decrease international ten-
sions. I think we had better start
producing on our boasts that this
country is an arsenal of democ-
racy. Let’s use our technical

knowledge to obliterate rather people for parity. The stuff just

than to expand colonialism. I don’t
think we should try to dictate
India’s foreign policy before we
trade with them. If other nations
had done to us what we are doing
to one-half the world’s population,
perhaps even* all of the world’s
population but ourselves, we
would not have survived.”

Trade can be mutual

"The most important aspect of
trade is that it be mutual,” Gilpin
declared. “The Soviet Union is
now making us appear as a com-
petitor for the top position in the
British type of imperialism in the
countries of Asia and South
America.

"There is no sense in loading up
the nation’s granaries with sur-
plus products,” he continued.

"World trade is not the only
solution,” admited Gilpin, "but it
is a step in the right direction. It
will provide an approach to the
peoples of the Soviet Union, India,
Venezuela, . . . that will differ
from the approach of McCarthy
and the idea of trying to supplant
Britain as an imperialist nation.*

Gilpin remarked that he would
only make one prediction. “In the
event of fifteen million unem-
ployed, we will certainly have to
start trade with the East. For
then such pressure will be brought
upon McCarthy by business and
labor, that he will have to con-

Student Union exhibit lacks quality

The Student Union Art Exhibit for 1954, currently on display in the Reynolds north lounge,, ranks far
below any of its predecessors in quality and quantity of works.

The exhibit appears to have been dumped, not hung. This, together with the small number of works
represented, indicates that perhaps the exhibit was treated too lightly by its sponsors.

The 12 oil pointings en-
tered ore uniformly poor.
The artists apparently have
nothing to say, and are, there-
fore, experimenting in ‘*fure
form,” if such a thing is possible.
The judging appears to be accord-
ing to technical perfection, and if
this is the criterion, the selection
of the judges is correct. First prize
went to an abstract still life by
Jacqueline Hermann. The major
virtue of this work is a fairly com-
petent job of putting paint on
canvas.

It is rather surprising that
the judges (lid not observe the
striking similarity between Joli
Lasker’s second prize painting
and a prewar KCA Victor record
jacket for the Franck 1). Minor
Symphony. One might note that
for $5.95, a considerable reduc-
tion from Miss Lasker’s asking
price of $20.00, the same paint-
ing, with much better technique,
may be obtained along with an
excellent piece of music.

In the non-oil category, the ex-
hibit picks up some, but the abil-
ity of the judges descends. First
prize went to a “primitive,” Fish,

Barfok shines in closing concert

Last Friday, Feb. 26, the University Concerts closed their
Winter Quarter series in Mandel Hall with a concert by the
Vegh String Quartet, comprised of Sandor Vegh and Sandor
Zoldy, violins, Georges Janzer, viola, and Paul Szabo, ’cello.
The program consisted of the Brahms Quartet Op. 51 in C

minor, Bartok’s Quartet No.
Op. 127 in E-fiat major..

The program got off to a
rather slow start. The Brahms
is far from his best chamber work,
and is rather hard to listen to how-
ever played, but in this case would
have been greatly improved by
better intonation and, in general,
a calmer interpretation. The Bar-
tok was given an excellent rendi-
tion, with great spirit and preci-
sion, as it well deserves. It is a
fine work, and was the high point
of the program.

ing enough, but it was obscured
by a continual emphasis on detail
and the lack of any overall con-
ception.

a work of the standard repertoire,

will be devoted to bring more
contributors into the exhibit to
restore its all-campus character.

Bala Krishna, Indian artist,
gives authentic performance

Sri Bala Krishna, all-India radio artist currently on a world
tour, demonstrated in a concert last Saturday night at Inter-
national House that Indian music can be very exciting, even
to Western audiences unfamiliar with the idiom.

Bala Krishna is primarily a singer^ though he often plays
simple instrumental accompaniment to his songs. He was ac-

companied in this concert by
several Indian musicians living
in Chicago.

Indian music is very diverse
in form, using both simple
rhythm and polyrhythmic
forms, and a large number of
scales. The tonal diversity is
further -pointed to by the con-
struction of stringed instru-
ments with movable frets, used
in many tunings. There are
three basic classifications of In-
dian music, referred to as classi-
cal, popular and folk. The dis-
tinction is primarily one of
form, since all three types would
fit into a Western definition of
folk music. In classical songs,
the words are of little impor-
tance, and are often disconnect-
ed chants fitted to the music. In
the folk form, the lyrics are
descriptive, setting a scene or
a mood. The popular songs are
more specific in their descrip-
tion, approaching narration,
though the ballad per se is un-
known in Indian music.

Bala Krishna sang examples of
all three types, in an excellent
voice. The classical • songs were
perhaps less interesting to a non-
Indian listener. Some of the vocal
intonations and tonal patterns of
the folk and popular songs are

Gaurang Yodh, a student in
physical science, performed a
solo on the 17-stringed Sitar, the
most popular of Indian stringed
instruments. The technical in-
tricacy of the solo was amaz-
ing, and the style of play much
resembled a frantic banjo solo
by an American folk virtuoso.
The solo was one of the high
points of the concert, and was
very well received by the audi-
ence.

The instrumental trio, with
Yodh playing Sitar, I. R. Bhato-
dekar on tuned hand-drums and
Hasan Effendi, a Pakistani mu-
sician on campus playing reed
flute, fell flat because the instru-
ments were out of tune, a fact
which disconcerted the musicians
so much they were almost unable
to finish the piece. The difficulty
was perhaps due to the program-
ming, which did not allow time for
the musicians to go through the
lengthy procedure of tuning the
complex instruments.

Indian students present at the
concert considered the perform-
ance very authentic and reason-
ably competent.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

JV team

loses bid

for crown

Coach Joe Stamp’s JV
besketballers were defeated last
week by Harvard High for the
Private School League champion-
ship. 45-42. Chicago entered the
playoff series, which was held in
Bartlett Gym, holding first place
in the regular seasons competi-
tion.

The junior Maroons played a
fast, tight game against Harvard,
but their pace slowed slightly in
the second quartre, enabling Har-
vard to take a slight lead. The
JV Maroons lacked the bench
depth to replace their tired play-
ers. and when Dewey Jones
fouled out, the pressure on the
players was great enough so that
Harvard took the three-point lead
that eventually won the game.

Peviously the JV team had de-
feated Christian, 55-48. and
Wheaton, 38-29, to enter the final
contest with Harvard.

Mitch Watkins, the JV’s lead-
ing scorer, finished the year as
the second highest scorer in the
Private School league.

Ending a comparatively successful basketball season, the
Maroon cagers dropped a rough-and-tumble contest to^Con-
cordia College, 82-76, last Saturday. The score see-sawed until
center Wally Lonergan fouled out in the last quarter, and
Chicago was unable to pull itself together for the last burst
which would have meant victory.

contests

Maroon fencers were de-
feated in three contests within 24
hours last week.

On Saturday they dropped a
close match with the University
of Iowa. 14-13, and lost to Mich-
igan State, 18-9. The day before,
Ohio State defeated them, 17-10.

Once again the inability of the
Maroons to do well on two
weapons in the same meet re-
sulted in losses. Friday the epee
of Alex Shane. Joe Grassie and”
Ted Small made an excellent
showing, winning 7 out of 10. But
the sabre team won only one bout.

In direct contrast, the next day
the sabre team ran over Iowa, 7-2,
while the epee men were defeated,
6-3.

Shane was the outstanding
fencer Friday, winning his three
matches. Dave Bobrow won five
sabre matches. Sabre men, Dave
Karcher and Shane each won four
matches in the meet Saturday.

six events to down the Pier, 50-46
and swamped Notre Dame, 69-29.

Bob Herndon and Ron Graham

Winning all but two events, the Maroon trackmen defeated
Monmouth College, 82-22, in a dual meet at the Fieldhouse
last Saturday.

Meet records fell as the Maroons racked Monmouth. In all,
four new marks were set and t^o tied. Frank Loomos ran
the 70-yard low-hurdles in the record-breaking time of :08.1

and Joe Howard put the shot ~	;	’	—	"

- mile-relay team will be a quartet

42’ 9Vo’ f°r another record.
While Monmouth set a new
mark in the pole vault, the mile
relay team of Dave Shephard,
Phil Wyatt. Ken Stapley and
George McCormick dashed about
the track to stop the clock at
3:24.6.

Loomos tied the record for the
60-yard dash and Shephard jump-
ed 20’ 10^" to match the previous
mark.

By winning Saturday's meet,
the Maroons enter the North Cen-
tral Invitational tomorrow at
Naperville, Illinois, with a 11-1
record for the year.

UC slammed the shot-put, the
440-yard dash, the two-mile, and
the high jump. Captain Walt
Deike won the mile run while
Hal Higdon took the two-mile.
Wyatt ran the 440 in :52.9 to win
and Art Omahundra won his first
half-mile run in slightly over two
minutes. Bob Mason won the high
jump with a 5' 8" leap.

his mile relay team for the Daily

March 27. Either Stapley or Mc-

been called the “best low hurdler
in the Midwest” will be unable to
bring any trophy back to the

Yesterday, Chicago Intercollegi-
ate Championship matches began
at Bartlett Pool. The swimmers
take a respite today and will re-
sume their competition tomorrow
afternoon.

Concordia held a slight edge
through the first period. The
Maroons’ quick offense fa-
vored the set shooting of Dave
Smith and the driving of Bob
Mann, and Chicago kept pace so
that the quarter score was 24-21
in Concordia’s favor.

Lonergan, however, had col-
lected three personal in the first
period, and halfway through the
second stanza Fred Hubbard re-
placed him. Midway in the period
UC tied the score and kept a slim
lead until halftime. 47-44.

Concordia takes lead

The first few minutes of the
second half found the UCers pull-
ing ahead, but Concordia broke
fast several times to tie the score
and go ahead. Chicago caught up
again, and Concordia duplicated
its feat, to end the quarter with
a score of 65-63.

The game continued the same
way for a part of the last period,
until Lonergan had his fifth foul
called. Concordia controlled the
game after that and stalled away
the last few minutes to make the
final tally 82-76.

Notre Dame wrestlers threw the
