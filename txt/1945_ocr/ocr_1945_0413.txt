symbol to Americans and

to the world, the symbol of a man who met, and conquered, a
challenge. His death is similarly a challenge f a clarion call to
Americans of all political faiths and creeds to unite in the winning
of the war and in the achievement of the peace for which he
lived and died.

“These are times that try men's souls."

And these are times of tragic historical parallel. Abraham
Lincoln died in office and his work was shattered by the blind
bigotry and narrozv stupidity of grasping politicans. Woodrow
Wilson, an American of enduring greatness, suffered the same fate.
Shall we similarly be crucified by our petty politics, by our blind
obstructionists?

War is a challenge to youth.

Let us unite with the new president; let us rededicate our-
selves to the tasks remaining before us. Let us follow in the
footsteps of a great liberal and humanitarian for surely shall they
lead us to the new world of justice and liberty for which he and so
many million others have suffered and died.

Hutchins Issues Statement;
Quadrangles Are Lethargic

The startling and numbing
disclosure that President Roose-
velt is dead yesterday stunned
and electrified the 5,000 students
of the University, but there was
little outward demonstration or
comment.

The 32nd president of the United
States succumbed at 4:55 (Chicago
War Time) at Warm Springs, Ga., of
a cerebral hemorrhage. Mr. Roose-
velt, 63, had served the nation as
its chief executive for twelve years
and three months.

Harry S. Truman, Vice Presi-
dent, and former Missouri senator
was given the oath of office and
sworn in as the 33rd president at
6:09 p.m. (CWT).

President Hutchins in a brief, terse’
announcement echoed the sentiments
of the campus when he declared that
“the death of the President comes as

“Education should alter its methods

President Hutchins declared at the
first annual banquet of the University
Veterans’ Council, last Friday night
at the Windemere West Hotel. “Edu-
cation of veterans is like the education
of any one else, subject to the qual-
ification that the veterans have lost
time and will be under pressure.”

Tonight; ODP To Play
Driftwood’at Mandel

By BETTY STEARNS	|

The first performance of Maurice *T. Dunn’s “Driftwood” isl
expected to be greeted by a large audience tonight at 8:30 in
Mandel Hall as the Office of Dramatic Productions presents its first]
spring bill.

The play, written by a former
University of Chicago graduate,
has never before been given on
any stage. The author, an engi-
neer by profession, has written
plays before, but none which he
deemed worthy of production.
Jere C. Mickel, head of ODP, is
directing.

Mr. Dunn, using the University as
background, has let the heroine quit
her position in the Social Science
Department, and succumb to an urge
to return to nature. In the main,
“Driftwood” is concerned with her
life in the Indiana dunes, and her

relations with the scattered inhab-|
itants.

Playing the part of the escaping
professor is Martha McCain, graduate
student in the Theological school.
Miss McCain, who has acted in stock,
as well as on the radio, was seen

Author of Controversial Best

Seller Will Arrive April 20

A full schedule, with a lecture series and a radio appearance
has been arranged by the University for Friedrich A. Hayek’
author of the best-seller, “The Road to Serfdom,” following his
arrival on campus April 20.

The week on the Midway will be
only part of a nationwide tour by the
University of London economist,
whose book, a publication of the Uni-
versity Press, has been acclaimed by
critics as “one of the most important
books of our generation.” Hayek, a
native Austrian now a British citizen,
will discuss at the university some of
the arguments in his book, which
warns the free nations that they are
veering toward a collectivism which
is incompatible with democracy.

He will deliver free public lec-
tures in Mandel Hall at 4:30 p.m.,
April 24, 25, and 26 under the
general title, “The Money Stream
and the Flow of Goods.” Specific
titles on the respective days will

network.

Local Rule Seen
As Ideal Gov’t
By Carl Swisher

Local government is the ideal
forum for the practice of democ-
racy, and this fact should not
be forgotten as the federal gov-
ernment takes itself more and
more power, Carl Brent Swisher,
chairman of the political science
department of John Hopkins Uni-
versity, said Tuesday in a Wal-
green Foundation lecture.

“Tyrants are not merely relics of
antiquity,” Swisher asserted in the
second of his series on the growth of
constitutional x power in the United
States. “They are of the ranks of
men wherever power is given without
restraint. A major purpose of our
federal system is to divide power so
as to diminish the intoxication which
goes with it, so as to reduce the pros-
pect of tyranny when power is given,
as inevitably it must be. With the
tremendous increase in power now
flowing through government and cer-
tain to continue to flow, the need for
checks and for division becomes great-
er than ever before.

“Something vital to the good life
of a community is lost when people
abandon control to rulers at a dis-
tance, however wise and beneficent
the rulers may be,” he said.

Williams is currently Director of the
national Farmer’s Union. He was

both labor and farm groups but was

Northern Republican bloc. Williams
is the former head of the National
Youth Administration, scrapped two
years ago at the instigation of Sen.
Pat McKellar of Tennessee who led
the senate fight opposing William’s
ratification last month. Williams has
been branded by the Dies committee’

McKellar charged that he was unfit

President Hutchins suggested that
the suitable plan of action would be a
return to a program similar to the
Chicago Plan of 1930 which afforded
the student a wide range of academic
freedom. “The Chicago Plan of 1930
was built for the veteran who wants
an education.”

Even with the G-I Bill of Rights
he believed that many of the veterans
would not be willing to sacrifice the
time now required to get an education.
Therefore, he stated, it will be neces-

most tremendous program of adult

Editorial



The V-E Morning After

Newspaper and telephone wires crackled a
week ago and within a few hours a stray rumor
which had been magnified into a “Victory” giant
galloped across the nation. Pent-up peace ru-
imors spilled over the dam to innundate even the
□most cautious.

While the false alarm was largely the product
of wild-eyed, irresponsible persons, it neverthe-
less is a straw in the wind, indicating, of course,
that the war is rapidly approaching an end in
the European theatre of operations and bringing
with it the letdown, tumult, and problems of the
post-war era.

Only now, slowly but surely, is the real story
of the University’s contribution to the war being
made known. The whole story perhaps will never
be known. But as the curtain is drawn back one
cannot but be impressed, and even awed at mo-
ments, by the vast and momentous role which this
University has assumed in the war effort. In re-
cent weeks, University bigwigs have begun to
take stock of the war and its effects on the cam-
pus. The recent boost in tuition is a direct result
of that survey. Problems of expansion, of remod-
eling of the curricula, of the role of the veteran
are already under diagnoses.

The University has traveled far down the
trail since the bleak days of ’41 when it appeared
likely that collapse of American educational
institutions was imminent. That the govern-
ment was unmistaken in taking cognizance of
the important and significant contributions which
education might make to the war effort has been
driven home with brilliant and devastating force
in recent weeks.

Innuendoes

-----Friday, April 13, 1^45

by Armstrong

In taking stock, of the contribution which
this University has made to the war, one might
note the unending parade of army and navy
medical students, of army language training
units, of navy meteorology units which have
been trained here. The last vestiges of the once
large program—the Civil Affairs Training School
—is nearing completion of its agenda. Many
important wartime problems, including advanced

research on military problems, the results of
which may not be made public for years to come,
have been undertaken on the Quadrangles.

Hundreds of members of the faculty have
served the government in one capacity or an-
other. Thousands of alumnae and matriculating
students have laid aside their books.

But the problems are just beginning. The
morning after V-E and V days and the days to
follow those glorious celebrations will present
the real crises to American education. The prob-
lems of ’41 will perhaps seem petty in comparison
to the staggering question-marks which now con-
front university educators.

For three long years Washington has poured
millions of dollars into the University budget—
22 million of 31 million dollar budget a year ago.
Those financial burdens must now be assumed by
the University.

Professors and instructors who have distin-
guished themselves in the war many times over
are returning to their desks. They must be re-
integrated into the University program.

Returning veterans and servicemen pose an
acute problem of the first rank. The university
administration, through the president, has al-
ready expressed concern over the standards of
education and the fear tjiat these may be lowered
as a result of GI influx. While we cannot sym-
pathize nor agree with those who oppose state
subsidization of education, even when in a lim-
ited form, the fact remains that a problem of
orientating the veterans and of framing a cur-
ricula to fix their needs, faces the University.

Sermons are not in order. We have little if
any use for those officious busybodies who have
been handing down edicts from on high asking
that all V-E jubilation be subdued, that all pent-
up emotions be completely curbed. Let us by
all means have a safe and sane V-E day. Let it
be a joyous day of Thanksgiving. But above all
let it be a reminder that a tremendous job, both
in the completion of a great war, and in the
recovery from that war, remain to tax our in-
genuity and our strength and our wisdom.

To the Editor:

The boy and girl acrobatic groups which appeared in Look Magazine
were rather generously written about in your newspaper. This note is an
expression of the appreciation of this department, the group, and myself
to you and to your staff. Physical education is still in its infancy and a rather
misunderstood child because of having been raised by too many famous but
uneducated athletes. We can always welcome an understanding uncle.

Veteran Professor Says Illinois
De-EmphasizesLiberalEducation

The perennial battle between a “liberal or cultural” and a
“vocational or technical” education flared again on the nation’s

college front last week.

At the University of Illinois, Dr.
Ernest Bernbaum, a $6,500 Professor
of English and former head of the
English department, tendered his res-
ignation, asserting that a “cultural
education has been steadily losing
ground here to the techniques of
earning a living.” His particular
bone of contention was a $20 million
appropriation for a postwar athletic
stadium, funds which he said could
be “more fruitfully employed” in ad-
vancing a “liberal education.”

None of the Illinois directorate, in-
cluding the president of the Univer-
sity or the trustees would comment.
Neither would Bernbaum’s associate
professors. The students were apath-

Dear Mr. Editor:

This is an open letter to “Disap-
pointed Dan” of the Geisha Gazette,
University ASTP newspaper:

Your gripe about dungerees in the
ilast edition of The Chicago Maroon
’ certainly humiliates your taste in
women. Our lack of eye-appeal makes
us disappointing to you. If such is
your criterion for an attractive wo-
man may I recommend your purchas-
ing a ticket to any second-rate movie
or reviewing some of the past issues
of Esquire.

People like you, Dan, can’t appre-
ciate that the “dungy” on this cam-
pus is one of our important manifes-
tations of real democracy. It levels
the display of economic inequality
stressed by the glamour college. Here
the deb and the pleb plus the “dungy”
are one and indistinguishable. And
in our money society, that’s a pretty
important attribute for a paltry bit
of denim.

Your trouble, Dan, is gullibility.
The kitten-like fem with tomorrow’s
mode and make-up is not the gift of
generous nature. She is rather the
gratuity of tedious art. That “art is
long and time is fleeting.” Choosing,
arranging, and reorganizing ensem-
bles, worrying about what to wear
on Thursday, since everything pre-
sentable has already been worn on
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,
bores into one’s hours.

I don’t know what you’re here for,
Dan, but we’re here to improve our
minds and become better citizens.
And we’d rather spend our time pur-
suing that end than ironing that extra
frill or baking under permanent-wav-
ing apparatus.

I’ve gone to both kinds of schools,
and I’ve accepted the “dungy” fully
and with jubilation for reasons men-
tioned above. I further affirm, it’s
pistols at ten paces for anyone who
says I lack either propriety or woman-

liness.

Yours, disappointed
at your disappointment,

M.R.

Maroon Critic Lashed

To the Editor:

When I came to the University
last fall, I was pleased to find that
the MAROON had a music critic
whose work clearly showed him to
have sound and consistent standards,
a firm knowledge of his subject, and
considerable critical acumen. His re-
views pleased me, not because they
occasionally reiterated my own ideas,
but because they presented some-
thing worth knowing and thinking
about, something that was worth pon-
dering over. I believe that his opin-
ions were honest and original ones, not
the sort of thing that I somehow feel
to have read before.

Last quarter this critic was re-
placed, without any explanation to
your readers. Your new reviewer has
brought a painful letdown from his
high standards. One might not al-
ways have agreed with W.R.W.’s
opinions, but they were always sharp-

A firm believer in his code of physical education, Coach E. F.

gymnastic classes on the U. of C

The national sportlight was focused

on the program a week ago when
Look magazine contributed a three-
page pictorial review to the classes,

can be over-emphasized in an institu-
tion which has dedicated itself to the
building of a well rounded citizenry.
Of such an overemphasis I suspect
this University can not be said to be
guilty. Such recent malpractices as
playing injured men with the sole
idea of winning instead of contribut-
ing to the development of the whole
person, has made it difficult for physi-
cal instructors who wish to follow the
ethics of the profession to work,” he
observed in connection with his inter-
connecting physical education with
the social, physical, and biological sci-
ences in daily class lectures and ac-
tivities*

By Sam Golden

The main problem in an interview
with Joseph J. Schwab, Asst. Pro-
fessor of Biological Sciences in the
College and Examiner, is to find a
way of adequately translating his
highly expressive vocabulary into the
language permissible in a newspaper.

For Mr. Schwab, “Music, like the
other arts, consists in the proper

Second
of a
Series

ordering of a large num-
ber of diverse parts. The
act of appreciation is to
be found in the capacity,
on the part of human be-

ings, to apprehend and react in some
unknown way to this ordering. The
“parts” of a piece of music may be
thought of in many different ways.
There are the conventional parts of
melody, harmony, and rhythm; but al-
so the melodies may be arranged in
groups, or the harmonies in particular
progressions, or there may be key
changes, etc., each of which contributes
its share inn constituting the order
which is the musical whole. “Similar-
ly, emotions and ideas for which the
sounds and their arrangements are
signs (conventional or perhaps real)
also are comprised within the musical
whole.”

The listeners can then comprehend
the music when, consciously or un-
consciously, they are able to dis-
cover the form of the part relation-
ships. But, Schwab emphasizes, it is
the music itself, not the emotional
association (impressions) which it
induces, that is (musically) appreciat-
ed by the audience. The question of
why the form of a piece of music is
appreciated is, according to this line
of thinking, “a mystery which has
never been solved.” We now see a
definite conflict between Mr. Schwab
and Elder Olson, whose views ap-
peared in The Chicago Maroon of
three weeks ago. Olson goes so far
as to say that the artistic form of a
piece of music is in the sequence of
moods which it represents; Schwab
denies this by saying “the emotional
moods can only be considered ^as ob-
jects of imitation in a metaphorical,
not literal sense; for emotions are not
sounds, and music is.”

In his own personal taste, Schwab
prefers Mozart to Tschiakovsky, and
he claims that he can justify this pre-
ference in his mind on the basis of
the more perfect assimilation of the
parts to the whole in Mozart, “but
what constitutes ‘more perfect as-
similation’ is beyond my power to
formulate.” -

, The success of the newest of
the department’s ventures, the co-
. ed acrobatic class instigated by
Beyer in the fall quarter, has
proven that men and women de-
rive more, physiologically and
psychologically when working to-
gether, than is the case in many
separate classes. This group is,
however, only one of a dozen
sports classes designed by the
coaches to promote bodily relaxa-
tion and relieve tension.

An ever-growing interest in the
generalized basic phys. ed. survey
courses 101, 102, 103, designed to
cover a wide variety of sports in sea-
son, has stimulated, during the past
three quarters, participation in the
specialized instruction at the 200 level.
These surveys, arranged by Coaches
Paul Derr, Joe Stampf, and Beyer,
have been remarkably productive with
men in every department of the Uni-
versity, from first year students to
faculty all taking an active interest.
The co-educational class, an extra cur-
ricular activity, may become a regular-
ly offered course, if its leader, who
at present has a 2A draft classifica-
tion, remains on the faculty.

Coach Beyer, distinguished on
campus for his black bowler hat,
raises tropical fish, goes canoeing
on Lake Michigan, and is an ac-
complished pianist. A native Chi-
cagoan, he has been on the ath-
letic staff since 1939, when he re-
placed D. L. Hoffer, “the grand
old man of gymnastics” as fresh-
man co h. He received his B.A.
from the University in 1939, and
recently was awarded a Masters
in physical education from George
Williams College.

Saturdays, when the office is open
from 10:00 A.M. until 12:00 M.

“We are today in this condition-
playing a tedious game with dead
forms to keep up the illusion of a liv-
ing art.”

Twenty five years ago, in litera-
ture at least, there was scanty evi-
dence of “dead forms” being resus-
citated to do anything. On the con-
trary there was furious clamour for
expanded and looser art form, with
vers libre and the monologue interieur
being exploited to justify the most
perverse extremes ini formlessness,
and such phenomena as the Dadiasts
and Jean Cocteau cutting their capers
to the delight and sanction of all.
But today the tables are turned, and
the evidence admits Oswald a chas-
tising I-told-you-so.

There is increasingly visible on
every side an ominously significant
reaction in favor of rigid discipline,
strict adherence to form and pattern,
deliberate emphasis on structure and
design. The best example of this
about-face may be found in the
French poet Louis Aragon. In 1920,
as a leader of the Dadaist Movement,
he was calling himself the Glass
Syringe and enthusiastically co-en-
gineering the Down-With-Everything
campaign. Today, chastened and sub-
dued by twenty years of exhausting
sterility and the ravages of World
War II, he has emerged a sober mas-
terful verse-smith, consecrated to his
craft, and producer, in Le Creve-
Coeur, of a dozen of the most per-
fect and deftly wrought poems of
his generation. His metamorphosis
was inevitable. A man cannot exist
indefinitely on skepticism alone.
Sooner or later, if he can find no
better refuge, he will come to an ex-
cessive cultivation of form and crafts-
manship. If he has nothing to say,
at least he will say it artfully, ele-
gantly, superlatively. A common
enough situation, reflected plainly in
the immaculate syllabic pattern of
Mirianne Moore, in the similarly de-
signed poetry of Dylan Thomas, in
the flashy mannerisms of E. E. Cum-
mings.

But the most conspicuous example
of this tendency in English poetry
is to be seen in W. H. Aulen. By way
of testimony, we have from Random
House this week, in an attractively
sober and unpretentious format,
Mr. Auden’s own selection of all that
“he wishes to preserve of the poetry
he has written so far” (blurb).
It’s an impressive array, 225 poems
in all, ranging from the precocious
‘Doom is dark and deeper than any
sea dingle’ down to the dazzling Sea
and the Mirror. And despite the large-
ly ineffectual ascent into a quasi-
Eliotesque mysticism in For the Time
Being (Auden’s Christianity-via Kier-
kegaard is too would-be, too desper-
ately deliberate, to be convincing),
the salient feature of all these poems
remains their astonishing exhibition

of verse technique.

Miscellany

New Name?

Over at Green Hall last week there was a tea. At the tea
was a new instructor in Soc. who had formerly been a graduate
student here. While making small talk, he began asking the girls
how long they had lived there and remarked that when he had
been a fellow here, the residents were much older than at present.
During the conversation he asked, “What was it that students
called the place?” A shuddering silence fell over*the room as
slightly embarrassed students mentally recalled shades of Meno-
pause Manor. As they looked at each other in puzzlement, trying
to think of some bright innocuous chit chat, he cogitated deeply.
Suddenly, his face brightened—the girls hid their faces—and he
cried out, “Ah, yes, they called 5t Indian Summer Home!”

Personal

Psi Upsilon had a homecoming week—Ensigns Tom Bradle and Wally
Heffron, fresh from Harvard Communications School, are in town for a
week and Lieutenant Ted Friedeman, B-24 pilot, is here too. Psi U’s loss
is the Merchant Marine’s gain—John Sharp left Monday . • . June Abrams
is sporting a new fraternity from a middie . • . Anne Putnam’s engaged to
Ensign Peter B. Seamans (he’s now in Hawaii). Betty Frieling is leaving
for the WAC medical corps April 19. Arlene De Ano will be married June 9——
he’s a marine at Quantico. Peggy Mueller’s engaged too ... Carol and Ernie
FitzHugh had a big double wedding April 6.

Youthful Misdoings Dept.

Professor Anton J. Carlson is still chuckling over one of his youthful
pranks. One day he was eating with three law students—they all ordered
kidney stew. When the would-be barristers weren’t looking, he sprinkled
some salt on the edge of their plates; as soon as they finished, he gravely
inspected the plate and announced that the kidney stew couldn’t have been
very good since there was so much uric acid left. At last word, their
dinners were no longer with them.

Curricular Notes

For several days a small yellow notice on the Cobb bulletin board
kept attracting attention, guffaws, and signatures. We became interested
and read the notice before B & G took it down. It was a repeat performance
of last summer’s list of certain non-credit courses offered. Among the
subjects were Geonetics 208a (more or less rural genetics); Rural Sanitation
358; Stack Methods 101-2-3-4 (or how to spend one’s leisure time in the
library); Draft Dodging B (for men only); and a fascinating course, Statis-
tics 503. The latter was particularly enlightening—its subject matter was
the statistical distribution of young female cadavers in the City of Chicago.

Respectful of our Reputation?

In a class the other day, Professor Charles Merriam paused in the
middle of his lecture, looked about, and fearfully asked, “Is there anyone
here from the Maroon? No? Fine, then I’ll proceed with the discussion.”
We don’t know quite how to take that . . .

Trivia

President Hutchins’s lawn will probably grow greener this year—a
couple nights ago a slightly happy group traipsed by the Great Man’s house
and dumped a large quantity of beer upon the grass. We hope the U. S.
Department of Agriculture’s experimental division will not experiment
with the new variety of fertilizer ... Foster Hall females were sleepless
Tuesday morning—a large cannon was pointing at the dorm (the pranksters
who brought it over decorated the piece of artillery with red flags and a flare).
In view of our recent writing of the missiles being tossed down, some moral
soul has posted in front of the dorms the signs which B & G leaves around
on the grass, “PLEASE.”

Sidelights on Footlights

“Swing Out Sweet Land” is not a bad show, it is merely
uninteresting. Whether or not the Theatre Guild was trying to cash
in on its own “Oklahoma!” I do not know, but at any rate they
have not succeeded.

The musical is apparently trying to
present a view of American folk mu-
sic from Revolutionary times to the
present, by a series of loosely con-
structed scenes. The 13 scenes, rang-
ing all the way from a New England
town to a speakeasy night club, are
held together by the presence of a
strolling minstral. This winning gen-
tleman seeks to establish the thesis
that the world is happier when it is
singing. Now this is all very well,
but somewhere along the line “Swing
Out Sweet Land” misses the mark.
Listening to old songs can be en-
trancing, as Burl Ives proved, but
when the singer has no musical qual-
ity in his voice, and furthermore does
not tap the warmth which lies in this

folk music, then calisthenics are a
disappointment.

. Burl Ives with his wonderful,
dry manner was the chief re-
deeming feature of the evening.
A group of Negro singers on
stage too little of the time, lent
the afore mentioned warmth,
which is so essential to any like
musical form. The dances, ar-
ranged by Doris Humphrey, were,
when they could be distinguished,
excellent.

You won’t make a mistake by going
to see “Swing Out Sweet Land”, es-
pecially if you get in on the second
act. With a better male lead, and
possibly more powerful directing it
could be completely enjoyable instead
of intermittantly so.

A Fairy Tale: Installment IV

We think that the game last
Saturday calls for this fourth
installment of what is rapidly
becoming a steady feature on
this page. The Illinois Tech
debacle, and that’s about the only
thing we could say in print, was
bad, admittedly, but the Univer-
sity has turned in some bad per-
formances before. So What?

Chicago has 11 more games ahead
of them. Their first game is behind
them now and our only hope is in
forgetting that one. When we say
we, that means the team and the
spectators too. For some reason,
nearly everyone we’ve talked to is
reconciled to the fact that this Uni-
versity is done as far as athletics
go. This is not the case, at least
in our estimation. Chicago can be
just as good if not better than any
other school in the midwest. If
all the wiseacres in the stands, the
boys who were having such a good
time laughing at what was going on
out on the field, went out for some
of the athletics that are open,
things might not be so bad. At
least they could stop shooting off
their mouths or stop being satified
at what they have done in other
sports. Enough of that.

The boys from Hevanston are com-
ing here tonight. They have a strong
baseball team probably stronger than
Chicago’s, but with a little luck, the
Maroons can win. Tomorrow, Chicago
goes up to Northwestern. On those
two games, the rest of the season
will probably hang, because two more
pastings like the Tech game plus the
prevalent attitude on the campus
would be enough to lick the St. Louis
Cards. There should be a lot of fing-
ers crossed both tonight and tomorrow
for two more- beatings may undo all
the work which has been done towards
getting the University of Chicago into
active Big Ten competition.

Baseball and
Track Start

The college track team opened its
outdoor season yesterday afternoon in
a meet with Concordia High on Stagg
Field. For Monday afternoon, an-
other meet is scheduled for the thin
clads of the cinders, this time with
Leo High, also on Stagg Field. The
times for these meets are not too
good as the track is still not in its
best shape, nor are the boys.

Nevertheless, a good season appears to
be in store for this team, built around
a strong nucleus of indoor men and a
large turnout of new material.

Behind the Field House, the knicker-
bocker boys are keeping the field
warm with practices and games.
There’s a good turnout for the dia-
mond cutters, which has been some-
what cut by Coach Stampf’s dropping
of the less essential players. The
team is scheduled for a game with a
strong Latin High squad this after-
noon at 4:00 on the Fieldhouse prac-
tice field.

Chicago Girls Win
Meet from Mundelein

Last Saturday the Basketball Play-
Day for girls underwent a sudden
revision in plans when four of the
five competing schools failed to show
up. However, Mundelein College came
with four teams each representing
one year of the college. In the morn-
ing Chicago and Mundelein tied, each
winning two games. Foster beat the
Mundelein Juniors, the 11th and 12th
Grades beat Mundelein Sophomores,
but W.A.A. lost to the Mundelein Sen-
iors and the Quads were defeated by
the Freshmen.

At the end of the afternoon section
Chicago was one game ahead, how-
ever. Foster won again, beating the
Freshman team, and W.A.A. lost to
the Sophomores, but the Quads staged
a comeback and beat the Senior Mun-
delein team giving a narrow victory to
Chicago.

Chicago To Play Northwestern
Here Today; Then Evanston

After starting their season in
a not too aspicious manner
against Illinois Tech, Coach Kyle
Anderson’s Maroon ball club
faces a two game series with
Northwestern this weekend.
The Evanston team, led by two
returning regulars, will play on
the Greenwood field at 4:00 to-
night and Chicago will return the
compliment at Evanston tomor-
row at 2:30.

By booting the ball too many
times and not being able to hit,
Chicago was helpless against Tech
as the Techawks ran away with
last Saturday’s game, 18 to 2.
Coach Anderson used three pitchers,
Bill Knapp, Lefty Hauck and Dick
Stoughton, pitching in that order
with Hauck coming off the best of
the three as far as earned runs go.
Tech went into an early lead in the
first inning and what looked to be a
rally was stopped off for Chicago
when Thomasma was called out at
second base on a very close play.
The Maroons were never able to ser-
iously threaten after the first inning
although three men were called out at
home plate in later innings.

Anderson has expressed the be-
lief that today’s game will be a much
closer affair as many of the Chi-
cago players who fared so badly
will have lost their first game jit-
ters. Batting has been stressed in
practice during the week while the
fielding, especially in the infield has
also been a focal point.

Still stinging from their first game
many of the players have also been
heard to remark that “the next one
will be different”.' Any complacency
on the part of team members has
been erased and Chicago should field
a much better team tonight. No ad-
mission will be charged.

11 Basketball
Awards Given

Coach J. Kyle Anderson, Universi-
ty athletic director has announced
the awarding of five major “C’s”,
five old English mionr “C’s” and one
plain garment award. Playing on one
of the most successful basketball
teams in recent Chicago history, for-
wards Fred DeGraw and John Kuhn,
center George Raby and guards Jo-
nathan Sharp and Howard Brokken
received major letters. Lark Flana-
gan, Ken Sears, John Adams, Law-
rence Breuklander and Hubert Dahms
were awarded old English letters for
their work while the eleventh man
on the squad, Floyd Erickson re-
ceived a plain garment. Falnagan
and Sears left the team about mid-
season for the services while Brok-
ken, Kuhn, Adams, Dahms, Breuk-
lander and Erickson were members
of service in training on the quadran-

A meeting for intramural soft-
ball in the university is set to take
place this Tuesday noon in Bartlett
Gymnasium’s Trophy Room. The
season is slated to open up full guns
near the middle of this month, de-
pending mainly on the weather.

Fads and fancies in college costumes are by
no means modern phenomena. Here is a
gay undergraduate of the Class of 1850.
Observe his flowing collar and tie, his super
expanse of Panama brim, and his studied
air of nonchalance.

This was in 1850, when America was
basking in peace. The Golden West was
opening up, and Express Service was keep-
ing pace. Today, there are few fads and fan-
cies on the college campus. They have given
place to the uniformity and efficiencies of
war time. Thousands of students are con-
centrated on the needs of the nation in arms.

Railway Express is devoting its nation-
wide services, both rail and air, primarily
to speeding war materiel. To help all con-
cerned, you can do three simple things with
your 1945 home packages and baggage:
Pack securely — address clearly and ade-
quately — avoid abbreviating state names.

Opening Meet April 21 With
North Central at Naperville

By MARSHALL LOWENSTEIN

Working with a fair fifteen
man squad on the outdoor cin-
ders, thinclad Coach Ned Merri-
am has announced a tentative
five meet schedule for the com-
ing season.

Working with a nucleus of hold-
overs from the indoor season, Mer-

riam can count on the services of
Jim Rust, Earl Dinklelocker, John
Bokman, track captain, Paul Russell,
Wallace Turtelotte and Al Sjoerds-
ma. Added to these men, all ready
for immediate service, are Howard
Bell, Don MacBride, Ed Vedyean,
Bob Voas, Warren Lane, Dave Wal-
ston, Larry Fischer and Winslow
Fox. Merriam may be able to draw
on several of the service men now
on campus who have had previous
experience in other universities of
the United States.

Jim Rust will repeat in the quarter

mile, while Earl Dinklelocker and Wal-
lace Turtelotte will represent the
Maroons in the dashes and broad
jump. Al Sjoerdsma, well built former
gymnast, is working on an increase
in the pole vault and also taking a
crack at the weight division. Bell,
off and on worker during the indoor
season, plans on competing in the
880 along with veteran John Bokman
who placed in the A.A.U. meet here
a few weeks ago. Ed Vedyean will
probablyl confine his efforts to the
shot put and possibly the discus.

ly defined, and one always knew where
he stood and why. Your new writer
offers only vague opinions; or worse,
as in his latest review, almost no
opinion at all. As a musical acquaint-
ance said, in reference to this review,
“I would prefer a review with mis-
taken values to one which says noth-
ing.”

As mere reporting the review of
the Schnabel recital fails to inform
the reader that more than one work
was included on the program. There
was virtually no concrete informa-
tion about the music or how it was
played: there was certainly nothing
to aid the reader in understanding
what was profound music—and sel-
dom performed music, at that. And
the earlier review of the Schneider-
Kirkpatrick recital fails even to men-
tion the name of the encore; there
must have been several hundred peo-
ple in the audience that night who
would like to know its identity. It
would seem that your present critic
not only is incapable of writing a
meaty and informative criticism, but
also cannot bother himself with re-
porting the simple facts.

In addition, I, for one, miss W.R.W.’s
excellent record reviews. There are
a large number of campus record
collectors, many of whom looked to
these reviews for guidance. We were
often able to obtain advice and in-
formation from them which was not
to be had even from the record maga-
zines.

You had a top-notch music critic
and you let him go. I don’t know
precisely why he is no longer on your
staff, but I am certain that you made
a graver error in replacing him.

Sincerely, J. F.
