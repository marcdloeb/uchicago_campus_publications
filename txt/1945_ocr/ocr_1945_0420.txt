Benefit Recital Here Today
One of Season's Highlights

This Tuesday, April 24th, a special, non-subscription recital
will be given in Mandel Hall by Webster Aitken, brilliant Ameri-
can pianist. The concert, which due to the generosity of Aitken
will be a benefit for the Composer’s Concert Series, will include
the following: Andante con Variazioni, by Haydn; Sonata in B
Minor, by Chopin; Piano Variations, by Copland; and Le Tam-

beau de Couperin, by Ravel.

Aitken was the pupil of Emil Sauer
in Vienna before studying for sev-
eral years with Artur Schnabel, whom
Mr. Aitken considers his musical
guide and mentor. A highly success-
ful six-year concert tour of Europe,

I-F Benefit Dance
Scheduled Tonight

Combining a World Student
Service Fund program with their
first all-campus social event of the
Spring quarter, the Inter-Frater-
nity Council will be hosts to the
student body tomorrow evening at
their Benefit Dance to be held at
In House.

Tickets, at $1.50 per couple, are
available from any fraternity man
or may be purchased at the door.

Three major constitutional revisions, designed to meet current
needs of fraternities at the University and to cope with postwar
expansion problems, yesterday were placed under study by an
advisory committee to the Interfraternity Council.

Jim Halvorsen, Psi Upsilon, who Wednesday was named Pres-
ident of I-F, replacing Jack Welch, asserted that continued growth
of the University, together with the impact of the college plan, has
necessitated overhauling of the fraternity structure.

“Fraternities have a place on the Chicago campus, and we are
planning a full and complete program,” Halvorsen told the I-F
Council, which coordinates all fraternity activity on campus.

The three-point program under consideration includes:

1,	Election of I-F officers by a Council consisting of two
members of each active fraternity.

2.	Compulsory compliance by all fraternities to any action
voted upon and approved by the Council.

3.	Elimination of the clause allowing representation on the
Council only to fraternities operating houses on the Quadrangles.

“Modernization of an outdated constitution is necessary,”
Halvorsen pointed out. The current I-F program is carried out
under a charter issued in 1937. The amendments, if sanctioned by

the council, will constitute the first
alterations to the constitution in eight
years.

Halvorsen disclosed that 6 of the 14
fraternities which existed in the
campus in 1941 are still active. Eight
have suspended for the duration. He
estimated that HO members are now
listed on active fraternity rosters and

Push V-E Day Program Here

Details of two V-E day services, both based on a theme of
“Thanksgiving and re-dedication to the task ahead” have been
outlined here.

1600 Students

The council of Hyde Park and Ken-
wood Churches and Synagogues will
sponsor an all-community service at
7:30 the evening of V-E day at Rocke-
feller Chapel. Earlier in the day of
victory, from 10:30 to 12 noon, all
classes in the college will be dismissed
for an all-student ceremony at the
Chapel.

A student committee has drafted
plans for the student service. Presi-
dent Hutchins has consented to speak,
but the program will be entirely under
the supervision of University students.

If V-E day occurs after 12 noon,
the ceremony will be held the follow-
ing day.

Charting details is a 5-man student
committee including Jean Gatewood,
Lois Boreger, Ed Wood, Nat Eek, and
Abe Krash, editor of The Chicago
Maroon.

The evening service will begin at
7:30 if word of victory over Germany
is flashed from General Eisenhower’s
headquarters before 4:30. If, how-
ever, the proclamation is released in
the evening, Chicago time, the com-
munity rites will not be conducted
until the following day.

The community service is under the

that 50 others are members of tem-
porarily defunct organizations.

constitution the executive committee
of the I-F council consists of five

Field Urges
Free Press
bi New Book

Freedom Is More Than a Word,
the first major work by Marshall
Field, publisher of the Chicago Sun
and a promoter of PM, New York
newspaper, was published Monday by
the University Press. Advance orders
indicate that the book may become a
best-seller.

The most essential aspect of democ-
racy, Field holds is “freedom of
access to facts.” On this ground he
urges the amendment of the rules of
the Associated Press, world’s largest
newsgathering agency, to permit ad-
mission of such newcomers as the
Sun, extension of the use of public
opinion polls, establishment of safe-
guards against possible control of
radio channels by “vested interests”
and extension of college education to
“all who can take reasonable ad-
vantage of it”

A large portion of the book is de-
voted to the history and purposes of
PM and the Chicago Sun, both of
which were founded, he asserts, with
the primary objective of fighting an
enemy that “is always the same.”
“We call him Facism or authori-
tarian. Today he wears a German
or a Japanese uniform; tomorrow he
may be an industrialist or a labor
leader or a newspaper publisher. In
essence, he is a state of mind, an
attitude which hates, scorns, and re-

masters in their own house.”

Colleges Should Train
For Specific Duties
Public Believes

An overwhelming majority of the American people—86 pei
cent—disagree sharply with the liberal education concept of the
University of Chicago, and believe that training for a specific
profession or occupation is the most vital function of a University
program.

That was the most poignant fact in a nationwide survey
conducted by Fortune magazine in collaboration with the Yale
University Committee on Postwar Problems.

The survey brought to light that 53.6 per cent believe training for a
specific occupation to be the most important duty of Universities while 33 per
cent regarded it as “very important” Ten per cent of those polled bracketed
vocational training as “not important.” Fortune editors noted that 60 per
cent in similar surveys has indicated a heavy majority.

Only 17.7 per cent of those polled agreed with President Robert Hutchins
that an education should train more useful citizens, the 67 per cent said
such training was highly desirable.

Breakdown of the 5th question asked in the survey follows:

Which of the following list of aims would list most important, very

important, not so important, for college education:			1 and 2	NOT  Important
	MOST Important	VERY Important		
Training for specific occupation	53.6	33.0	86.6	10.0
Ability to get along with people	33.5	54.2	87.7	9.1
Desire, ability to be more useful citizen	17.7	67.9	85.6	11.3
Ability to think logically	13.8	68.0	81.8	12.1
Moral growth	10.0	64.8	74.8	17.6
Advantage of being recognized as college man	2.8	31.4	34.2	60.9
More factual information	2.2	41.1	43.3	45.4
Better appreciation of culture	1.9	44.1	46.0	47.7

The survey further brought to light that the general public believes that
benefactors should virtually never be permitted to influence the teaching of a
subject or profession. 74.6 per cent rejected benefactors. 64.4 per cent said
the government should never interfere, 56.3 per cent opposed alumni influence,
51 per cent said the curricula should not be juggled by professors, and 45.6
per cent said trustees should not be permitted to influence teaching of a course.

Breakdown on other important questions in the survey follows:

Question 3—Do you think there are many or only a few young people
who are capable of going through college, but cannot afford to?

Many... .66.5	College graduates only:	Many... .50.9

Few......26.9	Few......44.0

Question 4—Do you think the following should contribute money to
colleges to remedy the situation?

	FEDERAL	STATE	PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
Yes	64.8	69.2	80.8
No	24.7	18.9	8.9

Of college graduates only 43.1 opposed federal aid, 40.2 favored it.

should in these departments:

Rembrandt Hailed As
"Greatest Master'

In a public lecture held last Fri-
day afternoon under the auspices of
the Department of Art, Dr. Otto
Benesch declared Rembrandt to be
the greatest master of modern times,
the man who created the pattern of
desire for spontaneity of drawing
which later appeared in the works of
Watteau, in those of Delacroix, and
developed then into the full-fledged
Romanticism of the nineteenth
century.

Dr. Benesch, now Fellow in Paint-
ing and Drawing at the Fogg Museum
of Art, Harvard University, is a
product of the School on Art History
conducted in Vienna by Max Dvorak.
Dr. Benesch’s book and articles on the
subject of Rembrandt form the most
comprehensive treatment of that art-
ist yet prepared.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Race Relations Conference Plans Completed

The two day anti-discrimi-
nation conference, scheduled here
next Saturday and Sunday and
featuripg some of the most
prominent liberals in the mid-
west, will seek to formulate a
program for action at the conclu-
sion of its discussions.

Aubrey williams, former director of
the National Youth Administration,
will be the keynote speaker, next
Saturday evening at 8 p.m. at Man-
del Hall, according to Labor Rights
and the United States student assem-
bly sponsors of the program.

All meetings of the conference will
be open to the general public. Follow-
ing Williams address, a panel to dis-
cuss principle objectives of the con-
ference is scheduled. Dancing will
follow.

The following afternoon three
panels have been scheduled at the
First Unitarian Church. Topics of

the discussions, to
known progressives
focus attention on
“Housing for All,”

be led by well
in the city, will
‘‘Jobs for All,”
and “Action for

All.” Elmer Henderson, regional
director of the Fair Employment
Practices Commission wlil chairman
the panel of job discrimination; Rev.
Paul K. Folini, of the United Church
of South Chicago, wil direct the
housing discussion.

Definite proposals for action by the
press, school, church, and the indivi-
dual will then be aired. James Wes-
chler, political ediotor of PM will
summarise the two-day findings.

According to Robert Sorenson,
president of the Sociology club, and
James Blout of Labor Rights, the en-
tire program has been completed and
the program approved by administra-
tion authorities.

appear on the University of Chi-

The first of the lectures, concerned
with “The Futility of a Purely Mone-
tary Approach to the Saving Invest-
ment Problem” will be given on Tues-
day. “How Much do we Want?” and
“Maximum Employment and Stable
Employment” will follow on Wednes-
day and Thursday. All three lectures
will be held in Leon Mandel Hall at
4:30 p.m. Admission is free.

Appearing on the Round Table
broadcast with Hayek will be Charles
E. Merriam, Professor Emeritus of
Political Science and Maynard Krue-
gar, Professor of Economics here. Sub-
ject of the discussion is The Road
to Serfdom, which warns the free
nations that they are veering toward
a collectivism incompatible with de-
mocracy; and that social planning, as
interpreted today, may, eventually
cause the end of all individual free-
dom, political as well as economic.

This book which was published by
the University of Chicago Press in
September, 1943, has just gone into
its seventh printing, and has been
called “One of the most important
books of our generation.’

Born in Vienna in 1899, Hayek re-
ceived his education at the Univer-
sity of Vienna. He was a Lecturer in
Economics there and directed the

Dorm Roundup

Burton ‘Gay 90’ Frolics, Girls’
Formal Mark Dormitory Slate

Two big social events headline this weekend’s events in the
dorms. Tonight Burton Lounge will acquire 1890 atmostphere
for the “Gay 90’s Dance.” Oldtime movies including Charlie
Chaplin and Mack Sennett comedies and thrillers, will be shown.
Dancing will be to records, and refreshments will be served.
A large crowd of pinstriped Burton and bebustled dates is ex-
pected to take part in the festivities.

Tomorrow night the Ida Noyes
Lounge will be the scene of the
Foster-Kelly spring formal. Seventy-
five couples are expected to dance to
the music of Mickey Brennan and his
orchestra.

♦ ♦ ♦

There are now two newspapers in
the dorms, each attempting to help
its house in its own way. The older
of the two, “Talk a Little Foster,”
was set up two months ago to combat
the lack of spirit in Foster Hall. The
new addition, “The 500 Entry,” states
in its lead editorial that the aim is
to improve the dorm program by
creating interest among the residents.
According to the publicty board of
the first two years, the founding of
these two newspapers gives evidence
that the residents of the dorms are
waking up to the possibilities of the
program of which they are a part.

In response to the rising demands
from both men and women’s dorms,
Dean Lawrence Kimpton, spoke last
Tuesday at Foster Hall on the Dormi-
tory program. After outlining the
purposes of the program, as set up
by the University, Kimpton answered
questions and criticisms from men
and women present. Members of the
dorms uestioned after the discus-
sion, agreed that more informal
meetings of that kind would be help-
ful in improving the dorm program
and relations between the residents
and the men who administrate the
dorm programs for them.

Mayer Issues
Statement On
Death of FDR

The death of President Roosevelt
wil not affect the outcome of the war,
according to Milton Mayer, in a state-
ment released this week to The Chi-
cago Maroon.

Mayer’s statement in part follows:

“I do not see how the death of
Mr. Roosevelt can effect the conduct
of the war. I suppose military ma-
chines, like all other machines, run
pretty much by them selves when, the
grand strategies having been laid out,
they are set in motion. No upset in
the grand strategies seems likely now.
The war is al over but the shooting.

“As for the character of the peace,
that, too, seems to me to have been
shaped firmly during the past three
years, beginning with Darlan and Dar-

lanism.
willing
ination
Stalin’s

Roosevelt was unable or un-
to defy Churchill’s determ-
to “keep what we have” or
determination to swallow

central-eastern and southern Europe.
Truman endorses Roosevelt’s policy
of unconditional surrender and a
peace of vengeance; a policy which
was also acceptable to Churchill and
Stalin.

“As for the effect of Mr. Roose-
velt’s death on domestic affairs, the
accession of Truman should be
measured against the might-have-
been accession of Wallace. Truman
is a symbol of “normalcy.” If Gov-
ernor Bricker is “an honest Harding,”
Truman is an honest, liberal Harding.
But he is still a Harding. Wallace is
the single, consequental remaining
symbol of New Dealism. With the
country going Right very rapidly, it
may be that an honest, liberal Hard-
ing will stave off violent conflict and
disaster a little longer than an irre-
consilable New Dealer could have
done.

“It may be, too, untimely as Mr.
Roosevelt’s death is, that its very un-
timeliness wil be salutary in depriv-
ing American liberalism of what was
rapidly becoming a father figure, and
in compeling American liberals to
face the genuine weakness of their
position against the resurgence of re-
action, a resurgance which Roosevelt
recognized in his recent appointments
and utterances.”

eludes two representatives from each

would call for the election of officers
by the entire 12-man council and
would slash the committee from 5 to

ministration streamlining would in-
crease the council’s effectivenes.

Requiring all fraternities to

out that measures proposed will
be sent to each fraternity for
consideration and will then be
acted upon by the council.

Indirectly, according to well in-

assist Negro fraternities who have
never been admitted into I-F, since
they have never been able to obtain a

Editorial

Are We Academic Automatons?...

Throughout the civilized world a week ago,
in humble chapels and in magnificant cathedrals,
the bells tolled their requiem and the high and
the low in life paused and wept in tribute to the
passing of a great leader. Universities in Amer-
ica, almost without exception, conducted approp-
riate rituals and exercises as the administrations,
the faculties, and the student bodies joined to
mourn and to honor.

But the reaction at this University—one of
the great institutions of the world—presents a
strange and most remarkable contrast. Not only
did we proudly display the “business as usual”
shingle, but the administration, the faculty, and
the student body, as if at a prearranged signal,
simultaneously collapsed into a state of apathy
and inertia. Here there were no services. There
was no pause. We did not honor.

On the contrary, the machinery of this Uni-
versity, such as it is, literally fell apart. The
President of the University was not available
at his home for press comment at 9 p.m., when
the editors of The Chicago Maroon were told
that “the president had (sic) retired.” Sub-
sequently a 23-word declaration was released by
the Office of Press Relations. Every other Uni-
versity president in America had come before
his students and his faculty.

None of the deans with whom responsibility
is logically vested acted promptly and with de-
cisiveness. The administration floundered in a
morass of indecision.

The religious groups on campus were befogged
and befuddled. Though lamps glowed in every
church and synagogue in the land, Rockefeller
Chapel was blacked out. . . . The Dean of the

Universities Throughout Nation

Conduct Services Honoring FDR

American Universities are virtually unanimous in spon-
taneously observing the death of President Roosevelt last week.

Typical rites were those at Ohio
State where President Bevis ad-
dressed the student body after sus-
pension of classes and closing of Uni-
versity offices. At Minnesota memo-
rial rites were held Sunday afternoon
with military units attending and
faculty members, in traditional robes,
participating in the service.

Purdue conducted services Satur-
day. Duke cancelled all student
events.

Other news from major Univer-
sities:

♦ ♦ ♦

One of the country’s earliest extras
announcing the tragic news of Presi-
dent Roosevelt’s death was published
by the Daily Kansan, student paper
at Kansas University. First copies
of the edition hit the streets at 6
p. m., only one hour and five minutes
after the news was received.

* * *

Brooklyn College is taking a leaf
from Chicago’s book in announcing a
new course “dealing with the broad
economic, social, political, and cul-
tural aspects of the development and
present functioning of our society.”
Ironic note is the fact that the insti-
tution organizing this survey is cur-
rently headed by Harry Gideonse, a
former Chicago professor, who during
his stay here was one of President
Hutchins’ most bitter opponents.

* * *

Ohio State’s Council of Frater-
nity Presidents has rejected a
recommendation to abolish haz-
ing as a part of fraternity ritual.
At the same meeting, the council
also rejected a proposal to estab-

chapel was speaking over a municipal radio sta-
tion.

In the midst of a war, only five hours after
the death of the Commander in Chief, a baseball
rally was scheduled—and held. On the day of the
President’s funeral, when men fell to their knees
to thank God that such a man had lived to guide
the nation through its most troubled years, the
University of Chicago proudly presented a three-
act “world premiere.” . . . The show must go on.

It is indeed a sad and most tragic commentary.
To denounce every individual on campus would
be useless, for no one can truly be charged with
the gross neglect that prevailed. Of recent
weeks, the lack of a student government has been
a popular whipping boy for all failures. And to
our way of thinking no more elequent demon-
stration of the need for some form of coordinat-
ing council could be found.

If this is the result of a liberal education, if
this is the end of training men and women to
act as rational beings, then our educational sys-
tem is a tragic failure. If the result of a free
education is only to foster and to develop inde-
cision, to destroy every last shred of sensibility,
to render us no more than robots and automatons,
then our scheme of learning has been ill-con-
ceived and mismanaged.

This has been the proudest boast of a liberal
education—that it freed men from their intellec-
tual shackles, that it was new, fresh, and original.
But if it has only blunted our minds as this
case so numbingly indicates, there is something
radically and inherently wrong.

We shirked and were found wanting at a
time for greatness.

Letters to Editor

Bound Two In Squabble
Between Women and the
ASTP Units Based Here

To the Editor—

An Open Letter To The Disappointed Lady, Miss M. R.:

Your doctrine of “Dungie Democracy” is a rather desperate
defense for an otherwise inexcusable lack of pride and dignity in

the women on this campus.

The disreputable appearance of
most of the girls here is certainly up-
held by a lofty ideal, and I would be
content to drop the matter now and
put up with these eyesores, if I
thought that democracy was an ap-
propriate reason for their unsightly
apparel. But can any sensible girl,
no matter how blindly liberal, con-
vince herself that looking like a wet
dog is the way to stress democracy
on this campus? Why must you al-
ways head towards extremes? Is
there nothing in between your ap-
pearance or lack of it, and that of
a “kitten-like fem”? Does it require
a million dollars to dress tastefully?
Such artificial self degradation is far
from the way to achieve “real democ-
racy”.

It is gratifying to find that' some
of you girls are here to improve your
minds; it is also interesting to note
that most of those who are here in
that capacity have the good judge-
ment to dress decently. But there
are always exceptions, and of you I
ask, why must you affect a super
studious disregard for social obliga-
tions ?

My dear Miss M.R., what is your
criterion for an attractive woman?
Is a girl who, though possibly beauti-
ful, lacks the good taste, good sense,
or ability to appear presentable when
in public, to be considered attrac-
tive? A misguided sense of democra-
cy is not the sole source of charm in
a woman.

You eloquently mourn the fact that
respectable apparel requires frequent
changing . . . How about the poor
old “Dungies?”

If you girls have no personal pride,
think of those about you, and think
of the appearance and reputation of
the campus. You have spoken of
“glamour colleges;” perhaps the
A.S.T.P. isn’t the only group who
would like to see just a little more
glamour on this campus.

They say we are here for a liberal
education; remember, culture isn’t all

in the mind.

Yours, disgusted at your double
disappointment,

Nauseated Ned
ASTP Beau Brummels
To The Editor:

In reference to the flattering letter
published in the Geisha Gazette and
referred to in the April 6 edition
of The Chicago Maroon, we, the un-
dersigned, as a representative (?)
group of emotionally immature wo-
men on campus, wish to compliment
the ASTP unit on their strikingly
chic appearance. We completely ap-
prove of the new color scheme; the
dashing olive drab, blended with the
soft mellow tones of the sun-tan
shirt, make a stunning spring com-
bination. The fact that the jackets
are always neatly buttoned and the
ties neatly tied, and the pants neat-
ly pressed, and the dainty shoes high-
ly polished, are an indication of dis-
criminating taste. As they march
across campus, heads erect, caps
perched at a jaunty angle, they are
indeed an inspiring spectacle.

The stage of emotional maturity
reached by these model young men
is incredible. It is unfortunate that
these brilliant students of Japanese
will not be here for the extended
period of time that will be required
for the coeds at the University to
mature sufficiently to meet their high
standards. We really fumble at the
great honor of having such a manly
and particularly gentlemanly group
of young men on campus.

Regretfully, apologetically, wor-
shipfully yours,

Friday, April 20, 1945---THE CHICAGO MAROON

Chicago Famed ThruoutWorldFor
Monopoly On Nobel Prize Winners



Respected throughout the world of learning, the Uni-
versity of Chicago has, today, every right to be proud of
its six Nobel Prize winners, for, with the forty-fourth anni-
versary of the Nobel Prize this year, twenty-five Amer-
icans have been recipients, five of whom have been U. of
C. men, and another, a German winner, has transferred
his work to Chicago.

Dean Arthur H. Compton, Charles H. Swift, Distin-
guished Professor of Physics, whose worldwide research
has made his name practically synonymous with cosmic
rays, and Dr. James Franck, eminent chemist and physi-
cist who resigned his position at the University of Got-
tingen the day Hitler assumed power, are the two highly
honored men who today are members of the faculty.

Compton and his colleagues are working on the problems,
fraught with tremendous possibilities to mankind, of releasing
atomic energy. At the age of 10, this physicist-to-be wrote a paper
on the difference between three-toed and five-toed elephants. At
15 he built and flew his own glider. At 17 he was photographing
stars and planets through his own telescope, and while still a
high-school pupil lectured on astronomy to college upperclassmen.

His discovery in 1927 that energy is actually matter gained him
the Nobel Prize for that year. Today he is probably the world’s
foremost experimentalist in the field of radiant energy.

The first American to win the coveted award, Albert Abraham
Michelson, Professor of Physics, became the authority in the field
of optics. He measured the speed of light with an accuracy never
before approached or believed possible. Retiring from the faculty
in 1930, he continued his experiments with the speed of light until
his death in 1931.

In 1912, Dr. Alexis Carrel was given the award “for his
work on muscular ligature and on the grafting of blood vessels
and organs.” Carrel began this work as a member of the Phy-
siological Laboratories at the University in 1905 and 1906.

Robert Andrew Millikan, experimenter in electricity, and the

photoelectric phenonmena, has re-
ceived scores of awards and honors
for his distinguished research. The
year that Millikan won the Nobel
prize, 1923, Compton joined the fac-
ulty. Following Millikan, fourth Uni-
versity man to be honored, was the
first man to show that electrons,
known to be particles, have the prop-
erties of waves: Clinton Joseph Da-
visson was of the class of 1908, and
shared the Nobel award with George
Paget Thompson of the London Uni-
versity. Dr. Davisson has for some
time been a member of the Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories of New York.

The final name on the list is that
of Professor Franck. He shared the
award with Gustav Hertz in 1926.
Just as President Harper’s first an-
nouncement of the new University
attracted scholars from all over the
world, so have the outstanding ac-
complishments of Chicago scientists
brought scholars from the old world.
Today, Dr. Franck is instructing in

physical chemistry in the
of Physical Sciences.

The freedom of research
gether with the excellent

Division

here to-
facilities

has atracted outstanding scholars to
the University. A great deal of re-
search, much of it carefully guarded
by the war department, is now un-
der way on the Quadrangles and will
perhaps be a candidate for future
Nobel awards.

President Spends

Week In New York

President Robert Hutchins will
return Saturday from week-long
conferences in New York City.

Hutchins conferred with officials
of the Encyclopedia Britannica, a
University adjunct, and drafted
plans for further study by the Com-
mission on Freedom of the Press,
a group of which Hutchins is chair-
man.

Ever since the blue jeans battle began, ASTP’s have been calling on the

the men will serenade Green tonight.

Sidelights on Footlights

If you went to live in Driftwood cottage, the scene of Maurice
Dunn’s play, you’d have a pretty irrational time of it. I wouldn’t
go so far as to say that “Driftwood,” presented last Friday and
Saturday nites by O. D. P. is irrational, but merely that it is
built with an inferior grade of theatrical timber.

The plot turns around a Universi-
ty of Chicago professor, who, dis-
illusioned with society loses herself
in the Indiana dunes to find a new
and simple life. Diana, as she is now
called, takes great pleasure in com-
muning with nature, but evidently
does this in such a state of undress
that it disturbs the more respectable
inhabitants. Her “man” Gregg, who
hijack liquor for thirsty prohibition
throats, finds a sailor in the cabin
one night, mistakes his identity, and
kills him. Gregg escapes from prison,
aided by Lorna, the leader of his
gang, who also has her eye on this
desirable male. Faced on one side
by capture if he returns to Diana,
and unhappiness if he spurns his
true love, Gregg is set free when
Diana gently pushes a knife between
his ribs.

It is not within my realm, or even
my powers, to suggest solutions for
Mr. Dunn’s technical problems in
what would prove to be a lengthy
critical field day. Perhaps, however,
the addition of a sub-plot would stab-
ilize the action, now improbable due
to incomplete character development.
By invent i n g
action to in-	—

volve the frus-
trated Blake
and the artist
philand e r e r,
Marden, not on-
ly would these y I
two be provided
with firmer mo-	\

tives but they	\ \

in turn might	\\

lead to a fur-	>►•

ther explana-
t i o n of the

1920’s of Gregg and his gang. Whe-
ther the sub-plot is used makes no
difference,'but a way must be paved
for these numerous forces to act

with plausibility on Diana. Something
ought to be arranged for the sailor
too, now in his deus ex machina hea-
ven, who was necessary to point
Diana’s escapist tendencies, but might
have been less obvious. If we are
to accept the central idea—Diana’s
discovery that there is no freedom,
even in nature—then Mr. Dunn is
going to have to give his actors
more material on which to work.
This includes dialogue not quite so
strictly dated.

Martha McCain, did on the whole,
a splendid job with Diana. She man-
aged to make the dialogue at least
believable, which was a feat under
the circumstances. The three beach-
combers were skillfully played by
Elizabeth Reisinger, Marabelle Smith
and Jean Cooke. Sid Burks gave an ex-
cellent Marden, carrying on in style
even with a broken foot. John Tar-
burton as Gregg did well, as did
Curtis Crawford and George Voas
in the roles of Geno and the sailor.
Roberta Unger did a good piece of
stock work with Blake, and Sis Er-
sner was adequate as Lorna. The
staging and lighting were distinctly
professional, for which Charles Walls,

Lorie Dodge, and Alan Boulton
responsible.

The original music by Arpad
sounded a bit like Schoenberg to

are

EIo
me,

but it was effective, and served its
purpose if it helped Miss McCain
thru her more dramatic moments.

Flag At Half Mast

As a result of gubernatorial pro-
clamation, the flag on the University
mastpole will fly at half mast for one
month in commemoration of former
President Roosevelt’s death.

The flag is lofted briefly to the top
of the pole and is then lowered to

Thespian Tribute

The end of the third act of “Driftwood” proved the most
interesting time of the evening. During the play a group of stu-
dents sat anxiously in the first two rows and strove mightily to
conceal a large box and a larger bundle; the former was especially
hard to hide, for an odor (white flax) emanated strongly from it,
despite the tightly closed lid. Came the end of the act and the
first curtain call—when up sped two modern Mercuries (one was a
rather unusual looking female and the other an unusual looking
male) and literally threw the contents of the box and the bundle
at Sid Burks and Roberta Unger respectively. Bewildered, Sid
put his hand up and removed a large wreath from his head (it is
impossible to describe it, though we can say its crowning feature
was a pink plush monstrosity supplemented by flowers, some known
to God and some to Woolworth’s, on a base of pink pussy willows).
Miss Unger was the proud recipient of three large calla lillies
dedicated to the Lily of the Hoosier State. On last word, Sid was
still scrubbing the scent from his brunette locks.

Coach Ned Merriam still does not believe his ears—at the last track

is an absent-minded doctor who is quite haughty about his lack of memory;
that is, he used to be haughty until one day a nurse, walking down the hall,
came upon him standing before the mirror outside the operating room, with
his hands on his hips; he stared at himself and muttered. “Well, you big ox,
what are you going to forget today?”

The expansion of 'southern credit
during the Civil War caused a drastic
retrenchment of the economy known
as the Era of Reconstruction. The
entire was made extremely arduous
for both the North and South by one
of the bad habits of the northern sol-
diers. They were so used to marching
that they were unable to stop even in
their own houses, as is shown by the
contemporary song “Johnny comes
marching, home!” This practice soon
wore out a huge percentage of North,
ern rugs, forcing Northerners to look
to the South for more. The men who
went to the South to ask for more
rugs were generally known as the

carpet beggers. In retaliation for
not finding any carpet, the carpet
beggers planted in the South the Dem-
ocratic party, sectionalism, etc. It is
generally acknowledged that it would
have been far better to have planted
the carpet beggers The solution of
the problem was found in an elastic
rug invented by several British noble-
men who became so prominent that
this is also known as the Era of the
Rubber Barons.

In the north at this time a wave of
patriotic fervor gripped the country.
Streets, parks, and towns were named

for heroes of the war.

era, Lincoln, Sheridan, and Broadway.

BATTERED MAROONS SEEK 1st WIN

Maroons Enter

Baseball’s Big Berthas....

Triangular At
North Central

Opening its 1945 outdoor
track season, the Chicago Ma-
roon thinclads will participate
in a triangular meet with
Wheaton and North Central
College at North Central’s track
in Naperville, Illinois Saturday.
Holding victories over both op-
ponent schools in the indoor sea-
son, Chicago goes to Naperville
a slight favorite although Coach
Ned Merriam’s team has lost
some of its strength since the
winter competitions.

The Maroons will probably travel
light, carrying at the most 10 men,
all of them participating in two or
more events. Naval student Wal-
lace Turtelotte, top University
dash man, will not make the trip

and his successor, Earl Dinklelocker
still has some conditioning to do.

Coach Marriam has been hard
pressed to find a good miler but
veteran cross-country runner John

Bokman may be able to hold his own
over the long distance. Bokman is
planning to high jump and run in the
relay and he may also return to his
original 880 run.

Dinkleocker, Sjoerdsma and Hill
will all throw the javelin and shot
while Dinklelocker and Sjoerdsma
will heave the discus. The stockily
built Sjordsma is the Maroon’s one
pole valuter. Robert Voas, new-
comer to the track team, has been
working out on the mile and will
confine his efforts to four laps of
the track.

Steady, dependable Paul Russell,

meet.

AAU Gymnast Contest HereToday

The national renowned University of Chicago gymnast team,
coached by Bud Beyer, a champion in his own right, plays host
to the Central A. A. U. high school gymnastic meet tomorrow
at Bartlett Gym.

Facing their first test under fire
the University men in the high school
class will meet Senn, all city cham-
pion and Lindbloom, the second place
winner in the city meet. Harrison
and Lane high schools will also partic-
ipate and the meet as a whole is
expected to be one of the highlights
of the 1945 season.

Restricted to men in the first
two years of the college, Coach
Beyer will be depending on Gor-
don Sherman, last year’s novice
champion in the A. A. U. open
meet, to lead his young squad
to victory. Working with Sher-
man are John Gammers, Jack

Louisville lumber of this quartet
to lift the Maroons up out of the
doldrums. Pictured (left to right)
are Bill Harrison, first base candi-
date; Fred Cimmerblatt, center field

Miners, Bill Boylston and Dave
Sampsell.

One of the focal points of the meet
is the tumbling competition and
Boylston is expected to show strongly
against the Senn and Lindblom
champions. The University is
hampered by the limitations which
the A. A. U. imposes since average
age of University men in the first
two years of the college is less than
that of the men in the public high
schools. However, under the expert
direction of Beyer, winner of 3 na-
tional championships in 1938 when
he was captain of the Chicago colle-
giate squad, the young gymnasts

guardian; Kurt Smith, third base;
and Jim Peliotes, first base. (Photo

staff Photographer).

should put up a strong fight for the
team title.

On the following Saturday, Bartlett
gym will house the Central A. A. U.
open meet. Chicago will be at a defi-
nite advantage in this meet as Louis
Levit, men’s senior champion in 1944,
will compete along with Sherman and
Ernest Hillard, place winner in the
same meet. Competition begins on
the afternoon of April 21 in the high
school meet and it begins on the
following Saturday afternoon for the
men’s open.

Purdue U. To

Appear Here
Next Tuesday
To Play Western Michigan
Saturday at Kalamazoo

By MARSHALL LOWENSTEIN

Still in the red after two
games, the Chicago Maroons bid
for their first victory of the cam-
paign tomorrow at Kalamazoo
against Western Michigan.

Flattened 18-4 Wednesday at
Northwestern in a twice-post-
poned contest the Maroons are on
the road again Saturday and back
on the home stamping grounds
for a duel with the University of
Purdue this Tuesday. Tuesday’s
game against the Boilermakers
is scheduled for 4 p.m. on the
Midway diamond. There will be
no admission charge.

Chicago took an early lead in the
first half of the first inning Wednes-
day against Evanston when the
Northwestern moundsman Ed Schultz
passed out five free tickets to first
base. The Maroons managed to
capitalize on the walks with the as-
sistance of one Northwestern error
to push across three runs. North-
western came back in the second half
of the same inning to score four of
its own men and to take a lead which
it never relinquished.

Chicago was charged with 11
errors though Maroon twirlers were
nicked for 15 base hits. Pitchers
Lefty Hauck and Dick Staughton at-
tempted to halt the Northwestern
onrush.

The jitters which were evident in
the opening game against Illinois
Tech two weks ago are stil present,
but Coach J. Kyle Anderson, still
optimistic, hopes that practice and
action wil rub off the rough spots.

Saturday’s game puts the Maroons
up against an opponent that holds a
5 to 4 victory over the strong Uni-
versity of Michigan squad.

College Track
Team On Road

The college track team, fresh from
a decisive double victory over Leo
high, travels to Harvey, Illinois this
afternoon to meet Thornton and Blue
Island high schools at the Thornton
track.

In this field trip, the senior and
junior teams will pit their strength
against two of the strongest teams of
the track-minded South Suburban
League. Thornton considers its teams
enough to join the Suburban League,
which is made up of such track-re-
knowned schools as Oak Park and
New Trier, and Blue Island is thought
to be the team to beat in the Southern
half of Cook County.

The Chicago teams gave ample
demonstration of their skill by wal-
loping St. Leo, 70% to 42% in the
senior division and 64 to 32 in the
junior loop last Tuesday afternoon.

The junior victory was greatly aided
by captain Bob Linsicome’s 35%
points. This amazing total was earned
with six wins in the 50 and 100 yard
dashes, the 110 low hurdles, the discus
throw, the broad jump and the high
jump. Linsicome’s second place in
the 220 yard dash, his third in the
shot put and his running of the anchor
lap of the junior relay rounded out
one of the best all around perform-
ances ever made on the Stagg field
track.

---- THE CHICAGO MAROON
Letters.,.

(Continued from page 4)
an official day of mourning was
observed by decree of the na-
tion’s new president.

YET ...

While radio networks swept aside
all scheduled programs,

while theaters closed and floor-
shows were cancelled,

while department stores locked
their doors and drew their curtains,

while all over the city people chose
to walk humbly and silently—

YET, while Chicago mourned, The
Office of Dramatic Productions found
voice to roar “The Show Must Go
On!!” and go on, it did.

I didn’t attend either performance
of “Driftwood.” I sincerely hope the
cast was successful. I sincerely hope
the audience was entertained. I sin-
cerely hope the University’s reputa-
tion was upheld. But let me now ask
WHY ODP felt compelled to present
its play when this city and the coun-
try, and indeed the world, felt rather
compelled to pay the simple honor of
solemnity to our late President? ? ?

We of the University of Chicago
must readjust our sense of perspec-
tive if we really believe ourselves
to exist beyond the realm of the
contemporary scene. Our intellectuals
and our dreamers and our budding
stage stars cannot isolate themselves
from the conventions and bounds of
society. We are still very much a
part of that society AND thus far,
at least, we are not important enough
to cry “The Show Must Go On!!!”
at a time when the show becomes
inappropriate, undesirable, and of-
fensive

No Mourning Here

To the Editor:

“Campus Mourns F. D. R.’s
Death”; that was your headline,
but was it true? No mention of
it was made in any of my classes
—what about yours? No classes
were cancelled, either; no official
memorial service was held.

Even the poorest little shops in the
neighborhood closed for a few hours
“in respect to our beloved President.”
But the University of Chicago hadn’t
sorrow enough to warrant a five min-
ute silence.

Are we so far removed from the
common people of this land that we
are insensible to their grief. If any
of us were unmoved by the passing
of so great a man, couldn’t we at

least respect their sorrow?

Perhaps nobody else cared, but one
student of the College was ashamed
of her school and its barrenness of
heart.
