Noted Artist



Commuters To

Adopt Stand

Awaiting official commuter action,
dormitory representatives marked
time in their Wednesday night meet-
ing. At the outset of the discussion
it was requested by the chairman,
William Washington, that no motions
be made and no plans adopted until
after the commuters have met on the
sixteenth.

Discussion was devoted to consider-
ation of possible methods of repre-
sentation in a student government.
Six student-drafted plans were read
and widely criticized by the assembly.

One of these plans cite a need for
two separate student organizations,
a Council of Student Organizations
to promote social and cultural activi-
ties and a separate Student Council.
Two of the other plans saw need for
representation of “special interest
groups” in a student organization.

It was argued by several that
system providing for commuter
dormitory representatives would
den the breech between these

any
and
wi-

two

groups. The way to eliminate dorm-
commuter friction, they contended,
was by providing for a campus-wide
general election of representatives.

In answer to this argument, oppo-
nents held that the dormitory and
commuter group distinction offered
the most natural and efficient basis
for representation. Furthermore they
said, such distinction would not widen
the breach, but would be the only
honest way to solve the problems of
integration.

A need to define the powers of stu-
dent government was also expressed
during the meeting. An example of
one of the potential functions was the
chartering of student activities. These
activities now receive recognition from
the Office of the Dean.

Although many opinions were aired
at the Wednesday meeting, positive
action toward the formation of stu-
dent government will remain at a
stand-still until the commuters or-
ganize. The next meeting, one of
both dormitory and official commuter
representatives will be held on Wed-
nesday, February 21, in the Burton
East Lounge.

Plan Marks Time
Pending Decision
By Non-Residents

Asserting that plans to create a
University of Chicago student council
have been brought to a standstill by
failure of the commuter students to
adopt a stand, a 7-man committee
yesterday called on the 1,000 non-
campus students to gather next Fri-
day at 3:30 in Oriental Institute to
formulate their program.

The plan for student government
which has aroused widespread discus-
sion on the campus was marking time
this week as proponents regrouped
their forces and awaited action by the
commuters, a necessary contingency
to further action.

The commuter students who repre-

Expect Large Throngs At Play

“The Inspector General”, Gogol’s
biting satire on small town politics,
will be presented by the Office of
Dramatic Productions, in Mandel Hall,
Friday and Saturday nights at eight-
thirty. As the first large scale pro-
duction of the Winter Quarter, it
marks a high point in director, Jere
Mickel’s plans for the season. With
the opening of the Reynolds Club,
which has been occupied by the Army
for two years, it is expected that
future plays, including “Driftwood”,
will be staged in that theatre.

Maynard Wishner, who was last
seen in Lynn Riggs’, “Green Grow the
Lilacs” will take the part of Hlestakov,
the passionate impostor, mistaken by
the populace of a small town for the
Inspector General. Ossip, his servant,
will be played by George Sorter. Ar-
thur Cohen will play the buffoonish
mayor of the town, Margaret Kramer
will play his middle-aged, coquettish
wife, and Roberta Unger will play his
daughter. John Tarburten will don
judicial robes to become a judge, Mar-
vin Mindes will be the postmaster, Roy
Pakensky, the Inspector of Police. Ro-
berta Unger, Margaret Kramer, and

French. Friday from 4:00 to 5:30
p.m. is the time set for all future
Faculty-Student Teas sponsored
by the War Stamp Committee.

An exhibit of war trophies, among
them a Nazi flag, will be set up in the
library for the tea this week.

Tau Sigma Upsilon and Chi Rho
Sigma will provide refreshments.
Hostesses include representatives from
both clubs, and Aileen Baron, Alice

Commuters Meet Next Friday
At Oriental To Chart Stand

sent over 55 per cent of the campus
have named no spokesmen as of yet
to meet with the dormitory delegates

to thrash out proposals for the
ernment which is scheduled to
grate the college activity slate.

The spontaneous committee

gov-
inte-

has

urged every commuter on the campus
to attend the next Friday’s conclave.
A circular is being mailed to all com-
uter students calling on them to ex-
press either a negative or affirmative
stand.

The circular warned that failure of
the commuters to take action would
lead to domination of the campus by
the dormitories and would knife one

IF Council Revises Rushing
Code; To Penalize Violators

Interfraternity Council has announced several additions and
revisions in the fraternity rushing code. President Jack Welch,
Phi Gamma Delta, announced that revisions were made because of
the change in the rush week schedule this quarter. The new
schedule cuts rushing down to only one week.

Chief changes allow rushing until
11 p.m. and at the homes of actives,
and increase the penalty for illegial
rushing by prohibiting freshmen from
pledging the guilty fraternity.

Rush week starts February 18,
and ends February 24. All after-
noons up to six p.m. are open.
The evening schedule is as follows:
Sunday, Open rushing for all fra-
ternities; Monday, Phi Gamma Delta,
Phi Sigma Delta; Tuesday, Sigma
Chi, Pi Lambda Phi; Wednesday, Psi
Upsilon, Phi Sigma Delta; Thursday,
Alpha Delta Phi, Pi Lambda Phi;
Friday, Open rushing for all frater-
nities. On Saturday, Febraury 24,
from nine to twelve a.m., all freshmen
desiring to pledge a fraternity must

of the original intents of the student
government project.

The committee, which includes Gene
Miroff, Tom Rogers, Will Sparks, Vir-
ginia' Mainzen, David Brill, Pat Del-
son, and Angela Mastraoddi, has been
established solely to conduct next Fri-
day’s parley. It will cease to exist
after that meeting.

It is expected that the commuters
will name a committee to meet with
the dormitory delegates and to vote
on various proposals. Non-official
commuter delegates have been attend-
ing the dormitory sessions but have
been banned from speaking, pending
official action by the commuters.

Will Conduct
February 27

By William R. Wambaugh
(Music Editor, Chicago Maroon)
Assistant Professor of Music
and Director of the Composer’s
Concerts, Remi Gassman, an-
nounced today that the next com-
poser’s concert will be devoted
to the music of Heitor Villa-
Lobos, Brazil’s greatest living
composer and internationally fa-
mous musician.

The date of the concert, orig-
inally scheduled for Feb. 16, has
been changed to Tuesday, Feb. 27,
because of Villa-Lobos’ appear-
ances with the New York, Phil-
adelphia and Boston symphonies
earlier in the month.

Villa-Lobos had intended to return
to Brazil following his appearance
with the Boston orchestra on Feb. 24,
but he was persuaded to extend his
visit in this country in order to par-
ticipate in the Composer’s series at
the University.

The program of the 27th will in-
clude Villa-Lobos’ Choros No. 7 (1924)
for flute, oboe, clarinet, alto saxo-
phone, bassoon, violin, and violoncello;
Quartet (1931) for flute, harp, alto
saxophone, and celesta; Trio No. 3
(1921) for piano, violin, and ’cello;
and Bachiana Brasileira No. 1 (1932)
for eight ’cellos. These works will
be performed by a group of first
desk men of the Chicago Symphony,
and Mr. Villa-Lobos will conduct the
Choros and Bachiana Brasileira.

Villa-Lobos, born in Rio de Janeiro,
March 5, 1881, began to study music
with his father. When he was eleven
years of age, his father died and he
was forced to earn a living, playing
in theater and restaurant orchestras.
In 1912 he joined an expedition into
Brazil’s interior to study native cus-
toms and music. In 1922 he went to
Europe on a government pension to
study. Returning to Brazil in 1931,
he was appointed director of music
of the Rio schools.

All Ready For
U. of C. Radio
Station Debut

Final details are being completed
and all is virtually in readiness for
opening broadcasting, Campus Radio
Station Manager Hank Ruby announ-
ced yesterday.

The new station, WCHI, will begin
broadcasts the latter part of next
week on a position on the dial yet to
be determined. Scripts are being
written and program plans completed
for opening broadcasts.

Ruby also announced that the stu-
dio has obtained headquarters on the
second floor of the Judson lounge. Its
equipment will be set up there and
it will broadcast over the steampipe
lines of the University.

Plans call for most early programs
to be of transcribed music and discus-

Student Fund
Drive Starts

For the past week, the World Stu-
dent Service Fund Drive has been in
progress on campus. Campaign func-
tions, sponsored by various student
organizations, have not yet reached
individual students. Many, though
aware of the drive, do not realize its
necessity.

The YWCA gave a Snowball Lunch-
eon Thursday to raise funds for the
drive, and Miss Hilde Mayer, traveling
secretary of the WSSF has spoken at
meetings sponsored by campus groups.

The purpose of the WSSF is four-
fold, one, it provides direct relief for
students and professionals who are
victims of war; two, it is the Amer-
ican student’s part in the world enter-
prise of student-to-student help; three,
it provides aid where it is needed most,
on an international, interracial, non-
sectarian, non-political basis; four, it
means “reconstruction” now.

Furthermore, the WSSF is the only
organization in this country through
which American students can help fel-
low students in need. Inter-Club
Council is providing girls who will be

Round Table
To Spotlight
Abe Lincoln

In observance of Abraham Lincoln’s
birthday, the University of Chicago
Round Table will present a special
program Sunday at 12:30 p.m. when
three speakers will discuss problems
suggested by Lincoln’s words, “with
malice toward none.”

Guests will be: J. G. Randell, Pro-
fessor of History, University of
Illinois; Avery Craven, Professor of
History, University of Chicago; and
Lt. Col. T. V. Smith, on leave from
the Department of Philosophy, Uni-
versity of Chicago.

The program will be concerned with
the problems of Lincoln’s administra-
tion in the Civil War and the wartime
emergencies which faced him. Prob-
lems of that war in relation to the
present crisis will be discussed.

Pros and Cons of
Student Government
Discussed by Forum

“Should we have a student govern-
ment?” was the question debated at
an open meeting sponsored by the
Student Forum last Tuesday. Burt
Rosner presented the affirmative side
of the argument, stating the aims of
such an organization; integration of
commuters and residents and of vari-
ous levels of the college, and better
faculty-student communication.

The negative stand was defended
by Gene Miroff who argued that there
is no need for student organization.
Grievances can be handled in other
ways. Such an organization, he said,
could never be truly representative.

Krueger to Speak
For Socialist Club

Maynard C. Krueger will discuss
‘‘Socialism and Russia” at an open
meeting sponsored by the Socialist
Club, on Monday, February 19th at
3:00 p.m. in Social Science 122. The
neeting will be conducted as a lec-
ture-discussion. Professor Krueger
will discuss the political, economic,
tnd social developments, as well as
the foreign policy of the Soviet Un-
ions.

A membership meeting will be held
this Monday at 7:30 p.m. in Social
Science 105." All members are urged
to attend.

Hillel Schedules Festival To
Open New Foundation Home

All students of the University and their friends are invited
to “Streets of Shushan”, the first Hillel Purim Festival to be held
in the Foundation’s new house at 5715 Woodlawn, on Sunday
evening, February 25, from seven till one.

In the mysterious setting of a Per-
sian city, a program of vivid enter-
tainment will be presented, including
dancing to a five-piece orchestra, a
floor show with Maynard Wishner as
m.c., a Queen Esther beauty contest
and an assortment of amusement
booths. As special guests, the organ-
ization has invited students from
Northwestern University, Illinois and
Chicago Medical Schools, and service-
men. All proceeds from the celebra-
tion will go to charity.

To Hold Calvert Club Dance

Calvert Club members and guests
will dance tomorrow evening to the
music of the Thorntoneers at the
club’s Mardi Gras Dance. The party
will be held from eight until twelve
in the Ida Noyes Theatre.

Decorations, planned by Veva Hop-
kins, will be in the joyous pre-Lanten
theme. Dancing and refreshments
will complete the evening. Mickey
Brennan, originally slated to play, is
now replaced by the Thorntoneers.

Committee heads Helen Toman,
Helen Flood, and Marie Jeanne
Martin have been working this week
to make this party which is open to
all, the success that last quarter’s
was. Admisison is fifty cents per per-
son.

Methodist Club Seminar

Each Thursday evening for the
next five weeks the Methodist Student
League will conduct a seminar in wor-
ship as part of its regular fellowship
supper meetings. Led by Dr. Ross
Snyder, professor of religious educa-
tion on the Federated Theological
Faculties, the group will consider the
relationship of worship to everyday
living.

Dean Faulkner Speaks

Chapel Union’s meeting last
Sunday evening featured Dean
Faulkner of Fiske University who
spoke on “Patterns of Segrega-
tion”. Out of slavery, he said, has
grown a great crop of discrimin-
atory laws—“patterns of segrega-
tion” causing legal as well as
social discrimination.

The patterns are being broken, how-
ever, he added, as may be seen in the
procuring of equal pay for both Negro
and white teachers in some states.

Next Sunday, February 11, Joseph
Lohman will speak on “Peacetime Con-
scription”. The meeting will he held
at 5802 Woodlawn at 7:45.

Student Group Begins Meetings

The Westminster Student Group has
just begun a new series of meetings
called “The Wrestle of Religion With
Truth”. Each of the various prom-
inent philosophic-religions will be pre-
sented. The next meeting will be held
on Wednesday, at 6 p.m. with the suc-
c e e d i n g. meetings following fort-
nightly.

Graduate English
Students Organize

The Graduate English Club was
formed last Tuesday evening, Febru-
ary 6. This group answers a long
felt need among graduate English
students for a means whereby they
can meet and discuss their common
interests, receive and exchange ideas
in their field, and become acquainted
with each other. Napier Wilt fac-
ulty sponsor of the group, discussed
at the first meeting the possibilities
for such a Club. It was agreed by
all that the Club should be informal,
and that the seminar and formal guest
speaker formulas should be avoided
as far as possible.

The group will meet the first and
third Tuesday of each month in So-
cial Science Commons, with possibly
one of the two meetings devoted to
creative writing. Notices of meet-
ings will be posted well in advance on
the bulletin boards. Jerry Taylor
will act as chairman of the group,
with Glen Davis as secretary, Mar-
guerite Hayes in charge of refresh-
ments, Annette Weiss, program
chairman, and Mitchell Schrero,
treasurer.

The “Welcome” mat is spread for
other Humanities students and the
English department faculty, and it is
hoped that they will come to the bi-
monthly gatherings to share coffee
and ideas.

Moving In Right Direction

University of Chicago undergraduates have long been notori-
ous for the cursory attention they give to developments of major
import within their own midst. And it is thus altogether likely
that announcement of a formation of a veterans council on the
campus in last week’s journal was given either the cold shoulder
ox* passed over without a second glance.

Actually, establishment of the council is much more than a
straw in the wind and poses the most momentous development in
recent weeks as regards post-war adjustment of veterans on the
campus. President Hutchins’ assertion that more care should be
taken by the army in selecting prospective students under the GI
plan was the first gun fired in the campaign. The veterans have
now taken the matter into their own hands.

It is certainly not a military secret to report that the Univer-
sity policy has in the past and will probably continue to turn a cold
shoulder to select and exclusive pressure or social groups. Yet,
the veterans council is thriving under a benevolent smile. The
administrative authorities are well aware that such a council,
springing from the veterans themselves and from their interests,
can command far more influence than the most laudable and
praiseworthy projects which might be passed down from on high.

It is to be hoped, however, that the Chicago group will not
don the garb of a high-riding hell-bent elite social unit that similar
groups have become at other universities. The club’s five point
program built on the solid bedrock of readjustment of the veteran
is a most praiseworthy one.

Other students at the University can well take a page from
the veterans’ book. This group, without the usual fumbling, has
taken direct and constructive action to provide itself with the
machinery for dealing with its own problems. There was no
passing of the buck to others for those necessary solutions.
Civilian students should do no less in terms of student government.

The transformations of Ruth Dra-
per, who appeared in Mandel Hall last
Friday night, seem magical. Yet her
art is, in truth, mightier than that
of Houdini, for the strongest illusions
she presents do not depend on ap-
paratus.

Miss Draper herself belongs to the
conservative branch of New York
society, and her sketches of those in
the “upper brackets” delighted the
audience, as always, but fully as
agreeably received were the other
monologues. First of the six was an
old English countess opening a ba-
zaar. As the scene gradually ma-
terialized, this woman, addressing
characters right and left, captivated
every eye and kept them all upon her,
without exception, until, adjusting for
the fiftieth time her boa, and waving
her lorgnette, she moved from the

stage.

She returned a moment later as
luncheon hostess to a quartette of
wdmen at a restaurant in the sketch
entitled “Doctors and Diets.” Thirty
years experience fairly jumped out
with each utterance—all framed in
the material which she writes her-
self. This was followed by a domestic
court scene involving three genera-
tions. Here the vehicle of portrayal
was masterful, but the content did
not live up to those sketches pro-
ceeding or following it. The young
girl in this sketch presented, per-
haps, the most persuasive appeal of
the three.

A final trio, chosen, as Miss Draper
commented later, for their variety,
had first the seacaptain’s wife on
their porch in Maine, and then the
debutante. They were both supurb.
The Maine sketch is as famous as
her “Three Women and Mr. Clifford.”
I have no doubt that these two would
have brought a less-conservative audi-
ence to its feet.

Student Health, A Service?

Mr. Lowenstern’s letter about Student Health Service in an-
other column brings into focus a lamentable and serious condition
which has existed so long on campus that it assumes the proportion
of a tradition. There is scarcely a student, who has been at the
University for a quarter or more, who doesn’t possess his personal
repetoire of hair-raising tales regarding Student Health. Like
other traditions, many of the stories are losing their factual
significance and are rapidly becoming part of local mythology.

However, there is still ample reason for each and every student
on campus who pays his health fee to ask why it is necessary for
anyone desiring a complete physical examination to wait three
weeks for an appointment, or why people have to make their own
diagnoses before being admitted to see a doctor. We refer, of
course, to the query of the admission desk, “What is wrong with
you and why do you want to see a doctor?” Furthermore, it is
completely logical for a student to ask why Student Health offers
no dental service or an extremely limited optometrical service.

The University is a large community and should possess
medical facilities commensurate with such a community. It is
especially ironical when one notes that the Medical School and
Billings Hospital have some of the greatest names in the profession
on their staffs and some of the most significant developments in
medical science have stemmed from the University laboratories.

Then, why should a girl who is in a chronic state of lassitude
be told that she is too fat and eats too much, when a more competent
diagnosis showed a serious anemia. Can it be that the student
health fee doesn’t meet the costs of maintaining adequate service
for all students, many of whom are from outside Chicago and,
therefore, completely dependent upon the University? Or is it,
rather, incompetent direction and supervision that allows inad-
equate service and, in some cases, outright discrimination to con-
tinue year after year? By all means, this is a matter for immedi-
ate administrative action.

In 1913 she composed a French war
sketch which found its perfect sequel
in 1940. This she chose for her last
appearance. Onto the stage in black
peasant costume came a French
soldier’s wife prepared to bid him
adieu as he set sail for the Dover
coast from Brittany. Speaking in
French she seccessively comforted the
mother-in-law and portrayed the
rendezvous with great feeling.

And so Miss Draper, carrying her
small bundle of hats, shawls, and
coats, took leave, but when she
chooses to return, a capacity house
will await her, awaiting another mar-
velously rich evening of entertain-
ment.

Letters to Editor

Student Health Service
Is Denounced as Farce
To the Editor:

The purpose of this letter is to expose the farce of the Student
Health Service to the members of the University and to demand
action in rectifying the wrongs committed in the operation of this
service. I have heard little good spoken of the Health Service
since I entered the University in September, 1943, but never had
occasion to verify this hearsay until the past week.

On Monday, January 29, I went to
the Health Service, with what I con-
sidered a bad cold. I saw Dr. D. B.
Reed, head of the service, who pre-
scribed the customary rubber-stamped
cures for me without any examination,
without even so much as taking my
temperature, and then sent me on my
way.

On Wednesday, the 31st, I went to
a private physician, who, after a com-
plete physical examination, including
an X-ray, diagnosed my “cold” as
virus pneumonia. This physician said
that I could have been cured much
sooner than the expected two weeks if
my “cold” had been properly diagnosed
by means of examination on Monday.

The purpose of Student Health is to
help students keep fit in order to
attend classes, not to lull them into a
false sense of security by means of
wrong diagnoses and sheer negligence,
thus causing them to miss even more
classes.

The Student Health Service, because
of the action described above, and
because of others of similar nature,
is not representative of the so-called
institution of higher learning of which
it is a part. The University should
investigate this condition and correct
it as soon as possible.

With the hope that this letter will
be published so as to expose this con-
dition to all concerned, I am

Your truly,

PRO HUTCHINS

(Ed. Note: We reprint the following
letter, written by a graduate student
in the Political Science Department,
believing that it will prove of interest
to the student body at large.)

Dear Brother Gertz:

In reference to your article in the
February Lawyers' Guild Monthly—
you asked for it; here it is.

It appears to me that you are rather
relying upon the Chicago Daily News
editorial of April 24, 1944, to support
your views. This, of course, is valid,
but I see the case of University of
Chicago vs. Hutchins as a conflict of
ideologies similar to what is transpir-
ing in political governments today.
It is the resurgence of the masses, i.e.,
faculty, already strongly intrenched
and immoveable; the latter empowered
with directives with which the masses
must comply.

First, to emphasize the analogy be-
tween the school government and a
civil or political government: the gov-
erned, i.e., the student body, must be
vested with some of the devices and
processes of democracy. No political,
economical, or ecclesiastical absolutism
has ever ruled with such rigorous
bigotry as a college faculty; and their
edicts, curriculum, and bulls have come
down to us through the ages with little
or no change. Left to their own voli-
tion, they would still serve as a classi-
cal example of medieval feudalism
turning out automatons. I can think
of no institution so badly in need of
restraint as a college professor. A
product of his own creating, he re-
mains a eonstant threat to the per-

sonal rights and liberties of the Uni-
versity community.

Second: Fundamentally, Hutchins
has sensed the moral and civil demands
of the University community, i.e,, the
student body, in its relationship to the
faculty, i.e., the Senate. He has con-
trivuted the manumission of the stu-
dent body from the absolutism of the
faculty, and it is to be hoped that he
awaits only the propitious moment
when he will establish a Peoples’ Court
and a Court of Appeal for the student
body as well as a legislative assembly.

There is no segment of our popula-
tion which is impressed with greater
responsibilities than the age group
represented in the student body of a
University, and none which have fewer
rights or voice. The student body has
no Magna Charta as a guarantee of
its fundamental liberties as people; no
day in court, no right of appeal, nor
right of counsel.

Hutchins is a buffer between the
impact of absolutism of the faculty
and the student body, i.e., the masses.
Every innovation introduced by him
has inured to the benefit of the masses,
and lessens the grip of the faculty
upon the student. Some day he may
take the epitome of reforms he has
instituted and say to the student:
“Here, sonny! Here’s your Bill of
Rights!”

Color Films to Be
Shown Here Friday

“Snow Magic” and “Life in Stock-
holm,” two color films, will unreel
before members of the Scandinavian
Club on Friday, February 9 at 7:30
p.m. in Social Science 122.

After the movie the group will ad-
journ to the Common Room for a
short business meeting. Officers for
the remainder of the school year are
to be elected at this time. Informal
singing will follow with the aid of the
new song books recently presented
to the club.

To finish the evening in customary
Swedish manner, coffee and cake will
be served. Anyone of Scandinavian
ancestry is invited to join the group.

The Art Club is sponsoring an ex-
hibit of student paintings, which will
be on display in Harper Library soon.
This exhibit of the group’s outstand-

two paintings every six weeks.

In addition, the organization is con-
tinuing the sketching class held every
Tuesday evening, from eight to ten,
at the Hyde Park Art Center. In-
coming students are particularly in-
vited by Art club officials to the
sketching class, and to the teas held
every Friday afternoon at 4:30 in
Goodspeed Hail for which a series of
interesting talks on the various as-
pects of art are being planned.

Mr. Steig has managed, in “The Lonely

obsessions with startling adroitness.

“All Embarrassed” is more special-

ized; the main title of each picture
being “Embarrassment,” but Steig has
made this a bigger book than the
other. The technique is somewhat dif-
ferent, mainly in that the drawings
are more literal. This makes them
easier to understand, in a sense, but
they are no longer so much “pure
investigation of the spirit” as abstrac-
tions from types of minor situations
in which we all frequently find our-
selves.

As it seems to have become an
axiom of the humor business that no
satire is up-to-date unless it shows
the frustration a modern man due to
the machine age, a forward to this
effect has dutifully been provided.
Please ignore it. The “props” are
twentieth century in contrast to “The
Lonely Ones”, which has no props, but
that shouldn’t fool anyone for a min-
ute. Most of the forms of embarrass-
ment are dependent only on long-
established social patterns, and many
would be recognized by the Cro-Mag-
nons.

There are also some grotesque draw-
ings whose relation to the topic is
tenuous, and they are very good, too.

people cold. If you are one of these,
don’t expect any sympathy from this

— THE CHICAGO MAROON

Judy Downs

Servin' It Hot

Esquire’s 1945 Jazz Book comes out
as an interesting contribution to jazz
literature. Its serious, almost philo-
sophical approach to jazz is com-
mendable; in Paul Miller’s “Main
Currents of Jazz” we have a fresh,
intelligent attitude toward jazz as an
art. Discarding the old classifications
of the styles according to geographi-
cal situations (the New Orleans style,
the Chicago style, the Kansas City
style, etc.) Miller presents divisions
based on emotional attitudes of the
artists, having concluded that the
fundamental characteristic of jazz is
its reflection of the musician’s emo-
tional attitude towards society. These
attitudes he classifies under the five
headings of the Blues, the Romantic,
the Lyric, the Decadent, and the Pro-
test, with various instrumentalists
listed under each. While he does fail
to attain the degree of clarity neces-
sary for complete conviction, the ap-
proach is certainly fresh and inter-
esting.

The “all star jazz bands” selected
by Esquire’s “board of experts” re-
main a farce, in view of the selection
of the voters, not to mention the not
too subtle tampering with the votes.
The small but fierce internal jazz
war rages on, paradoxically, with
intensity equal to that of the external
campaign for popular appreciation.

Jazz Quarterly’s Chicago Issue has
recently been released and is sold on
campus at the University and Wood-
worth’s Book Stores. We have here
32 pages of “what happened to jazz
in Chicago” from the eyes of the mu-
sician, the critic, and the interested
bystander. Charles Payne Rogers an-
alyzes “The Chicago Style”; pianist
Tut Soper reveals his personal “Phi-
losophy of Chicago Jazz”; two women
who married Chicago clarinetists and
who were intimately associated with
the jazz world reveal what they ob-
served on the scene. Kay Jacobson
tells of her Bud and the rest of the
gang at the Golden Pumpkin, and
Priscilla Boyden Rushton recalls the
fabulous sessions at Squirrel Ash-
kraft’s house. Pianist Leonard Tris-
tano brings the scene up to the pres-
ent in “What’s Wrong with Chicago
Jazz Today.”

Sidelights on Footlights

In attempting to come to any conclusion on the merits of the
experimental theatre group’s production, two weeks ago, this re-
viewer finds herself in a peculiarly subjective position. It would,
therefore, be advantageous to quote passages from a letter received
last week, giving a few major criticisms.

The gentleman says “I will not
venture to speculate too much on the
hidden merits of Noel Coward’s one
act play, “The Astonished Heart,”
which was produced by the new ex-
perimental group. That it was suc-
cessful, the students should know
from the outset. . . The acting in gen-
eral, showed an inspired understand-
ing of a careless pattern. The con-
versation between Barbara and Leo-
nora in the second scene was the
weakest in the play. It should have
been performed in a gradually rising
tempo of voices and movements. Much
as I liked Chris’ jumping out of the
window, the logic and emotions were
poorly developed ... On the other
hand, the talk between Barbara and
Chris was a beautiful achievement,
and Leonora and Chris in the fifth
scene were very effective in their
highly unconventional and powerful
acting.”

The performance, in short, was not
so good that the participants need
do no more work, nor was it so medi-
ocre that they need be ashamed. As
is to be expected, if the “Astonished

Coach Ned Merriam and his boys go up against a slightly
more equal foe next Saturday as they meet Wayne University at
the Fieldhouse. The past weekend’s action against Minnesota,
Purdue, Northwestern and Wisconsin resulted in Minnesota’s win-
ning the meet, the Badgers placing and Northwestern, plus Purdue
and Chicago taking the roles of also rans. A mutual agreement
with the various coaches before the meet allowed Chicago to run
in all events but its points were not to be allowed. The agreement
had little or no meaning as the inexperienced Maroons failed to
place.

Saturday’^, contest with Wayne,
while lacking in big names, should re-
sult in a more interesting meet, basing
possible results on the size of Wayne
and the caliber of Chicago. Merriam’s
entries against the other Big Ten
schools, who competed against older
and much more experienced perform-
ers, turned in some fairly creditable
times and distances considering the
earliness of the meet in regard to the
indoor season.

Good Time in 440

Hank Altpeter, Northwestern’s
mainstay, ran a good quarter in the
low fifties, the winning broad jump
came close to 21 feet, a Minnesota
man cleared the high jump bar at 6
feet four inches and there were several
other events in which the Maroons
were sadly outclassed.

There is a good chance that this
will not be the case against the
Waynemen who are reported to be, as
a squad, on much the same footing as
the University thinclads.

Time In

After last Saturday’s track
meet, we heard that familiar Chi-
cago wail, “Oh, we lost again.
What’s the use?” To those who
have a real interest in athletics,
nothing makes them madder.
There are several varied and
good reasons for Chicago’s sub-
par showing in sports. We’ll
only mention one and to us this
is the main reason: according to
the Chicago plan, students get
their degrees after two years of
college, they are then finished
with University sports, but this
is not the case with other Big
Ten schools who have men in
their junior and senior years who
are 20 to 23. It stands to reason
then that the added experience
of 2, 3 or even 5 years will make
a big difference in athletic com-
petition.

* * *

An added word on the above: give
Bokman, Horton, Russell or Fried-
lander another couple of years. Then
see how they would stack up against
big time competition. Next case!

* * *

It seems that we’ve neglected the
rifle team.. .the young gunmen are in
the throes of a winning streak which
is nearing a dozen right now. More
recruits are needed and wanted.
That’s another (the squash teams are
winning too) squad you can get on
which is doing all right for Chicago.

* * *

Our weekly word on baseball: Now
is the time, if every man on campus
who can play will help, for Chicago
to really get going again on the win-
ning Big Ten path. If Kyle Anderson
is given enough encouragement, he
may see his way clear to schedule
conference games. The boys and Kyle
met last night and another meeting
is in the offing; so to use a familiar
expression, “Let’s go!”

Fencer* Compete

Nineteen fencers were brought to-
gether on the Bartlett mats for the
Sunday meet in which a very agile
Mr. Lee Winters, alumnus of the U.
of C. and second man on the 1936
foil team, won top honors. Winter
fenced twelve bouts to triumph final-
ly over Max Gelman of University of
Illinois fame.

Six final contestants made up the
pool from which were eliminated one
by one: J. Blaut of the college, R.
Podlisak from the Lake Shore Ath-
letic Club, and B. Wiley and E. Sul-
livan of Senn High.

The older and more experienced
men showed the knowledge of values
gained from thinking each position
through before parrying or attacking.
