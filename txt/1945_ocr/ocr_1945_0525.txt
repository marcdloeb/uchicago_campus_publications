Fifty-One Professors Are Named
To Council; Will Advise Hutchins

Fifty-one members were elected this week to the Council of
the University Senate, top faculty ruling body, under the sweeping
revisions in University administration enacted last month by the
Board of Trustees.

Under the new Statutes adopted in a special meeting April 30,
the Senate of the University will be composed of all full and asso-
ciate professors, all assistant professors who have been at Chicago
for at least three years, the president, the vice presidents, and the
dean of the faculties. This will enlarge the body from its former
195 to over 450.

Replacing the Senate as highest academic ruling body will be
the new Council, which will have the power to act for the faculty

in deciding all matters of general ed-
ucational policy. President Hutchins
and the Council will exercise veto
power over each other’s actions in this
realm. In case of a deadlock, the
matter will be referred to the Board
of Trustees for final decision.

First business of the new Council,
which is scheduled to meet soon, is

Here's Method
By Which U. C.
Elects Senate

The Hare electoral system, by
which members of the Council of the
University Senate are elected, is a
method for representing all shades of
opinion in proportion to their real
strength, and is consequently known
as Proportional Representation. It is
designed to correct such situations as
occurred in a recent Indiana congres-
sional election, in which 290,000 Dem-
ocratic votes elected all 13 represen-
tatives, while 165,000 Republican
votes and 125,000 Progressive votes
elected no congressmen.

Nominations are made by petition
of a stipulated number of voters. In
the case of the Senate, the required
number is three senators.

When the complete list of nominees

the election of a seven-man executive
Committee, which will have regular
meetings with President Hutchins ev-
ery two weeks from September to
June, to discuss all matters falling
within the jurisdiction of the Coun-
cil. The Committee will have the re-
sponsibility of reporting to the Coun-
cil its recommendations on all pros-
pective measures before Council ac-
tion is taken.

In the future, the Council will meet
once a month, from September to
June, as well as when called to spe-
cial session by the President or by a
fixed number of its members, yet to
be decided. The full 450-man Senate
will regularly meet only once a year,
to hear a report on the University
from the President.

Members of the Council, of which
the President and three other admin-
istrative officers drawn from the vice-
presidents and dean of faculties are
ex officio members, are elected by the
Senate at large by the Hare Sys-
tem of Proportional Representation.
Members of the seven-man Commit-
tee are also elected by the Council un-
der this system.

In the election just completed, 351
members of the Senate voted for 263
nominees to the Council. Of the 51
elected, all but 6 were full professors,

Blueprints for a $1,500,000 faculty housing project, first peg
in a giant postwar expansion program here, have been drafted
by the Administration and will be presented to the Board of
Trustees for approval, Vice-president Wilbur C. Munnecke dis-
closed yesterday.

Construction, if santioned by the Board, will probably begin
next fall, and when completed the project will house at least 150
faculty members and their families, according to official estimates.

Preliminary plans outline the construction of three apart-
ment buildings, thirty-two group-houses, and a building combin-
ing garage facilities and studio apartments. The project, which
will embrace an entire city block, will be erected on the block
bounded by the Midway, 61st Street, Ellis Avenue and Ingleside
Avenue, across the street from Burton-Judson Courts, the men’s
dormitories.

Munnecke revealed that construction of new student dor-
mitories is also now under consideration, although no Board
action on such developments has yet been taken.

University authorities hope that the Board will sanction the
program by July, and that construction can begin early in the fall.
University business experts predict easing of wartime building
restrictions by that time. Construction should be completed
within a year after ground is broken and buildings now standing

are razed.

Plans Still Incomplete

Working drawings must still be
completed, officials pointed out, and
they also noted that detailed cost
estimates have not yet been approved
nor financial negotations concluded.

The units will number 75 elevator
apartments, 32 houses, and 40 studio
apartments, according to the present
charts. The elevator apartment
buildings wll be in simple modem
style, in contrast to the Gothic archi-
tecture of the Quadrangles. The
group-houses will be built along
Georgian lines if architectural de-
signs completed by Philip B. Maher
of Chcagio are accepted. Maher has
already sketched tentatve floor plans
of the individual units, as well as
the exterior features.

Munnecke indicated that the project
will be expected to pay for itself,
although the University does not in-
tend it as a profit making enterprise.
Actual rents cannot be computed un-
til bids are let and accepted.

The central apartment building will
probably be 14 stories high with the
flanking buildings facing the Midway
twelve stories each. (Picture shown
above has been somewhat expanded.)
Two apartments will be constructed
on each floor with apartments in the
two smaller buildings of 6 rooms and

those in the central one of five rooms.
Each apartment will have north and
south exposure and in addition either
west or east exposure. Five-room
apartments will have two bedrooms,
living room, dining room, kitchen, and
bath; six-room apartments will be
identical except for an additional bed-
room and bath.

old Senate, led by Professor Leonard
D. White, have been studying the
problem. Its significance was given
added weight by last year’s contro-
versy between President Hutchins and
the Senate. At that time, the Senate
sent a Memorial to the Board asking
assurances that the President would
not be allowed to take any action on
general educational policy without
faculty consent.

The board responded by expressing
its confidence in President Hutchins,
but suggesting a reorganization
which would democratize the Senate
by including associate and assistant
professors, and which would facilitate
communication between president and
faculty by the establishment of a
small executive committee which
would meet with President Hutchins
frequently.

Hutchins' New Plans For
University Will Be Aired

By ALAN J. STRAUSS

Prospects that President Hutchins will make a number of
concrete reform proposals next year gives the Council of the Uni-
versity Senate elected this week the most crucial importance.
With the College well established, indications are that the presi-
dent will bring up for faculty action recommendations he has

already made informally for revisions in divisional curriculum.

The end of the war will definitely

bring a review of the decision made
some time ago to retain the B.S.
degree in the biological and physical
sciences for the duration. President
Hutchins has proposed the substitu-
tion of a three-year Master’s program,
similar to that already adopted in
the humanities and social sciences.

Among the other suggestions the
president has offered in various ad-
dresses are proposals to abolish the
credit system and the course system
in the divisions, with the substition
of divisional lectures, reading lists,
the tutorial system, and general exam-
inations. He has also proposed the
establishment of separate Ph.D. pro-
grams for teachers and for research
men.

The newly-elected Council, as high-
est academic ruling body of the Uni-
versity, holds veto power over all
actions of President Hutchins in the
sphere of general education policy,
and could thus prevent the adoption
of such proposals, unless overruled
by the Board of Trustees. On the
other hand, it might cooperate with
the president in approving them or
in drawing up some acceptable com-
promise.

Under these conditions, there exists
the temptation to analyze the member-
ship of the new Council exclusively
in terms of “pro-Hutchins” and “anti-
Hutchins” men, roughly on the lines
of last year’s faculty-Hutchins con-
troversy. It should be emphasized
that that fight is over, and that those
lines do not necessarily hold now.
Wi;h the fundamental organization of
the University no longer in question,
consideration will be directed instead
to the specific measures under dis-
cussion.

Analysis of the election results in-
dicates that a desire for each faculty
group for representation, rather than
a desire to support or oppose Hutch-
ins, motivated most voting. This re-

suited, in general, in political maneu-
vering within each group, rather than
on a University-wide basis. There
was little voting for candidates out-
side a senator’s own school or divi-
sion, or even department.

In the Social Service Administra-
tion School, for example, returns in-
dicate that the faculty members eli-
gble to vote held a caucus and de-
cided to cast all their votes for the
dean of the school, Helen Wright.
This resulted in Miss Wright’s elec-
tion for a full three-year term, thus
insuiing representation for the school
for that period.

Most obvious evidence of Univer-
sity-wide campaigning occurred in
the Law School and the Zoology and
Botany Departments. Three pro
fessors from the Law School were
elected to the council, two for three-
year terms, although a representa-
tion of slightly less than two was
indicated by the size of the Law
School faculty. Since two of the
three elected are known Hutchins op-
ponents, it may be assumed that they
received support from the University-
wide Crane-Craven-Viner-Knght con-
servative faction.

Zoology sent three members to
the Council, although faculty
members in that department vot-
ing together could have elected only
one representative without outside
support. Botany sent two representa-
tives, although only one would be
indicated by the department’s voting
strength.

Of more importance than how the
members of the Council were elected
is how they will vote on measures pro-
posed by President Hutchins. Hut-
chins supporters divide the Council
membership into “reasonable” and
“unreasonable” delegates, rather than
“pro-Hutchins” and “anti-Hutchins;”
although “unreasonable” and “anti
Hutchins” seem to be roughly
similar, since they define an unreason-
able member as one who judges is-
sues in terms of his antipathy toward
the president, rather than on the
merits of the measures involved. Esti-
mates made in these quarters on this
basis indicate that on most major is-
sues Hutchins will have somewhere
from a slight majority to considerably
less than half the votes necessary for
passage.

Hutchins opponents, on the other
hand, refuse to make predictions as
to the general complexion of the Coun-
cil. They assert that predictions could
be made only in terms of specific
issues, when details of these are re-
vealed. They do state that they hope
past controversies will be forgotten,
and that new issues will be judged
solely on their own merits.

The best unbiased estimate of Hut-
chins strength in the Council, taking
all factors into consideration, would
seem to indicate that neither liberal
nor conservative faction will muster
strength of landslide proportions, but
that the conservatives will have a

slight edge.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

—————“———-^————— Page Three

Netmen In Big 10 Tourney Dark Horse Role

Maroons Drop
Windup Joust

The University of Chicago’s varsity
tennis stock plummeted this week as
the team dropped its first match in
I eight starts, 8-0, to a surprising Pur-
due squad at Lafayette last Saturday.

The loss to Purdue dimmed the
hopes of Maroon fans who expected
Chicago to make a fight for the top
position in the Conference title meet
this weekend at Evanston. However,
with a few breaks in the drawing of
opponents, the Maroons’ tournament
“dark horse,” may yet come up with
a second or third place. Michigan
and Ohio State are prohibitive favor-
ites to battle it out again as they did
last year before the Wolverines final-
ly gained an 18-17 triumph. The
tournament starts today.

Notable in the downfall was the
defeat of Harry Tully, number two
man, who dropped his first singles
contest since the season started. .Tul-
ly went down 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 before
Kalkofen of the Boilermakers, while
team-mate Phil Glotzer put up a stiff
fight in losing to Lum of Purdue 8-6,
6-4 in the number one play.

Dick Shapiro fell before Matisse
6-3, 6-4 to drop his third match in
eight starts. It looked as if Norm
Greenberg, playing number four, was
going to salvage a victory for the
Maroons when he was leading Linn
4-1 in the third set but apparently
Norm forgot he was winning because
he dropped five straight games to
lose 3-6, 6-4, 6—4.

Another Chicago victory might
have been possible in the third doubles
contest as Mathews and Grayston
were tied 9-9 in the second set with
Taylor and Jaeckel of Purdue after
dropping the first set 6-2. However,
this match was suspended so that
the Maroon squad could catch their
train back to Chicago.

Method..,

(Continued from page one)
is ompiled, each voter may vote for
as many as he wishes, but he must
deugnate his first choice, second
choice, and so on.

First step in determining the suc-
< mful candidates is the fixing of the
quuta of votes necessary for election.
In the election just held, the quota
wu 7. This figure is computed from
th^ number of votes cast and the
number to be elected by a standard
formula.

When the ballots are received by
the election officials, they are divided
according to the voters’ first choices.
All candidates with the necessary
quota of votes are declared elected.
If any candidates have more than the
quota, the excess ballots are then
divided among the voters’ second
choices. If, after these surpluses are
distributed, there are still vacancies
on the Council because not enough
candidates have the necessary quota,
then the ballots of those candidates
having the least number of votes are
distributed among the alternate
choices, until enough candidates do
have the quota.

2 UC Trackmen In Big Ten Meet

The U. of C. thinclads closed their track schedule Saturday running
against a triumphant Wayne University Team which scored an 84*47 victory.
The high scoring leader of Wayne U., Lorenzo Wright, made 26 points. He
left for the Army Wednesday, finishing his track record in good style by win*
ning five firsts.

The Stagg Field running and field events got underway with John Bok-
man winning the mile, tying for first in both the high jump and pole vault,
and placing second in the half-mile. Rust scored in the 220’s.

Merriam plans to have John Bokman and possibly Al Dinckleocker rep-
resent the Maroon interests in the Conference at Champaign on May 26.

College Net Team
Tournament Host

Fresh from a victory over Morgan
Park Military Academy, 3-1, and
their fifth straight win of an unde-
feated season, the College tennis team
will play host to the Private School
League tournament Saturday morn-
ing at 10.

In the Morgan Park meet Wednes-
day, the courtmen’s number one man,
Dave Hocker, was defeated 7-5, 6-2,
but Larry Olen and Dick Atkinson re-
captured the lead by wins of 10-8,
6-2, and 6-0, 6-2. The meet was
capped with a victory by Harry Ald-
ridge and Alex Pope in the doubles

Editorial

Onward Chicago!

To students of the University, faculty-ad-
ministration pyrotechnics have always be-
longed in the realm of the never-never land.
While the disputes involved educational issues
of paramount importance, the prolonged dis-
cussions have appeared far too remote and
technical to interest the cursory observer. Such
certainly was the case a year ago when the
faculty-administration clash created a nation-
wide educational furor, but stirred little fan-
fare on the Quadrangles. Such is again the
case with the reorganization of the University
senate and the election of its new council.

It should go without saying that such con-
troversial issues as the reorganization of the
divisions, with the establishment of a dual
Ph.D. degree for research and teachings and
abolition of the B.S. degree, are matters of im-
port to every member of the University com-
munity. For it is precisely the University’s
attitude with regard to such problems that de-
termines its stature in the educational world.

--------------- THE CHICAGO MAROON
setting personalities above issues. The well
being of this University for years to come is
at stake, and it is incumbent upon all concerned
to spare no effort in establishing the most
cordial and mutually advantageous relations
possible.

The faculty must beware of placing its
own interests above those of the University as
a whole. The preident must refrain from
arbitrary action. The Board should adopt a
“hands off” policy except in the event of a hope-
less deadlock. The students must achieve an
intelligent understanding of the problems at
hand.

Only through such integration of all four
groups can the University assume its rightful
position in the academic sun.	.

Wanted: Student Opinion

University of Chicago students are notori-
ous for their unhesitant denunciation of high-
handed authoritarian tactics, pedagogical and
otherwise. But paradoxically enough they are
as silent as the proverbial tomb on issues of

Innuendoes by Armstrong

The entire University—the Board of Trus-
tees, the administration, the faculty, and the
students—are all directly concerned with the
senate reorganization and the council election.
It should be explained that the senate, acting
through its council, is an organization of Uni-
versity faculty members established to discuss
and to settle questions of academic significance.
The administration assumes the responsibility
for the successful operation of the University,
and the Board is the supreme authority of the
institution. It is for the students that the Uni-
versity is operated, and any action taken must
thus directly affect them.

Briefly, the reorganization of the senate is
designed.to facilitate communication between
the faculty and the tdministration. It is hoped
that both will assume the tremendous responsi-
bility and burden which is jointly theirs. In
the event of a stalemate, the Trustees will
arbitrate the decision, but Board action is
highly undesirable in most cases, since it in-
volves interference in academic problems by
businessmen who are not professionals in the
field.

In the past, both the president and the
faculty have appeared guilty of aloofness, of
refusal to discuss the questions at hand, and of

direct importance to them.

Such is the case with the invitation made
last week by the Dean of Students for sugges-
tions in regard to construction of new dormi-
tories and remodeling of the Reynolds Club.
While the popular hue and cry has been for
more student housing facilities and for a luxur-
iously equipped union building, there are few
if any who have given the proposals the serious
consideration which they merit. The sugges-
tion hopper in the Dean’s Office is still barren.

There are innumerable questions to be
solived. Should the new dormitories be single
units with central dining and recreation facili-
ties ? Should they be patterened after the Bur-
ton-Judson plan or the Harvard single-house
scheme? Should the Reynold’s club be limited
to the upper two years and the divisions? Or
should it be so solely for men or open to all
students?

This is more than a “write your congress-
man” proposition. It is a question of intelli-
gent participation in areas of activity of the
University which are of direct and important
concern to every student. It is a responsibility
as well as an opportunity, and it should be ac-
cepted as such.

University not taking part in those
enterprises.

The interior of the court will be
completely landscaped and planted,
with a common garden or lawn four
hundred feet long and between one
hundred twenty and one hundred fifty
feet wide, in addition to individual
gardens for house holders.

After approving the project, the
Board of Trustees must also decide
whether financing will be undertaken
from University funds or by means
of outside investors. If the latter
step is desired by the Board, Vice-
president Munnecke feels confident
that the necessary capital will be
available from New York insurance
companies, whom he contacted when
there last week. Although negotia-
tions are not yet complete, three com-
panies are specifically interested in
the project.

The history of the new housing
group goes back to November of last
year, when the Board of Trustees ap-
propriated funds for architectural
studies. A faculty committee com-
posed of Professors Bay, Babcock, Ir-
win, Johnson, and Olmsted was ap-
pointed to consult with the Admin-
istration, and questionnaires were
sent out to the faculty to determine
their preferences for accommodations.

Good transportation will be assured
since the present streetcar lines on
61st Street will be replaced by a
motorbus line next year.

Housing.,.

(Continued from page one)

All three apartment buildings will
have both passenger and service ele-
vators.

Group Houses Are Described

Group houses will be arranged in
two rows, one on Ellis and one on
Ingleside Avenue. Each row will con-
sist of three separate buildings, the
center one divided into eight seven-
room houses, each of the two side
buildings into four six-room houses.
Six-room houses will be on two floors,
seven-room dwellings on three. Each
house will have a full basement and
individual garden, approximately 50
by 25 feet, separated from neighbor-
ing residences by hedge rows. All
entrances will be from the street.

The building which will front 61st
Street will be three stories in height,
with basement and ground floor used
for garage facilities and second and
third floor devoted to about 40 two-
room studio apartments. These will be
a combination living-dining-sleeping
room twenty-three feet long. Occu-
pants of these apartments will share
a terrace on the roof of the garage.

According to present plans, the en-
tire group of residences will be heated
by means of the University steam
lines, thus making more basement
space available to those who rent
houses.

Store facilities will probably be
rented tn private merchants, with the

Letters to Editor

Chicago Settlement Attacked
For Obstructing ‘Democracy’

To the Editor:

It is ironic that we of this great university, committed in
principal to enquiry, evidence, rational appraisal and decision,
and democracy, should drop coins in the charity cans of an organi-
zation whose purpose and activity are unknown to most of us, and
whose work has in some respects fought and obstructed one of
the profoundest democratic movements in our history.

I am referring to the contributions made last week, on Der Tag Days,
to the University of Chicago Settlement, and solicited by the club women
and fraternity men of the University to the tune of over $200.

The profound democratic movement is the Back of the Yards Council,
part of a larger organization called the Industrial Areas Foundation, which
has been opposed from the beginning by our Settlement in the stockyards
district. It is profound because it is of the people, by the people, and for
the people, in a very literal sense.

But I could present you only fragmentary and third-hand evidence, and
the least I could do in the way of academic consistency would be to appeal to
my fellow students, my teachers and administrators, to go to more primary
sources of evidence. I raise the question that all the evidence is not in,
and I suspect that in few cases was our charity last week tempered by facts,
or even qualified by them.

The point of this letter is not to belittle Tag Days, nor to run down
the University Settlement, nor to challenge public charity, nor to question
personalities, nor to pose problems of canons of evidence, nor to state a
philosophy of value and of democracy, nor to make decisions.

The point is to comment on the relation of our professions to a very
specific practice.

—H.P.

Dean, B & G Hit for ODP Failures

To the Editor,

In last Friday’s Maroon, Miss Stearns—“Sidelights on Footlights”—
gazed with envy at the dramatics office of U.C.L.A., expressing a doubt that
our own office of Dramatic Productions has made any attempts to raise it-
self to the high level achieved by U.C.L.A. She also proposed a number of
future steps for ODP to follow.

The most reasonable of these steps would be the closer relations with an
already friendly University Orchestra and the radio presentation of dramatic
sketches. However, there are two stumbling blocks which any dramatic
group on campus will soon come face to face with—on the U. of C. campus,
at least: the Dean of Students office and the Department of Buildings and
Grounds. Due to the latter organization, all plays are limited to one set each
—the days of “Green Grow the Lilacs” and “Arms and the Man” being
long since past. This ruling would also eliminate most musical or student
productions. These sets must be constructed and painted in the Service build-
ing, two blocks away from Mandel Hall. The working area in this building
(allotted to ODP) is slightly over ten by fifteen feet, eliminating any possi-
bility of constructing the elaborate sets invariably required for any play
above the level of “high school theatre”.

The Dean of Students office is included as a “stumbling block” because
all ODP activities must look to this office for financial support. Former Ma-
roon editor Gottesman was not wrong in stating that ODP’s allotment for
the current year was one thousand, six hundred and fifty dollars; however, he
neglected to state that the wages of the director and secretary, plus the cost
of stationery and office supplies, consumes this amount—almost to the dollar.

If Miss Stearns looks forward to a bigger and better dramatics office, she
may feel free to suggest the method of performing the miracle required.

Sincerely,

Alan Boulton

Geology Expert Mapped Enemy
Coastlines Without Photo Aids

For his work in preparing amphi-
bious landings on unfamiliar Japanese
islands, William C. Krumbein, As-
istant Professor of Geology now on
leave from the University for govern-
ment service, has received the Meri-
torious Civilian Service award of the
War Department.

The citation came from Secretary
of War Henry L. Stimson for “leader-
ship, indefatigable energy and sound
judgment in the succesful accomplish-
ment of the confidential strategic
studies of foreign coastlines which
have proven important to the war
effort.”

Working with Martin A. Mason, an
engineer on the Beach Erosion Board
of the Office of Chief of Engineers,
Krumbein has developed techniques
making it possible to predict with
great accuracy the natural features
of any enemy-held beach without even
a picture of the beach available.

Orders from the War Department
often came in this form, “Select a
beach on this island for us to land
a major assault force on.”

A very reliable observer notes an interesting misprint in Critic’s adver-

tise in the near future. “If this contract is cancelled or if advertiser fails
to use the full amount of his contract, then advertiser fails to be made good
by additional publication before that amount.” This same observer also
points out that the contract asserts that “The Critic... has long stood at the
head of the long list of collegiate publications as the recognized medium of
a market esteemed by advertisers both local and national.” Maturity comes
swiftly hereabouts.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Friday, May 25, 194*

with the CUM NMI

Pretty girl with an unusual name is our

beauty-of-the-week Bamby Golden . . . Quadrangler, Billings'*

Hospital worker, member of the Student Publicity

Board. Isn't she charming?

And isn’t the two-piece seersucker dress she’s wearing a
perfect match for her charm? It’s as fresh and young
and as ’’different” as her name... three reasons why Bamhy
loved it so when she saw it in the Young Chicago Shop
at Marshall Field & Company . . . three reasons why we
think you’d like it, too . . . particularly for the
warm days that always come at the end of
the spring quarter.

The data? Here it is! Colors ... brown, red, green or
blue striped in white. Sizes ... 9 to 15. Price ... a
mighty moderate $12.95! And you look for it in
the shop that specializes in campus-perfect costumes
. . • the Young Chicago Shop—Sixth Floor, South,
State at Marshall Field & Company.

Meet the Beet People. Every week, on this page,
the Chicago Maroon will introduce you to another
University of Chicago glamor girl... a winning campus
personality. And every week you’ll see her in an
attractive costume she’s chosen at Marshall Field & Company.
