As An Artist Sees It...

Flash Green Light To
U. C. Student Council;

Commuters Will Meet

At a meeting of dormitory delegates held Wednesday evening
in Burton Lounge, endorsement of the principle of student govern-
ment was passed by an overwhelming majority. The endorsement
took the form of a motion adopting the aims of such an organigation
embodied in a paper by Burton Rosner and Norman Kurland, resi-
dents of Burton Court. After a subsequent discussion of ways and
means in relation to these aims, a committee was appointed to
collect various plans for student organization for presentation to
the full committee next Wednesday.

Petersberg dandy on vacation, is mis-
taken by the good citizens of a small
town for the Inspector General, come
to put their municipal house in order.

The experimental theatre group,
which presented its first play, “The
Astonished Heart”, has made plans
for future productions. On February
16, “Prometheus Bound” will be giv-
en, under the direction of Robert Car-
ter, and early in March two puppet
plays by Krymborg will be presented.
Casting for the Greek play has not
yet been completed, so interested stu-
dents should see Mr. Carter at 3:15
on Monday, in Lexington 7.

Student Fund
Drive Begins;
Quota $2500

Climaxing a month of pre-drive
activity, the Committee of the
World Student Service Fund
Drive, headed by Ruth Greenlee
and Laurel Childe, will launch
a two week program designed
to reach the campus quota of
$2500.

Principal speaker at the campaign
functions sponsored by various cam-
pus organizations, will be Miss Lola
Mayer, travelling secretary of the
WSSF. On Sunday, she will speak
at International House at their
weekly Sunday Soiree, on “A Bird’s
Eye View of Students in the World;”
later the same day, she will speak be-
fore the Baptist Student Group and
at Chapel House.

On Monday at 3:30, Miss Mayer
will preside at a meeting for workers
and solicitors of the drive; she will
speak before the Chapel staff at 4:30;
the dormitories at 6:00; and at a
meeting to which the clubs and fra-

A further development in the sit-
uation was the calling of a mass
meeting for all commuters, to be held
Friday, February 16, at 3:30 p.m.,
probably in Mandel Hall. The group
calling the meeting is led by chairman
William Sparks, a commuter in the
fourth year of the College. Its pri-
mary aim, according to Sparks, is to
determine whether the majority of
commuters will favor the principle of
student government. If the majority
approve, the next step will be to arrive
at a method for choosing commuter-
delegates to confer, on an equal basis
with the dormitory committee already
established.

The chief aim of a student organ-
ization proposed by Rosner and Kur-
land, and adopted by the dormitory
delegates, is the encouragement of
communication between different
groups of students and between fac-
ulty and students. Aims specifically
renounced were 1) coercive power over
individual students; 2) the regulation
of hours or similar rules; and 3) the
regulation of the activities of groups
not affecting the entire student body.

76 At Harper’s

University Sweats Despite
Nationwide Coal Crackdown

The mercury bubbled and the ther-
mostasts rested on a comfortably high
niche on the Quadrangles Thursday,
thought officially the nationwide coal
though officially the nationwide coal
James Byrnes, had been put into
effect.

Old-fashioned foot stoves continued
to gather dust and extra sweaters and
blankets stayed in camphor for the
temperature throughout the campus
was normal and in some spots was
stifling. Readings taken by staff re-
porters with The Chicago Maroon re-
vealed that it was 76 in Harper’s
library and 74 in President Hutchins’
office, despite the ruling slashing tem-
peratures to 68.

Chicago athletes won’t go into

Mass Meeting
Set By Forum
Next Tuesday

A meeting for the discussion of
student government has been sched-
uled by Student Forum for Tuesday,
Feb. 6, at 7:30 p.m., in Rosenwald
Hall, Room 2. All students, whether
commuters or dormitory residents,
and at all levels in the University,
are invited to attend and participate.
Although dormitory representatives
have already endorsed the principle
of student organization, no expres-
sion on the matter has been given by
any large number of commuters. The
meeting will make it possible for
commuters to discuss their view with
one another and with dormitory stu-
dents.

Before general discussion begins,
one student representing the advo-
cates of such an organization and one
representing the opposition will pre-
sent the pros and cons of the subject.
Dale Stucky, Forum director, has
stated that although a number of
tentative speakers in favor are avail-
able, he has not yet contacted any will-
ing to present the opposition’s views.
Any student interested in doing so
should inform Stucky immediately.

an emphatic announcement that there
will be no track shutdown because
of the coal shortage. Other Big Ten
conference schools have expressed
fear that they may be compelled to
padlock their gymnasiums, but none
have yet progressed beoynd the news-
paper quote stage.

Byrnes in his order urged that coal
production be chanelled from civilian
use into war production.

New Students
Open Classes

By Pat Kindahi

Thursday marked the beginning of
classes for approximately 150 stu-
dents entering the College at mid-
year. The new arrivals have been on
campus since Monday, taking part in
an orientation program, designed to
introduce them to the University.

Under the direction of Norman F.
Maclean, dean of students in the Col-
lege, the Student Orientation Board
planned several social activities to
enliven the routine of tests and regis-
tration.

The first meeting of the new stu-
dents on Monday morning included
various addresses of welcome. This
was followed by two days of place-
ment tests, a duty for most, but to at
least one young hopeful actually
“fun”.

Receptions in the dormitories Mon-
day night gave the new students a
chance to meet the official heads and
student leaders of the residence halls.
Jeans and flannel shirts came out of

Unique Ration

System Mapped

By Book Store

Ration by rotation!

A unique rationing, conceived, nur-
tured and now being carried out by
the University Book Store seems to
be solving the cigarette shortage for
60 happy people each day.

The mechanics of the plan operate
on a “patience rewardeth” basis. Each
day 60 numbered cards are distribut-
ed at 12:30. The next day, these
cards are redeemable for a package
of cigarettes. Thus, an hour’s fruit-
less wait is avoided, with the cigar-
ettes distributed more evenly.

The system, originated earlier in
the week, appears to function smooth-
ly and has been received with a great
deal of enthusiasm from the cigar-
ette smoking portion of the campus.

Huge Crowd Flocks to Hear
Debate on Peace Time Draft

By Joan Kohn

Compulsory military training in
peacetime, one of the most hotly de-
bated questions of the year, was raked
over the coals again last Friday eve-
ning at the discussion sponsored by
Labor Rights Society. The question
was debated by Wilbur C. Munnecke,
vice-president of the University and
Milton Mayer of the Administrative
Offices with professor Mortimer J.
Adler acting as moderator.

Munnecke took the floor first, on
behalf of compulsory training, justify-
ing it on the basis of military neces-
sity. Doubt of this necessity was ex-
pressed by Mayer, who concluded that
since the Allies are going to crush
Germany and Japan we would be open
to attack only from the “peace loving
nations”. Another source of disagree-
ment occured over the size of the
peacetime forces.

Arguments favoring conscription as
a means of bettering health and ed-
ucation were discarded immediately by
Munnecke. Mayer pointed out, how-

ever, that these same arguments have
been advanced by government author-
ities as reasons for supporting the
proposal. He proposed that an inter-
national organization with the power
to outlaw war from the world would
be far more effective in maintaining
peace than military forces.

Originally scheduled to take place
in the Oriental Institute, the debate
drew /such large numbers of people
that it was necessary to switch the
meeting to Kent Laboratory. Even
Kent was not large enough to accom-
odate the crowds which overflowed
into the aisles.

Ruth Draper
Acts Tonight

Ruth Draper, monologist, whose re-
nowned character sketches have won
esteem the world round, will present
a series of solo-dramas tonight in
Mandel Hall. She will appear under
the auspices of the University of Chi-
cago Settlement at its annual benefit.

Miss Draper has been lauded for
two decades for her three-dimensional
character portrayals, which, with the
aid of bits of costumary, have enabled
her to project the most stirring dra-
matic moments of many levels of so-
ciety in a single brief sketch. Espe-
cially noted are her “On a Porch in
Maine” and “Three Women and Mr.
Clicord.” A small suitcase of as-
sorted shawls, hats and coats consti-
tute the entirety of her props, but
are sufficient fon vivid projections of
one hundred and fifty characters in
some two dozen sketches. Miss
Draper has also made appearances
with her dancer nephew, Paul Draper.

Canteen Sponsors
Parties on Campus

Since the closing of the Midway
USO at 975 E. 60th, the USO group
has been sponsoring functions at Ida
Noyes Hall every Sunday from three
to nine p.m.

Each week a program of dancing,
games, and contests is featured for
all servicemen and women and the
junior hostesses of the USO. A five-
piece orchestra furnishes the music
for the dancing. In addition to this
program, punch and cookies are
served throughout the afternoon and
are supplemented by a light buffet
supper at six.

The informal Sunday parties are
being continued indefinitely, not only
for the military groups stationed on
the University campus, but for serv-
ice personnel from other parts of the
city.

In celebration of its fiftieth anni-

Anna Nichols, make-up editor.
Other aspiring young journalists from
the hall complete the staff. The bi-
weekly paper wil relay any current
news of interest to the girls along
with other amusing and timely sub-
jects. In this attempt to promote
unity and harmony among the girls
the paper is to be utterly void of
any malicious gossip.

Where Are The Commuters?

Last Wednesday’s meeting of the all-dormitory committee
for student organization made impressive progress in one sense,
and in another it reached an impasse. After an endorsement of
the formal ends of student government, the committee spent the
balance of the evening deliberating on possible means to imple-
ment these generally accepted ends. When no tangible agreement
was reached a motion was made and carried to appoint a fact-
finding sub-committee for the express purpose of collecting and
studying various plans of establishing a student council. It is
expected that students from all parts of the campus will submit
plans for consideration by this committee.

Planning Committee Named

The establishment of a committee to study plans of student
government represents progress, but, unfortunately, one fact
seems to have escaped the dormitory group: the commuting stu-
dents on campus have yet to be included as a body in the considera-
tions of the dormitory committee. This fact makes all progress
to date limited, and any failure to recognize and adjust to this
fact in the future will make further progress impossible.

Commuters Overlooked

The large mass of commuters must not only be given the
opportunity to ratify or reject any particular plan formulated by
the all-dormitory committee ; they must also be allowed to par-
ticipate on a basis of full equality in all deliberations prior to the
proposal of any given plan. Until the commuters share in such
future deliberations, any attempt to characterize the student
council which will evolve from these group meetings as truly
representative and democratic will be futile. Commuters make up
a full fifty per cent of the campus, and they must be permitted to
offer their opinions, not only as individuals, but as a group as well.

Full Endorsement Needed

There are, however, certain practical problems which must
be considered and overcome before equal commuter representation
can be achieved. For one thing, no expression of endorsement of
the principle of student council has yet been received from the
day students as a body. This endorsement is essential if those
students .who are at all interested ever expect to see such a
council exist as an instrument of common good on this campus.
Furthermore, some mechanism must be established so that a
representative commuter committee can be democratically elected
to serve in the same capacity as the present dormitory committee.
Both problem must be overcome as soon as possible so that the
commuters will he placed on a basis of equality with the dormitory
residents. Once this is done, the way will be clear for further
progress towards our common goal—a democratic, all-campus
student council.

All-Commuter Meeting

' The means to this immediate end are being provided by a
small group of commuting students who are sponsoring an all-
commuter mass meeting to be held Friday afternoon, February 16
on campus. Such a meeting can and must solve these two vital
problems. There must be, however, one essential ingredient added
to the efforts of this group. There must be a wholehearted,
universal response by the thousand and more commuting students.
All commuters must join in the meeting, express their opinions,
and assume their definite share of democratic responsibilities.

Representation Vital

Such a meeting will be an opportunity for all students to
participate on a free and equal basis in a matter vital to the
entire University. An overwhelming response will be the com-
muter’s guarantee that he will not be dominated by any narrow
special interest splinter group, and he will receive full considera-
tion on a par with the student who lives on campus. Commuters
must be the forgotten people on campus no longer!

The Albeneri Trio, Alexander
Schneider, violin; Benar Heifetz, vio-
loncello; and Erich Itor Kahn, piano;
presented a very successful chamber
concert in Mandel Hall, Tuesday, Jan-
uary 30. The program included the
Trio No. 5 in E Flat Major by Haydn;
the Trio in A Minor by Ravel; and the
Trio No. 1 in B Flat Major by Schu-
bert.

The Haydn trio, a seldom heard,
very appealing work, was played the
least attractively. Mr. Kahn played
with good technique and musical ex-
pression, but full blending of the
instruments was marred by Mr.
Schneider’s exaggerated “pushing”
and the fact that Mr. Heifetz (who
was evidently bored by a typically
dull Hadyn ’cello part) paid too little
attention to important details of
phrasing and dynamics.

The Ravel trio is a supremely beau-
tiful composition. The first move-
ment, Modere, is one of very warm
expression, which was not quite done

Critic Lauds
Artist’s Work
As Vivid, Alive

My impression of the new show
by Charles Schucker, at the South
Side Community AH Center, is that
he is one of th" most vivid and alive
young painters around town today.

It is an exhibition of watercolors
which give full play to his broad and
vigorous style of painting. Every
picture is full of movement, and there
is a freedom and boldness in his
strokes that makes even the still lifes
lose the static quality that is usually
associated with the form. Animation,
backed by sound draughtsmanship is
particularly well exemplified in a
black and grey study of three nudes,
one of the most impressive in the show.
His colors are primary reds, blues,
and greens, with lots of black, that
match his style in their directness.
His subjects range from landscape
to city scenes, and his figures are
almost caricatures, realistic, without
detail, only their action is stressed.
He is primarily a realist, in spite of
his freedom and a sometime tendency
to simplify almost to the point of ab-
straction.

At first glance, the landscapes ap-
pear decorative and striking; actually
they lack a certain depth. He seems
much happier when doing the street
scenes filled with moving people. Per-
haps this is because he is young, and
in a tremendous hurry to paint all
he can, but he is an artist worth fol-
lowing, one who will go a long way.

Biographically speaking, Schucker,
was born in Maryland and graduated
from the Institute of Fine Arts of
that state. He received the Henry
Walters Traveling Scholarship, which
included a trip to Europe, and is now
on the staff of the Community Center.
The Museum of Modern Art and the
Annual Watercolor Show at the Art
Institute are among the galleries he
has shown at in the past few seasons.
The Community Center at 3831 *S.
Michigan is in itself one of the most
interesting places of its kind in the
city. According to Mr. Gorleigh, the di-
rector, it is the only Negro and White
art center in the world, sponsored by
public funds. The classes are free,
and the staff of artists who teach
them have volunteered their services.
It is certainly one of the more worth
while community enterprises, par-
ticularly if all their shows are of the
caliber of this one.

THE REPUBLICAN’S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES
Chapter XIII

We shall begin the second half of the term by studying the
. leading to the Civil War. The. was highlighted by the tremendous
struggle over slavery. The strugglers may be roughly classified
into two groups:

A. People Who Owned Slaves.

B. People Who Didn’t Own Slaves.

The People Who Owned Slaves lived,
generally, south of the line laid out
by the famous surveyor, Mason Dixon.
These people never did anything ex-
cept, of course, live in the South and
own slaves, such warlike actions that
the People Who Didn’t Own Slaves
were constantly expecting war to
break out.

The People Who Didn’t Own .Slaves
lived, generally, in the North. This
was a region where slaveiy was econ-
omically unprofitable. By a strange
coincidence, the people who lived there
were the Americans most firmly con-
vinced that slavery was an unpardon-
able moral wrong which should be
obliterated immediately. Most out-
spoken of the People Who Didn’t Own
Slaves was Harriet Beecher Stowe
who wrote a well known book based
on her experiences while living in a
town on the north bank of the Ohio
River. There she invented an ingen-
ious method of freeing Kentucky
slaves. She realized how horrible san-
itary conditions were in the South
and began luring slaves into the free
state of Ohio to take baths. She is
therefore known as America’s most
famous abolutionist. The place where
the abolutions took place was euphem-
istically called “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”.
That Mrs. Stowe’s book was one of
the chief causes of the Civil War is
unquestionable. Having brought about
a fratricidal war which killed thou-
sands of American men, disrupted the
economy of a huge portion of the
United States, created the most acute
racial problem America has ever faced,
and left a sectional animosity which
lasted for decades, Mrs. Stowe was
able to retire peacefully to England
to help Lady Byron accuse her hus-
band of immoral conduct.

Other prominent abolutionists of the
time were members of a secret military
organization known as the William
Lloyd* Garrison. The patron saint
of this organization was a martyred
slave named John, about whom they
wrote the famous marching song of
the aboultionists, John’s Brown Body.

semi-rhythmical tapping throughout
the performance, causing a whispered
discussion between the performers af-
ter the first movement. But in the
performance itself it was hard to find
a significant flaw. The tempi, phras-
ing, tone and, in particular, the excel-
lent spicatto in the rondo (last move-
ment) were very highly commendable.

It must be remembered that the
Albeneri group has only been in exist-
ence for several months. Present in-
dications are, however, that with con-
tinued association these artists may
well become the same sort of standard
of excellence in their field as the
Budapest group has become for string
quartets. As such they will be per-
forming a very useful service, as the
form of the piano trio, for which many
beautiful compositions have been writ-
ten, requires the utmost of ensemble
skill to achieve proper balance and
tonal blending of the instruments.

Faculty Gets
Most Smokes!

To the Editor:

We are sending you this letter in
the hope that you will publish it.
We realize that the cigarette shortage
is critical, however, since Ida Noyes
receives a number of cartons per week,
it seems to me that the students are
entitled to a few of the more popular
brands. We have observed many times
that two and three packs are given
to the members of the faculty while
the students do not receive any. Am
1 correct in saying that Ida Noyes is
for the students? If so, I think that
the cigarettes should be evenly dis-
tributed to both students' and faculty.

When soft lights, pleasant surround-

“CASSEROLE”, Seneca Hotel, 200
East Chestnut. It may be a little off
your beaten track, but for the meal
with charm you’ve always wanted,
it’s worth clearing a road for. Three
delightful dining rooms await your
pleasure. One, large and formal; the
second, with hand-painted Chinese
wallpaper, and another, warmer and
more intimate.

As you might imagine, casseroles
are featured, the specialty changing
each day. Other dishes are equally
tempting, and pastel china makes ev-
ery course appetizing. Despite the
good main dishes, we have a great
suspicion that most folks await the
“perfect French Pastry” with even
more anticipation. Displayed in the
main room, on a round, tiered table,
covered with glass, they often keep
the mind off the main courses.

You may have to dig down for an
extra dollar-a-head, (dinner runs
about $2.50), before starting out, but
you’ll win many compliments from the
most demanding “date,” for The Cas-
serole is just right for Saturday-
evening “specials”.

Eat With Tradition,
Visit The Commons

For the benefit of the new students on campus we’d like to
introduce Hutchinson Commons. So if you’ll just follow me I’ll
take you through. Careful now, step over that seal. No, there’s
no trapdoor concealed underneath, it’s just traditional to walk
around it. There are quite a few traditions around here; you’ll
get ujed to it, in time.

Did I hear someone ask about Hut-
chinson? Why he was treasurer of
the University until his death in 1924.
That’s his picture over there on the
east wall. He donated the hall in
1903; it s a replica of Christ Church
Dining Hall at Oxford. The windows?
I know, they are rather dirty, there’s
a storv connected with that. It seems
that th? Prince of Wales visited some
years back and remarked that the
windows were much too clean—they
never washed them at Oxford. Then
and there another tradition was estab-
lished, one that B. and G. (that’s
Buildings and Grounds to you un-
iniated) undoubtedly welcomed with
open arms. Observe closely and you’ll
notice that some industrious individ-
ual, probably a human fly, has re-
arranged the dust of the windows on
one side to spell out CHIICAGO.

If you’ll lower your line of vi-
sion a little—that’s about right—
you’ll notice the shields going all
around the room. Those rep-
resent Oxford, Trinity College
and several American universi-
ties. The alternating shields
marked HH stand for Hutchinson
Halt The portraits? They are
placed here in honor of various
men—and one woman—who have
been a part of, or have con-
tributed in some way to the
University.

Everyone can eat at the Commons.
It was originally a men’s dining room
but it was opened to woman inl926.
No, they didn’t starve the women
previous to 1926; they ate at the
Cloisters in Ida Noyes Hall.

Are they always this busy? Well
just ask Miss Marshall. She told me
the other day that they serve a thou-
sand people at lunch alone. During
an average day approximately two
thousand ‘five hundred meals are
served. Yes sir, I agree, that makes
a lot of dishes to wash. By the way,
if you’re interested in the job Miss
Marshall is loking for bus boys.

Someone mentioned parties a
little while ago; they’ve been
abandoned for the duration. The
staff has its hands full just keep-
ing up the regular schedule as
you can well imagine from the
statistics that I just gave you.
Besides the Commons they main-

Sidelights on Footlights

If you’re ever up on North La Salle Street on a Friday or
Saturday night, it might be worth your while to locate a little
theatre called Uptown Players Center. The Uptown Players, for
all their theatrical ups and downs, are probably the most inter-
esting amateur group in the city.

They were founded by Preston Brad-
ley and J. Bradley-Griffin, their pres-
ent director, in 1924, and gave their
plays in a succession of buildings from
the People’s Church to the Civic Thea-
re. Early in 1943, however, Mr.
Griffin secured another old church,
which was promptly converted into
a theatre. A large stage was built,
along with twelve dressing rooms, a
radio room, costume departments,
workshops, and an equipped kitchen.

Now, the object of this tirade is
not to conclude that since the Players
have been awarded several prizes for
their work, and since Hugh Marlowe,
and Tyrone Power have at times acted
with them, you ought to be duly im-

tain the Coffee Shop for the
A.S.T.P. The C. Shop used to
be a favorite hangout, especially
for bridge fiends (there are quite
a few on this campus).

That girl dashing through? That’s
Babs Casper, creator of “Around the
Town,’’ featured every week in the
Maroon (may I sell you a subscrip-
tion?) She’s probably looking for
Olga again. That’s right, you haven’t
heard about Olga. She’s the “woman”
of the hour right now, Casper has
everyone out searching for her. She’s
a beautiful female tapeworm and
Casper just has to find her. If you
spot her you might let me know.

We’re nearing the food counter
now—it’s every man for himself from
here. I’ll be seeing you!

Art Exhibit Opens
In Goodspeed Hall;

One of the year’s nost successful

The show, sponsored by the Friends
of the Library and'the Renaissance
Society, opened January 28 and will
continue until February 10.

A particulary prominent feature of
the show consists of the original il-
lustrations by many noted artists.
Among them is William Steig, repre-
sented by his original drawings for
his latest book and his cartoons for
the New Yorker Magazine. Most of
the 200 books on display have been

pressed. As a matter of fact, their
last production, “The Taming of the
Shrew” while enjoyable, was certainly
no artistic triumph. The sets and
costumes, all m^de by the group, were
ingenious; the interpretation was not
extraordinary, nor was the acting, for
the most part, polished.

But an amateur group in Chicago
with as much spirit and interest ought
to be noticed and appreciated. Don’t
expect professional grace, for they
don’t have it, or at least it didn’t
show in their last play. You will
have a completely delightful evening
at the Center, tho’, coffee between acts
and all, so look in next month on

---- THE CHICAGO MAROON

Catherine Elmes

Cross Campus

This week we introduce one of
the most colorful figures on cam-
pus, Sonia Friedman, 'wearer of
suede pumps on the midway.
Sonia, known to her public as
“Sunny,” is one of ODP’s young hope-
fuls. Some of you saw her in the
Experimental Theater’s opus no. 1,
“The Astonished Heart.” The rest
of you will be seeing her in ODP’s
forthcoming production “Inspector
General,” in which Sunny will scintil-
late for ten lines or so.

She’s currently working on an Ex-
perimental Theater play of her own,
Alfred Kreymborg’s “Mannikin and
Minnikin” for which Sunny’s trying
to find a leading man to play opposite
her. Interested ?

As per U. of C. formula, Sunny is
wildly infatuated with the Gothic
architecture of the university build-
ings and of Mr. Hutchins (yes, that’s
exactly what we mean).

More background stuff: Sunny’s
name has appeared in The Chicago
Maroon three times to date. She
rides horseback and is taking
adagio dancing and aviation les-
sons (which fact is not to reach
Mama Friedman’s ears till Sunny
solos).

And here’s something for Willie
Wambaugh to mull over. Sunny hates
pink and Elsie Dinsmore and thrives
on breakfasts of lamb chops and
French fried potatoes. On second
thought, let’s not tell Willie.

In the middle of our interview, a
line suddenly began to form on
Sunny’s right.

“Why of course, help yourself,” she
invited, in a lush Pennsylvania drawl.
“Any time at all,” and she began
passing out genuine tobacco-filled
Chesterfields to all comers.

Sunny is still, however, a woman
of mystery. “A career?” she echoed.
“Yes, I’ve thought quite a bit about
it. Right now I’m interested in being
a toxicologist.” “I beg your pardon!”
“You know, toxicologist . . . one who
studies poisons.” “Oh yes, of course.
Well, it’s been a pleasure, meeting
you and all. Good luck.”

Miscellany

‘LIFE’ Goes to School?

We’ve been trying to track down the intrepid LIFE photog-
raphers who are rumored to be chasing around the campus for pix
of all the pretty entering freshmen. A couple braved the place-
ment test battery and furnished a diversion by posing all the glam-
or girls in the front row (legs crossed, too). And one of our inform-
ants whispered that some men with cameras had been roaming
through Foster Hall. We hope that this time the U. of C. will
make the magazine—for we well remember once when the girls’
jiu jitsu class went through their routine for the photogs and
once last fall when we heard horrible tales of a LIFE man posing
a non-C Man (non-senior too) on the C Bench—and all for nought.
Mirabile Dictu!

At the Katherine Dunham tea this week we spotted a Sun reporter and
a Tribune ditto in a deep and apparently amicable conversation over in a cor-
ner. What would the Colonel say were he to see one of his elite hobnobbing
with the hoi polloi?

Social Doings

The Burton-Judson lounge opened Sunday night with plenty of food,
punch, books (ah yes, we heard they went up to the library) and women. Fos-
ter Hall’s dance Friday night promises to be a shebang of best Foster tradi-
tion—as does Blake’s blue jean party.

If you see a club woman dashing madly about campus, you can rest assur-
ed she’s only looking for a date to Inter-Club Ball which comes off Saturday
night at Int House. Plans are flying thick and fast for cocktail parties thrown
by each club before the dance to assure a nice wet evening.

Bits of Trivia

Jack Williams is leaving us for the armed forces. One of the residents
of Int House won a nice little jack pot of $25 plus about $92 which was divided
four ways. The Alpha Delts and several fraternities from Northwestern are
tossing a formal February 10 at the Edgewater. Did you hear that slightly
feather-brained woman who was walking down the Midway talking animated,
ly to her companion about the wonderful play she’d just seen—something
called, let me see, the Glass Henhouse?? And speaking of the Midway, you
missed something the other day when two of our bigger BWOC’s were trying
to crawl up the side of the skating rink and finally went up on hands and
knees.

Helene, a dance hostess at a cafe,
is approached by Winkler (Eric von
Stroheim), a psychic performer at
the cafe, and offered twenty thousand
francs she will provide him with an
alibi for a certain night. She accepts,
learning too late that murder is in-
volved. Threatened by Winkler, she
is forced to be silent, but the in-
spector in charge of the case suspects
that she is lying. Helen is forced in-
to an admission when the man she
loves, really an agent of the police,
is arrested for the murder. Enraged
at the deception, she flees, but is shot
by Winkler’s personal servant. Wink-
ler himself commits suicide. The end-
ing, which detracted from any value
that the plot might have had, reunites
Helene, now miraculously recovered,
with her lover.

Eric von Stroheim most nearly ap-
proaches a dignified characterization
in a very motley assortment of people
who do nothing for the unity of plot
Although it was pleasant enough,
L’Alibi is easy to forget.

Hope Springs Eternal

We have a proposal to put before the Army and the Commons: why not
let the ASTP eat in the Commons and let the students take back the C Shop ?
Our very favorite rumor that the Coffee Shop would reopen in February still
remains our favorite rumor and nothing more. 125 new ASTP’s are coming
in and they’ll still keep the campus bridge haunt.

The Drama

Campus theater-goers are enthusiastic about the “Intimate Theater”
which was begun last Friday with “The Astonished Heart”. Everybody en-
joyed watching the play and smoking at the same time. A happy time at
the Palmer House preceded the very successful showing of “Craig’s Wife”
at the Goodman—with proceeds going to the Delta Sigma scholarship fund.

Warning to the Wise Freshman

Doubtless, a few of our new freshmen haven’t read their C books yet and
haven’t been enlightened on the subject of campus traditions. We’ll play
Emily Post and give them a few pointers on how the correct U. of C. (never
Chicago U) student (University man or woman—not fellow or coed) will be-
have himself. Whatever you do, NEVER step on the Seal in front of the
Commons—it’s really charged with just enough electricity to give you a nasty
shock in the conscience. As we mentioned above, nobody except C men and
seniors sit on the C Bench—a dire fate at the hands of the Nu Pi’s awaits him.

The dire fate which eventually befalls all freshmen—-even those who
don’t sit on the C Bench—is a nice dunking in Botany Pond under the cynical
eyes of the Gargoyles on Hull Gate who have watched these goings on for
more years than any freshman has lived. However, to mitigate the sad lot
of the freshman there’s always the consolation that no one is ever required
to wear a freshman beanie.

Every true denizen of the U. of C. sooner or later has to learn the ele-
mentary rules laid down by Culbertson, Goren. Blackwood, et al. One must
be prepared at all times for a good rousing game of bridge at the Campus
PX and anywhere else you can find three other people.

Traditionally, too, one always sneers at the food served in Hutchinson
Commons. But it really isn’t so bad—the atmosphere probably does the
trick, for who can eat heartily while conscious of several black-robed former
presidents and professors staring down from the walls?

Never, never wear any high school insignia—always stand when you
hear the Alma Mater (even though it’ll take you a few years to learn the
tune)—and don’t complain about the unwashed windows in the Commons
(it just isn’t done). Fraternities are not to be called “frats” and please re-
member we have only women’s clubs, not sororities. Just like every other
school, we have a club and fraternity hierarchy—you’ll soon learn about that.

Good luck to you—don’t cut too many classes—and remember what we
told you (it’s safer that way).

On the Effectiveness of the Modern Theatre

Last week, while sitting, mildly engaged, at a showing of “Gaslight”,
we decided that there is no end to the power of this contemporary
drama. Miss Bergman had just announced to Mr. Boyer that she in-
tended to go to Mrs. Somebodies party, and Mr. Boyer had responded
with a leer. As Miss Bergman reasserted her efforts, the vibrant young
lady next to us, having exhausted the potentialities of her fingernail,
gasped excitedly, “Good, girl, free will”.

composed of two to three thousand

'Souvenir's' Future
Plans Announced

A major portion of the advertising
for Souvenir, College annual to be
published May 15, will be a special
section to be taken by Marshall Field
and Company, the magazine’s business
staff announced this week. The sec-
tion, in keeping with the theme of
the publication, will be a nine-page
“photo gallery,” consisting of shots of
University of Chicago models, photo-
graphed against a background of
prominent points on the Quadrangles.

The Souvenir subscription campaign
will begin shortly, under the direction
of David Brill, promotion manager.
According to Brill, a goal of 750 sub-
scriptions in advance of publication
has been set. Prizes for the salesmen
selling the largest number of sub-
scriptions are planned, including a
free evening at the Edgewater Beach
Hotel for the grand winner. Students
interested in soliciting subscriptions
should contact Brill, in care of The
Chicago Maroon.

student body in relation to the func-
tions of the College, the report states:
“It is impossible for each student
to know every other student on cam-
pus. But there are small groups of
students on campus with good in-group
communication; however, inter-group
communication is almost non-existent.
This inter-group communication is de-
sirable because each group has new
and different viewpoints, approaches,
and ideas by which the others can
benefit. By “groups” we do not only
mean the organized groups recognized
by the Dean’s office, but also groups
of unorganized individuals with sim-
ilar interests and ideas.

Likewise, there is no regular means
of contact outside the classroom be-
tween students and faculty members.
There should be. On the one hand
the faculty desires student criticism
of its courses. This opinion, which
students for the most part would like
to express, can only be given to the
faculty effectively through frequent
and regular discussions. On the other
hand the students can benefit at all
times from the wisdom of the faculty.”

Pres. Hutchins One of Twelve
Opposing Peace Draft Plans

President Robert M. Hutchins is one of a dozen presidents of great
American universities who have signed a 1,000 world letter to President
Roosevelt opposing adoption of a compulsory peacetime military training
program while the nation is still at war.

In the letter, delivered to the White House last Saturday, the educators
urge the president to dday debate on compulsory training “at least until
complete victory is achieved.”

There were six points in the opposition made by the University leaders
to plans for immediate commitment by the nation to a year of military ser-
vice. They held the proposal is not related to successful prosecution of the
war; that it is a revolutionary change which should not be made under stress
of war; that it is only one element in a rounded defense program; that it
comes at a time when the American people are being told that the war is
being fought for an enduring peace; that need for it cannot be gauged until
after the war and that the proposal should be considered in the light of
military necessity alone.

Petition Drive
Supporting New
Labor Bill On

A petition drive backing the Wag-
ner-Murray-Dingell Bill has been
initiated on campus by the University
of Chicago Division of the United
Office and Professional Workers of
America, affiliated with the C.I.O.
This drive is part of a campaign to
organize University employees All
employees are eligible for member-
ship, with the exception of mainten-
ance workers who are already union-
ized.

The Wagner - Murray - Dingel Bill
covers most of those job categories not
included in the Social Security Act of
1939, among them employees of non-
profit organizations including univer-
sities. Under the bill, workers will be
eligible for unemployment and disabil-
ity compensation, hospitalization, and
maternity care. Petitions will be cir-
culated throughout the buildings on
campus.

Orientation...

hiding Tuesday evening for the barn
dance at Ida Noyes. Social and square
dancing contributed to the success of
the evening.

Wednesday was registration day,
but groups of students were also tak-
en on sight-seeing tours of the Uni-
versity. Activities Night that evening
gave them an opportunity to discuss
individual interests with leaders of
student activities.

The three day program before
classes began included a medical ex-
amination and a conference with a
representative of the physical educa-
tion department, concerning sports
and recreation. It was intended to
give the entering students a bird’s-
eye view of campus activities and so-
cial life, and time to leam the geog-
raphy of the campus so that a map
would no longer be necessary.

Classes yesterday were followed by
a meeting in the afternoon to explain
the administration of the College as
it affects the individual student. This
concluded the orientation program.

Living up to his usual box-office
appeal, President Hutchins as main
attraction at the War, Stamp Tea,
held yesterday in Ida Noyes, at-
tracted nearly 250 people to the
tune of seventy-five dollars in the
sale of War Stamps.

When quizzed about his opinion
of faculty - student teas, inaugu-
rated yesterday, he stated: “I
think it’s a fine idea.” The next
affair will be held Feb. 9 with
Durbin Rowland, Associate Pro-
fessor of Romance Languages, as
guest of honor.

Station officials are completing work
on transmitters and will set up the
apparatus this weekend for testing.
The station expects to send its pro-
grams throughout the campus via
steampipes, though power lines may
be utilized.

A final go-ahead has been received
from the university administrative
officials and from the FCC.

The station is planning to broadcast
programs of general interest to the
campus and is currently seeking radio
talent. Interested persons have been
asked to contact Ruby at Judson 239,

5 BIG TEN SQUADS MEET HERE

Jack HUI

“The only place for teams rep-
resenting colleges is on their own
floor.” So spoke Kyle Anderson
when we asked him for a state-
ment on the recent Brooklyn Col-
lege basketball scandal. We had
talked to Kyle several times pre-
viously on the same subject and
each time he voiced the opinion
that it (the playing of such
games at Madison Square Gar-
dens or the Stadium) was bad
for the teams involved.

The whole thing is a damn
shame but as the judge who has
since turned the case over to the
grand jury said, “You can’t
blame a bunch of college kids
when some gambler waves a
thousand dollar bill in front of
them.”

Baseball Meeting!

A call for baseball candidates
was issued by Coach Kyle Ander-
son who plans to hold the first
official meeting in the Trophy Room
of Bartlett Gym on Thursday,
Feb. 9 at 4:00. Anderson already
has a rough idea of baseball pros-
pects and he plans on laying out a
schedule and deciding whether the
University will be able to take part
in Big Ten competition, next
Thursday.

With the play offs of the league only five weeks away, there
is still a three-way tie for first place in the Billings league. Senior
Medics I won oyer the Spastics by a forfeit, as the Freshmen
medics lost to Billings, 17-31, and the Neurons squeezed through
to beat the Blockbusters, 13-12. The soph medics remained idle.

The Navy Frosh defeated the Blockbusters on Tuesday, 26-18.
In the college league, Burton 600 and 800 remain on top, the

And now to a lighter subject:
Mary Withington, pride of the
Sigmas and error of the basket-
ball court can be seen in action
over at Ida Noyes. The only rea-
son we mentioned this is for Hal
Patikin’s benefit.

Seems like we did a lot of talking
this week but we asked the athletic
department about the Solid Fuel’s
Administration’s ruling on coal for
large athletic buildings. According
to the men in the know such a ruling
on coal conservation would have little
effect on the Fieldhouse for two rea-
sons: 1. As long as the government
is using the Fieldhouse for athletic
training the big Ark will have a
priority and 2. The Fieldhouse tem-
perature hovers around 40 degrees in
the morning anyhow.

Ida Noyes floor during the past week.
Last Wednesday, three dorms,
Beecher, Blake and Green bowed to
Foster, Quadrangler, and the Stu-
demps with scores of 14-10, 20, and
23-116 respectively; while W.A.A.
beat Delta Sigma 34-5.

In the first game Thursday, Sigma
tied with the twelfth grade at 13-13.
While Chi Rho Sigma was being de-
feated by the 12th grade to the tune
of 31-7, Gates was working toward
a 24-6 triumph over Tau Sigma.
W.A.A. won again over Esoteric 18-2.

This Monday the Quads took Kelly
18-11, and on Tuesday Beecher lost
to Delta Sigma 15-6. Green barely
won a 22-21 victory over Esoteric.

Next weeks girls’ game schedule:

Monday, Feb. 5—4:00 Delta Sigma vs
Sigma

As is customary, about once
every two seasons, some old
timer comes up with the seem-
ingly bright idea of taking away
the backboard and leaving the
rim in basketball. The idea be-
ing to return the game to a
strictly ‘skilful’ basis. We were
curious as to the reaction of some
of our own patients so we talked
(more talk) to Bill Gray, U High
ace center. Bill didn’t like the
idea a-tall and said so quite
frankly. And so enough about
back-boardless basketball.

One more thing before we quit for

the page about baseball. At long last
friends Servies, Cimerblatt et al will
have their chance to get something
concrete on the diamond game. Mr.
Anderson has announced that this
meeting (read the story) will show
him if it is possible to map out a Big
Ten schedule. His decision rests on
the turnout for this meeting so every
interested man should put in an ap-
pearance at the Trophy Room.

Fieldhouse

By Jack Hill

(Sports Editor, Chicago Maroon)

One half of the Big Ten will
be represented at the Field
House Saturday when Purdue,
Wisconsin, Northwestern and
Minnesota meet Chicago in a
five way indoor track meet.
Coach Ned Merriam’s men will
start competition at 2:30 with
the prospects of a full after-
noon’s work cut out for them.

Purdue, in the same straits as
Chicago, has a largely untried
squad of newcomers to collegiate
play while Wisconsin will field a
roster of veterans in the dashes,
hurdles, distances and broad
jump. Minnesota remains an
unknown quantity to Merriam
but the northerners are expected
to bring a well balanced team to
the meet. ,

Badger Squad is Strong

The Badgers have lettermen in the
quarter, half, mile, two mile, hurdles
and broad jump, and claim numeral
winners in all other events. Wiscon-
sin has a traditionally strong track
team both indoor and outdoor compe-
tition and many of their men have
seen action in former quadrangular
and conference meets.

The Boilermakers from Purdue lean
heavily on veterans Ben Harvey in
the dashes, Bill Haynes in the 880 and
Calvin Davis, cross country expert.
As yet untried in inter-scholastic
competition, the Purdue men also have
promising men in the quarter mile
and shot put but are seemingly weak
in other field events.

Wildcats Return Visit

Northwestern, third of the four
team visitors, ran against Chicago
last Saturday but Coach Merriam
was unable to form a satisfactory
estimation of either his own men
or the Wildcats as the Maroonmen
were hard hit by illness over the
week end. Hank Altpeter, versa-
tile athlete from Evanston, is the
mainstay of the Purple squad.

The boys from the north woods,
more commonly known as Minnesota,
are reputedly strong in the field events
and distances but they too are as yet
unproved in inter-collegiate competi-
tion. Minnesota, Big Ten champ in
1942, has lost much of its vaunted
strength but until tomorrow after-
noon will remain an unknown quan-
tity. ,

A free for all is expected by all
parties concerned when these five
squads get together as they are all
more or less unknown quantities. It
is the hope of the Chicago mentors
that where each school is weak, some
other team will dovetail into that
weakness, thus making for a closer
and more interesting contest.

The meet will be open to the general
public with no admission charge.
