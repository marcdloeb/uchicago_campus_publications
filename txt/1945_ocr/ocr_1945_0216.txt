Russophobes Opposed
By Socialist Krueger

“The rapidly increasing power of the Soviet Union in world
politics is no victory for socialism,” declared Professor Maynard
C. Krueger today. Krueger, national chairman of the Socialist
Party of America and chairman of the Social Sciences staff in the
College, will lead a lecture-discussion on “Socialism and Russia”
on Monday at 8:00 p.m. in Social Science 122. Sponsored by the
Socialist Club, this meeting is expected to draw widespread stu-

dent participation.

February 24 is the date set for
the Students Social Committee’s
Winter Formal to be held in Ida
Noyes gym from 9:30 to 12:30.
Jack Russell and his band will play
and a floorshow has been planned.

Marine Vet Maps Military
Training Plan For College

A Military Science and Tactics Course will be offered on
campus at the beginning of the Spring Quarter. The purpose of
the course is to acquaint students with basic military training

involved in the services.

In view of the possibility that all
students in the first two years of the
College may see military service, ei-
ther during or after the war, the

The experimental theatre group
will present its second play of the

The role of Prometheus will be
played by Robert Carter, Sonia Fried-
man will take the part of Io, Sidney
Burks will double as Hermes and Vio-
lence, Bob Brooks will play Oceanus
and Hephestus, and John Robinson

routine and
under the

Marine vet-
is being or-

ganized by Bruce Shimberg. It has
been endorsed by Deans Kimpton and
MacLean, * . .

The group will hold a two-hour
class one night a week for eight
weeks. At the end of this period,
tactical exercises in Palos Park and
a contest among four platoons will
take place.

The instructors for the course
will be students with experience in
the Institute of Military Studies and
other military organizations. There
will be no fees charged and no prep-
aration for class sessions is neces-
sary.

A large number of dormitory resi-
dents have already signed-up for the
course and at least fifty commuters
who are,interested are urged to join.
They may do so by contacting Bruce
Shimberg at Burton 835.

The question will be raised, con-
tinued Krueger in his statement to
The Chicago Maroon, whether Social-
ists should be anti-Russian, thereby
feeding the fires of antagonism in
America, or whether they should “lay
off” their criticisms of the Soviet
Union. The answer, he felt, lies in
the fact that the Socialist movement
is anti-Communist without being anti-
Russian, just as it is anti-imperialist
without being anti-British, or anti-
Russian.

“We Socialists make our distinctions
between political-economic programs—
not between nationalities and races,”
he said.

In his remarks, Krueger will high-
light the affair of Alter and Ehrlich,
the two outstanding leaders of the
labor and socialist movement in Po-
land, who were executed by Stalin
after the Soviet occupation of Eastern
Poland in 1939. Krueger, American
delegate to the 1933 conference of the
Second International, worked closely
with Alter and Ehrlich who repre-
sented Poland. He also worked with
them during several trips to Europe.

New Station Will

ties had deferred the originally

tion WCHI, the proposed new Uni-
versity of Chicago radio station,

Towering, friendly Reuben G.
Gustavson, president of the Uni-
versity of Colorado and interna-
tionally eminent scientist, was
yesterday appointed Dean of
Faculties of the University of
Chicago, succeeding Vice Presi-
dent Earnest C. Colwell.

Gustavson, who gained two
degrees at Chicago by bussing
tables at Foster and Kelly Halls,
will return to the University on
July 1 to fill one of the highest
administrative positions in the
institution.

Colwell has relinquished his
duties as faculty dean because
of the press of work in his cap-
acity as vice-president and Dean
of the Divinity School.

Gustavson is famed throughout the
west for his struggle with the Colorado
American Legion in defense of ac-
ademic freedom and he is known
throughout the world of science for
his research in biochemistry, primari-
ly in the field of female sex hormones.
Threatened with ouster because he
permitted Harry Bridges, Communist
union-agitator, to speak at C.U., Gus-
tavson won statewide acclaim in Col-
orado for his position and was retained
in a vote of confidence.

Born in Denver, Colo., April 6, 1892,
Gustavson obtained his master’s de-
gree at Chicago in 1917 and completed
his Ph.D. work with magna cum laude
honors in 1925. The same year he
was invited to address the Internation-
al Conference of Physiology in London

Commuters To Meet Today
To Air Plan for Council

A seven man committee which con-
ducted a whirlwind, week long pub-
licity campaign that snowed under
1,100 commuters with circulars and
announcements today rested their
case for student government.

At 3:30 this afternoon at Oriental
Institute, the results of that cam-
paign, designed to interest commut-
ers in student, government, will be
made known and the fate of. the most
talked of, most publicized project on
the Quadrangles this year will be
more clearly ascertained.

In the efent of a large response,
the Commuters are expected to either
endorse or reject the plan for student
government. They will then name
representatives to confer with the
dormitory delegates. These two
groups in turn will draft definite pro-
posals in the form of a constitution
which will be presented to the entire
student body of the college for refer-
endum.

Dormitory delegates will meet
again next Wednesday evening Feb.
21 at 8 p.m. at the Burton Court
lounge. A committee of the whole of

the dormitory representatives has
been culling and studying various
plans for representation, next major
question mark facing proponents of
student council.

THE CHICAGO MAROON ----------

Gustavson...

(Continued from page one)
on sex hormones.

He was a visiting professor of chem-
istry here in 1929-30. Later he taught
at Colorado Agricultural College and
at the University of Denver. In 1937
he was appointed professor and chair-
man of the Department of chemistry
at Colorado.

Gustavson, a dynamic red - tape
slasher, was highly popular with the
undergraduates. He often permitted
his students to accompany him to
scientific conferences and he was
widely known as an intercollegiate
debater.

The Colorado head becomes the
second University president with-
in the past six months to resign
his post to accept a position at
Chicago. The other, Joseph A.
Brandt, left the University of Ok-
lahoma on Jan. 1, 1944, to become
director of the University of Chi-
cago press.

President Robert M. Hutchins who
released the appointment announce-
ment declared that the “university was
fortunate in being able to appoint Mr.
Gustavson, because of his long and
wide administrative activities and his
distinction as a university president.”
“We are fortunate also,” Hutchins
added, “in that he is a graduate of
the University of Chicago, has served
on its faculty, and is familiar with
its affairs. In addition to these qual-
ities, Mr. Gustavson brings to the
central administration of the univer-
sity a knowledge of science which will
be most helpful in dealing with the
great and complex scientific problems
in which we are engaged.”

Studebaker Mogul
Speaks at Dinner

On Tuesday, the second Executive
Program Dinner of the School of
Business was held at the Stevens
Hotel. President Hutchins presided
and the speaker was Mr. Paul Hoff-
man, President of the Studebaker
Corporation.

Conducted by the School of Busi-
ness, the program provides an over-
all view of business and economic in-
stitutional and processes, basic
training in the use of the “tools” of
management—economics, accounting,
and statistics, and an appreciation of
the growing importance of public
regulation in business.

Radio...

will student news coverage. Other
plans call for airing student govern-
ment meetings, the Moody foundation
lectures, Student Forum events, poli-
tical club meetings, and other events
of general interest to the campus.

The programs will be piped from
the studio headquarters on the second
floor of the Burton Lounge over the
University heating system. The pro-
grams can be picked up on any radio
set at a dial spot yet to be an-
nounced.

WSSF Drive
In Full Swing

The current WSSF campaign has
gathered impetus as a result of auc-

Articles such as clothing, jewelry
were donated by girls in Foster, Kel-
ly, Green, and Beecher to be auction-
ed off. Sue Buckingham originated
the idea and Sylvia Slade is the auc-
tioneer.

A spectacular sale was that of
Herbert Tareyton cigarettes going
for $7.25. The first auction held at
Green netted $183.00, and the second,
at Foster and Kelly brought in
$250.00 for the fund. The third was
held at Gates Hall last Tuesday. The
goal for funds procured in this man-
ner is $600. Present at the auctions
were from 200 to 250 persons.

The first All-Campus Carnival
since the one held in the Field House
in 1941 will be held a week from to-
day, February 23, on the third floor
of Ida Noyes from eight to twelve
o’clock. Sponsored by Chapel Union
as a benefit for the World Student
Service Fund, the carnival will in-
clude games, food, dancing, and as
many different forms of entertain-
ment as the groups working on it can
conjure.

“To date,” reports Ann Duvendeck,
chairman of the Carnival, “about fif-
teen different groups, among them
clubs and dormitories, have agreed
to take care of booths.”

Income Inequality
Brings Bad Housing

“Housing In Chicago” was the topic
of Joseph D. Lohman, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Sociology, at the weekly meet-
ing of the Student Forum last Tues-
day.

Professor Lohman emphasized that
the problem of housing is basically
one of income distribution. “We can
provide adequate shelter for all, but
those most in need of better homes
cannot afford to pay for them,” he
said. Anything which would increase
the purchasing power of the lower-
income group, therefore, would be an
important step in solving the housing
and related problems.

PRES. RALPH HUTCHINSON,
of Washington and Jefferson College

— THE CHICAGO MAROON
Public Is Poor
Judge of Art
Says Lecturer

“In creative art independence means
freedom to produce one’s own work”,
was the thesis advanced by John Sloan,
noted American artist, yesterday eve-
ning in his talk, “The Independence of
the Artist”. The talk, given under the
sponsorship of the William Vaughn
Modd Foundation, was held in Mandel
Hall.

Sloan, currently visiting the Univer-
sity, will be guest of honor at an
open house this evening in Goodspeed
Hall under the auspices of the Renais-
sance Society, which will hold an ex-
hibition of his etchings. The exhibit
will be open to the public through
March 13th. The display will consist
of a retrospective showing of Mr.
Sloan’s etchings which will be a com-
plete survey of his work in the medium.
With each etching on exhibit he has
supplied a critical comment of his own.

In his discussion of the position of
the artist in relation to his public,
Sloan stated his view that the public
in cultural matters, particularly art,
is the poorest judge.

“I don’t like the idea of the artist
working to suit the public,” he said.
“I see no improvement resulting from
his satisfying the tastes of the crowd.
Democracy is a perfect idea for the
practical matters of life, but majority
rule in cultural matters is not to be
trusted.”

In speaking of the various forms of
art, Sloan was of the opinion that
“The ultra modern movement has af-
forded the graphic artist a means of
mental and manual technical practice,
but no musician, would think of hiring
a hall to demonstrate the mathematics
of composition and finger exercises to
music lovers.” He placed particular
stress upon the “American Scene”,
saying that as painting it was excel-
lent and that his only objection was
the title.

Sloan took the stand that national-
ism in painting was-^s harmful to
art as to any other scientific or cul-
tural efforts by preventing broad hu-
man understanding. Another feature
in painting Mr. Sloan lashed out
against was competition among crea-
tive artists as an evil, that has its
basis in a sense of inferiority.

He concluded his address with “All
men are interdependent in our society
and should be ready to recognize that
fact. The creative artist must never-
theless have freedom and independence
to produce his own work . . . Progress
depends on independent thought in
both art and science.”

John Sloan is one of America’s most
noted artists and teachers, and a mem-
ber of the American Academy of Arts
and Letters. He has written a number
of books on painting and art instruc-
tion.

Menacing Portents!

That vague and intangible something, academic freedom,
stirred and rumbled again last week. At William and Mary the
forces of bigotry scored a sordid victory over freedom of expression.

The William and Mary case, when brought together with the
recent University of Texas incident, is a menacing portent, for it
may indicate the line of attack against all liberal thought to be
carried out insidiously during the postwar era.

The full story of the William and Mary case will be found in
the adjoining column. But the most important detail, namely
that the administration possesses the right to curb and conrol
a college publication in its attempt to enunciate a progressive
policy that extended even beyond the borders of the university
and into the very structure of American society itself, has not
been emphasized. The danger is not so much that the authorities
should retain the power to control the newspaper, as it is that such
power should be wielded to supress and crush valid intellectual
and journalistic processes. At the Virginia school, it was the
race problem; at Texas, it was labor; at Georgia, it was regional
politics and political boondogling.

Of even more interest, however, is the stand which has been
taken in all three incidents by the student body. At Georgia, it
was the alumni together with matriculants at the institution who
drove Governor Gene Talmadge from the executive mansion and
his meddling with the university. At Texas, thousands of students
demonstrated in protest when President Howard T. Rainey was
ousted by the board of trustees as he supported three economics
professors who had been replaced for defending labor’s wartime
record. And at William and Mary, the student body unanimously
upheld the editor and the newspaper. They preferred no news-
paper to one dictated to by authorities with such narrow prejudices.
Are progressive student bodies to be submerged by ruthless and
vested interests ? Are interests which fear free and open discussion
of the rights of labor, of the position of the Negro, of research in
the field of social sciences to control the destinies of the American
educational process ? Moreover, why vested interests in education
in America at all? In short, is the university a vehicle of expres-
sion and indoctrination for a select few?

The facts are pregnant with danger and disaster. Student
bodies the nation over should take note.

Be At That Meeting!

This afternoon at 3:30 in Breasted Hall a meeting of students
will be held to determine whether or not this University is to have
the representative all-student council it needs so badly, or whether
it will have no council at all. Although the gathering is advertised
as being a commuter affair for the express purpose of securing
equal participation in student government with the dormitory stu-
dents, it is actually more important than that.

The assembly will have two major tasks: 1) an unqualified
endorsement of the principle of student government as the best
means to solve those campus-wide problems which we all recognize
as vital problems; and 2) the selection of a capable and repre-
sentative committee to meet with a similar dormitory committee
and work out an acceptable plan for government.

But the first problem to be met at this meeting, the endorse-
ment of the principle, is the most important. Without such an
endorsement, there can be no government of any kind. A true
student council must, of necessity, include those people who make
up the greater part of the student body. And if an endorsement
is to be forthcoming with the same unanimity and enthusiasm as
shown by the dormitory students, then there must be present
at this afternoon’s meeting the overwhelming majority of com-
muters, so that there will be no doubt as to the validity of the
stand taken by the assembly.

This, therefore, is a great challenge to you students to make
democracy a reality on your campus! BE AT THAT MEETING!

Paper Barred
For Race Stand

A college editor who advocated
racial equality at William and
Mary College at Williamsburg,
Va., was suspended from classes
this week, after stirring a nation-
wide tempest. The William and
Mary incident headlined week-
long events in American univer-
sities.

Students of the college supported
the editorial which was to have ap-
peared in this week’s issue of the
campus publication, “Flat Hat.” The
editorial urged that “Negroes attend
our school, marry among us, and be
our roommates.” Publication was
suspended although in a mass meet-
ing students upheld the newspaper
by unanimous vote.

Speakers Spiff Over
Enterprise Freedom

“Is Our System of Free Enterprise
Doomed?” was the topic discussed by
Will Sparks, Dale Stucky, Bert Wax,
and Howard Savage at the Chicago
Speaks Forum last Saturday night.

The speakers were agreed that we
did not have a system of free enter-
prise in the United States today.
The Wax-Sparks team maintained
that we had little chance of achiev-
ing such a system because of the
control of public opinion through the
press and radio by the moneyed mo-
nopolistic few. They conceded the
existence of anti-trust laws but de-
nied the effective use of them.

The Stucky-Savage team held that
their opponents’ line of thought ad-
mitted the hopelessness of achieving
social justice and an equitable dis-
tribution of wealth. They pointed to
a number of specific examples of re-
cent court actions against the trusts.
Though these actions have been gen-
erally ineffective they maintained
that with public support and cooper-
ation, free enterprise can be made
to work.

Betty Stearns

Sidelights on Footlights

One might ask a very pertinent question about O.D.P.’s pro-
duction of “The Inspector General” presented last week. Did they
intend to put on Gogol’s satire, dr did they intend to do a very
humorous burlesque? If they strove for the former, they failed.
If the latter was their goal, they were successful.

The actors enjoyed themselves and
the audience was highly amused. In
fact, there was only one flaw in the
perfection of the evening—the may-
or’s last speech. For in such a bla-
tant interpretation, in which the com-
ic, rather than the satiric was stress-
ed, the advice to the audience on cor-
ruption was irrelevant.

It becomes increasingly tiresome
to engage in the device of relegating
the O.D.P. productions to the ranks
of farce and low comedy before they
can be discussed in terms of good en-
tertainment. Moreover it seems a
pity to waste the talents of a group
of students so obviously inclined to
overact on a work which could be
most advantageously underacted.
(See Gogol’s own notes.) There are
plenty of plays which call for the
former type of treatment; “The In-
spector General” does not.

But there’s no sense delving into
the realm of fantasy. The play was
funny, and the actors deserve credit.
Mr. Cohen, as the mayor of the
small town, trying to bribe the mis-
taken inspector general, was laugha-
ble and consistent in the caricature
he constructed. Although William
Ivie, John Tarburten, Alan Boulton,
Marvin Mindes, Curtis Crawofrd and
Edwin Goldberger didn’t have much
to do, as the town’s political hierar-
chy, they were all adequate for their
parts. Margaret Kraemer gave a
rather strange portrayal of the may-
or’s wife, which under the circum-

Reading the Constitution in Social
Science started Otto wondering if
perhaps it wasn’t time for your
Around-the-Towner to tell some of
the newer readers, and possibly the
older ones, just what goes on in this
corner of the Maroon, other than
chewing. So here goes enlightenment
—guaranteed, among other things,
not to make you think.

At this point Otto amends our doc-
ument by adding that one of our main
aims is to discover the whereabouts
of Olga, obviously most gracious of
all lady tapeworms.

Wiping weary brows and folding
our grey cell away for the winter, we
gathered Otto up from his day-dreams
of Olga and headed for the Walnut
Room of Marshall Field.

Since it was just 4:00 o’clock
(MUST you ask why?) we were set
for a most enjoyable afternoon snack,
a “spot of tea.”

Tea in the Walnut Room is relax-
ing, refreshing and delicious. Few
places in this war-tense year bother
with the niceties of life, but Fields’
seems to have realized the value of
pleasant surroundings, soft music and
a light snack to revitalize at the end
of a weary day. .

Piping-hot tea is drawn from high-
ly polished silver samovars, which are
placed on a long white-clothed table.
Here tea, sandwiches, and tempting
salads are arrayed at their best. Any
choice is well worth the moderate
price asked.

After a tiring day of shopping, tea
at the Walnut Room is a reward to
jangled nerves. Needless to say,
lunch and Monday dinners are equal-
ly delightful.

Maynard Wishner did an elegant
job with the foppish Hlestakov. De-
veloped skillfully, the St. Petersburg
clerk became real and believable.
This character, with one exception,
was the only one which might possi-
bly have found itself in a more so-
phisticated presentation of Gogol.
Roberta Unger did not, it is true,
have a very large part. But, Russian
ingenues being notoriously difficult,
she rendered the mayor’s inviting
daughter with ease, or whatever ad-
jectives one applies to silly young
girls, well played. The many others
in the cast, especially George Sorter
and the versatile Robert Voas, did
what they were supposed to do very
nicely.

The set, designed and executed by
Charles Walls and Clayton Judy, was
excellent, and so was the lighting.
Eleven members of the University
Orchestra furnished incidental mu-
sic with the customary warmth.

One Self

Though the final act of World War
II is yet to be played, the world has
seen enough of the script to know
that there can be but one ending—a
total military victory for the United
Nations against our Axis enemies.
However, the realization that politi-
cal ramifications of the conflict will
shape our future for decades to come,
is reason enough for taking a closer,
more searching look at the words and
deeds of those Who shape our desti-
nies, and the implications which may
be drawn from them.

What are the prospects that the
unholy alliance between the Republi-
can old guard and right wing South-
erners will continue its control over
Congress? The spectre of this coali-
tion has been haunting liberals for
the past five years. Will it continue?

Two distinct events make it possi-
ble to hope that not only will the co-
alition be made ineffective, but that
it will be replaced by vigorous liber-
alism. For one thing, the bitter
struggle against Mr. Wallace’s ap-
pointment as Secretary of Commerce
carries with it one promising implica-
tion. Speaker Rayburn, in his fight
for Wallace, has caused a definite
break in Southern ranks. The line has
been drawn between him and Rankin
of Mississippi. The pro-Wallace
strategy is sound and practical, and
the fight, as far as the Southerners
are concerned will be a showdown. A
victory for Raybum and Wallace will
mean the complete negation of Ran-
kin’s influence in Congress, and a se-
rious defection from the right wing
stand of the Bourbon Democrats. .

A second and completely unexpect-
ed incident occurred in Georgia last
week when Governor ArnaU pushed
through a bill to eliminate the poll
tax. This can only be interpreted as
an indication of the steady and en-
couraging growth of native Southern
liberalism. The Pepper-Albright-Ma-
verick ranks are swelling. ,

The rise of Southern liberals can
only mean a split in the unholy Con-
gressional alliance, and the increas-
ing number of young progressive Re-
publicans can well spell the end of
any further serious obstructionism
from the “hate-Roosevelters” on Cap-
itol Hill.

“Eternal Mask”, the third fic-
tion' film to be presented this
quarter, was an experiment in
using the cinema for dramas of
the mind’s twists and illusions.
The plot is comparatively simple.
Believing that his experiment with
an unproved serum has brought about
the death of a man, a young doctor
tries to forget the tragedy of his life
.by disassociating his present and his
past. In so doing, his personality is
split, and his whole purpose in life
is turned to running away from his
former self.

The disconnected wanderings of a
deranged mind, seeking to escape
harsh reality, are something entirely
new and different in movie material.
The whirling mists of uncertainty,
the shifting shades of shadow and
light, the aimless wandering through
endless mental catacombs are all
skillfully woven together to produce
a pattern of bewildering emotion.

In spite of the rather poor sound
track and the faulty production which
often characterizes foreign films,
“Eternal Mask” did well in fixing it-
self in the minds of the audience. The
originality of its plot, strengthened
by the accuracy of psychological re-
search and integrity in its presenta-
tion, held the audience’s attention to
the end.

Chapter XIV

Our mention of the famous pre-Civil War book, Uncle Tom’s
Cabin, has brought forth such a flood of demands from paid
employees that we elucidate upon it. Because this work was one
of the approximate causes of the Civil War, we feel it our duty
to comply with the requests. ___________________

This is a touching story of life in
the deep South, which first appeared
in 1852 in cereal form. (The truth
of this becomes obvious to the book’s
most casual readers). It concerns
the activities of a vibrant slave girl
named Topside, who just glowed, and
a fighting Southern Belle named
Eve. These two girls were living
in peace, harmony, etc., in the pleas-
ant little hamlet of Rumancoke, Ken-
tucky, when the horrible news was
heard that the census taker was com-
ing to Kentucky. Here the student
must be reminded of the constitu-
tional provision which stated that
three-fifths of all slaves should be
counted in the census. The Kentucky
countryside became a scene of hor-
ror, desolation, etc. as owners set
about cutting all their slaves into
fifths. The owner of the plantation,
where Topside and Eve lived, was es-
pecially loathed to do this as she con-
sidered herself too old to do much
cutting up. The owner, a relative of
Eve’s named Auntie Bellum, there-
fore, entrusted the carving to her
overseer, Simon Debris.

The scene was so bloody that
Little Eve could no longer en-
dure it. She wished that she
might leaVe the troubled land of
Kentucky forever to go to a hap-

The Istar Variations of d’Indy,
written during the year 1896, are a
musical representation of the Baby-
lonian goddess Istar, describing her
descent into Aralu (Hell) to deliver
her lover, the Sun God. The goddess
must pass through seven gates to en-
ter the underworld: at each of the
seven gates she is deprived by the
warder of that gate of some part of
her attire.

The score is prefaced by a para-
phrase of the Babylonian poem which
describes Istar’s entry into the under-
world and the article of attire left
at each gate. Cast in the form of
seven variations and a coda, each of
the variations is intended to symbol-
ize one stage in the disrobing. In the
seventh variation, which accompanies
the text, “The warder at the seventh
gate.. .removed the final veil cover-
ing her body,” the full orchestra, for-
tissimo, states the theme, which hith-
erto has been given only in frag-
ments, in full for the first time.

This work which once upon a time

pier place, where slavery was
unknown. Poor little Eve’s wish
was granted for she was called
away to Heaven, a small mining
town in Alliquippa County, Pa.
On her way to Heaven she was
forced to cross the Ohio River on
an ancient ferryboat called the
“Ice”.

Little Eve’s old slave friend, Uncle
Tom, was so distracted by the
thought of the girl’s doing anything
so horrible as traveling on an Ohio
ferryboat, that he allowed himself to
be caught putting Scotch into a mint
julep he was making for the census
taker. Simon Debris reminded him
that he could be drawn and quartered
for this. Because he had already been
fifthed and because he wasn’t espe-
cially photogenic, the plan of draw-
ing and quartering was abandoned.
Because Simon Debris was suffering
from a peculiar Southern disease
called the Po’ White Trash, he was
so irritable as to refuse to forgive
Uncle Tom. He decided to sell the
poor slave to an indigo plantation.
Uncle Tom knew the horrors of being
near indigo, for one of his Cows had
once eaten some and burped at ten
second intervals for 73 days. This
was a trade disease known as Mooed
Indigo.

Tells of Trials,
Tribulations In
Obtaining Book
by George Buckingham MacDonald, Jr.

To my mind, Harper Memorial Li-
brary needs more reforms than you
could shake a stick at. I think I
share the sentiments of a great many
students who have made that brave
attempt of all attempts—to get a book
from Harper stacks.

Some time ago, when I first entered
the University, I innocently tripped
to the library, thinking that by a
reasonable process I would be able to
procure the desired volume.

I eagerly looked up the call number,
filled out my slip, and dropped it into
the wire basket. I waited, quite at
ease, for fifteen minutes.

When twenty-five minutes had
elapsed I timidly, and most respect-
fully approached the counter and
asked if maybe hadn’t something
frightful happened to the stack boy?

(At this point I received a sweet
smile and the explanation that the
stacks are very extensive, and it takes
quite some time to go to a remote
section and find a book.)

I went and sat down cheerfully,
confident that my book would come
very soon. After about ten minutes,
I heard my name called and I noticed
with horror that the attendant held in
her hand, not a book, but my call slip.
She must have pushed a little buzzer
somewhere, for a smile flashed on.
She couldn’t have buzzed very long
though; it flashed right off again.
“This book has been lost since 1911.”
I made a valiant attempt to keep my
wits about me. I asked, “Why don’t
you remove the cards for these books
from the card catalogue? Then people
wouldn’t expect to find them here.”

Innumerable times since then, I have
made the same fruitless trip—to Har-
per for a book claimed by the card
catalogue to be contained in the stacks
—only to be told after twenty or
twenty-five minutes that “This book
has been lost for simply years, my
dear.”

By the time I became a Fellow, I
didn’t think very much of the library,
but, having a stack permit, I no longer
needed to spend endless hours of
wasteful waiting in W-31. I simply
went and looked for the book myself,
and if it wasn’t there, too bad, but at
least I escaped the Courteous waiting.
I was yet to discover the true malice
that lurkes in those walls.

I had taken a book out on a Fellow
charge. I returned this book to Coun-
ter I in Harper W-31 in approximately
three weeks. At the end of the quarter
I was asked to come in and look over
my cards, make sure I actually had
the books charged to me, return the
ones I didn’t want, and renew the
books I still needed. Imagine my
amazement when I discovered that
this book was still charged to me.
However, I pretended to the librarian
in charge of Fellows and members of
the Faculty that I still had the book,
and need it for some time. I did this
because I realized that if I admitted
not having the book, I would be
charged for its loss, no matter how
strongly I might maintain that I had
returned it several weeks before. I
immediately rushed down to the stacks
and looked on the shelves for this
book. It was not in its place this first

Are You the Pin-Up Type?

Attention, beauties—we just received a little notice from the
175th Infantry Regiment in the E.T.O. to the effect that they’re
looking for a queen. All you have to do is be a sweet single girl,
who likes the doughboy, and be a good cook. If you fit these
requirements, just stand in front of the photgrapher, strike a pose,
and send the results to Sgt. Jack E. Bear, Artist and Historian,
175th Regt. Hq., U.P., APO #29, U.S. Army, % Postmaster, New
York City. We don’t believe you have to send a sample of your
cooking, however. Here’s a good chance to prove Chicago girls
are prettier than Northwestern coeds (who don’t seem to be
considered so good-looking by the V-12’s on their campus).

Inter Club Ball

Low lights, good music (except for the innumerable renditions of Rum
and Coca-Cola), and lots of eligible males spelled out a VERY nice evening
for all club women and their GDI guests who attended IC Ball at Interna-
tional House. We report that Int House is the nicest place on campus for
a formal—if you have to have the dance on campus. As we predicted, nearly
everyone arrived well fortified against the cold weather from various cock-
tail parties, among them Sigma, Wyvern, Sigma Chi, and PDU (at which we
lapped up nothing less than real Scotch!). The date bureau did a land-office
business.

Traditionally, one big surprise occurs every year at Inter Club, and this
year was no exception—at a large gathering at Martin’s after the dance, it
was announced that Chi Rho Jean Staver and Sigma head, Don Coe, were
married last September. More people are getting coy about announcing
their weddings this year...

Socialites All

Beecher Hall is planning a formal for February 16 complete with a two-
day late Valentine theme and floor show (it’s never too late for a good leg
show). Midyear rushing began this Monday and the libraries are already
noticeably depleted of club women and freshmen hopefully deserting the
books. The blue jeans gathering at Blake two weeks ago was so successful
that rush calls were sent all over campus for more girls! The next five week-
ends promise to be busy for the Sigma Chis who have parties in prospect
every week. There was nothing fishy about the good times had at Green
Hall’s Neptune Ball recently; among those present were Davy Jones Esq.
and Minnie the Mermaid who graced the walls.

Anthropology 201

Professor Fay Cooper-Cole, long one of the campus’s favorites, hobbled
into the classroom on crutches one day last week. A sudden hush of sym-
pathetic silence fell over the buzzing students as he went up to the lecture
stand. Mr. Cole turned around and smiled, “Really, it’s not so bad as it
looks, you know.” Ahd during the next class period a very concerned stu-
dent loudly assured him that the class wouldn’t mind at all if he sat down
while lecturing.

Gossip

Rumor has it that several clubs are attempting to abolish the clauses
in their constitutions which restrict Negro and Jewish girls from member-
ship. Tom Larkin, former Calvert Club president, was in town last week
while waiting for his wings and commission in the Navy Air Corps. Habi-
tues of Ida Noyes have doubtless remarked the absence of the familiar poker
game from the second floor. It seems the boys were caught playing for
money and were sent little notices from the Dean’s Office to the effect that
they’d “leave” school if they were found playing even solitaire. Elaine
Murdoch and Dick Harrison got themselves hitched last Tuesday instead of
waiting until June.

Enjoy Yourselves

And get into arguments over O. I. I. today from four to five-thirty
in the Ida Noyes Library. Joe Schwab will be the faculty guest of honor
at the War Stamp tea. It’s promised that the food will be good—just as
good as last week when Professor Durbin Rowland of the green snakes (he
doesn’t have them any more—just toads) and innumerable anecdotes shared
the honors with Dean Maclean.

Odds and Ends

Newest and most exclusive group on campus is the Gargoyles Club
(really, it’s not quite the same as Daisy’s club in the Tribune funnies); from
what we can gather, eligibility is limited to those who are pinned to a chim-
era and have perched on the drain pipes of Rheims or Chartres Cathedrals.
Gates Hall is now the prefect antidote for the sea-sick green of Hutch’s of-
fice—Gates has finished its painting job and resembles a very neat hospital
in black and white. Notes on the small clothes closets in Blake—hanging
from a hall light fixture on the third floor were a skirt and several more in-
timate articles of apparel. Something ought to be done about this suitation!

Life Magazine is anxious to take a picture of Harper Reading Room,
but has been hamstrung for two weeks because so few people study in
there. If it is not too inconvenient, will you please continue your studies
in the Reading Room? The picture will take half an hour or less. If you
come, please sit fairly still and don’t look for or at the camera. Thank you.

fifteen times I tried. Two quarters
passed; at the end of each I renewed
this book as though it were in my
possession. Then, late one evening I
stopped to speak to a friend at his
desk in the stacks. What should I see
on his shelf but the long-lost book,—
with no cards in the back. I gave my
pal a sound thumping for taking a
book off the shelves to his desk without
charging it to himself. The great mys-
tery—how did it get from Counter I
in Harper W-31 to stacks with no
cards in the back, without my name
being cleansed from the record; in
short, how can one return a book to
Harper without the crawling feeling
that one day soon he will be called upon
to pay and pay for the book that is
missing simply because someone in
W-31 made an error. Of course, I
suffered in this instance only mentally,
but a young friend of mine is being
forced to pay $3.50 for a book he
returned before his two-week ‘lease’
was up. He persevered in repeating
time and time again that he had re-
turned the book, but to no avail. He
must pay the $3.50 under threat of
being reported to the Bursar, who in
turn will doubtless double the price.
• Does the Harper staff imagine itself
to be infallible? Can it make no mis-
take? Is it never an injustice to force
a student to pay for a book he re-
turned?

Forum Plans Tryouts

For Varsity Debaters

Four University of Chicago debaters and panelists will be selected at
tryouts March 2 to represent the University in the annual Big Ten debate
conference at Northwestern, Dale M. Stucky, director of Student Forum,
announced this week.

Stucky, who released details of the tryout, called on interested speakers
to register at the Forum Offices in Lexington Hall. Each speaker will pre-
sent an analyses of the debate topic, “What Shall We Do With Germany,” to
be followed by cross examination by the judges. The four highest ranking
debaters will then represent Chicago at the Northwestern Conference March
8 and 9.

Stucky, in a circular to club members, noted that last year Chicago tied
for first place in the conference. However, none of the championship-win-
ning debaters have returned, thus leaving an open field for new students.




Friday, February 16, 1945----

Jack Hill

Time In

We caught the double-header
at the Stadium, last Saturday,
and were quite impressed by the
show put on. Northwestern al-
most did it and Oklahoma almost
did it, but Ohio and DePaul won,
anyhow.

That Kurland is a long, long
boy. On a drive-in shot, he actu-
ally threw the ball down through
the net. The crowd, approxi-
mately 15,000, got a big kick out
of it too. Mr. Mikan looked like
a better center to us though, he’s
slightly more co-ordinated and
stuff.

The Intramural Leagues are tight-
ening up. With only one or two
games left for most of the teams, the
play-offs look pretty well set, al-
though there is always the possibili-
ty of an upset. Frankly, the refer-
eeing, while admittedly hard, has
been pretty poor. Nick Parisi has
done his best but he can’t make the
refs come around and that’s all there
is to it.

The first baseball meeting
was only fair. The Maroons can
look forward to a good outfield
and an air-tight infield if John
Spencer makes up his mind to
come out. Fred Cimmerblatt,
leader in the pre-season organi-
zation of the team, reports what
looks like a winning combina-
tion. Jim Vaughn is looking up
at the backstop post and a fair-
ly strong pitching staff is work-
ing out. This makes the fifth
consecutive week that we’ve said
something about baseball.

Aviation Ordinance Man Second
Class, Bill Carlson, a qualified aerial
gunner and one of the outstanding
amateur hockey players in the city
of Chicago has been visiting the
Quadrangles during the past few
days. Carson is the wearer of the
newly issued Philippines’ Liberation
medal with two stars denoting the
original landings at Leyte and Sa-
mar and the second battle of the Phil-
ippine sea. He also wears the Pres-
idential Unit Citation with one star,
and the Asiatic-Pacific Area medal
with 4 bronze stars.

This is ‘we told you so* week. Chi-
cago didn’t win their meet against
Wayne, but Bokman, Friedlander,
and Russell came through in good
style. The times in the half, two
mile and relay, while not Big Ten
pacemakers, were good for this time
of year and Chicago should have no
fears about the Maroons making a
bad showing at Iowa tomorrow.

City Champion
To Be Chosen

The Men’s Foil Fencing Champi-
ons of Chicago will be determined
Sunday afternoon, at 2 pjn., in
Bartlett.

The plan calls for individual pools,
of five men each, which will yield
single top scorers—these, in turn,
will be narrowed down to the finalists.

Foster Girls Bowl

An inter-floor bowling tournament
was started by the girls living in
Foster Hall in the Ida Noyes Club-
house bowling alleys last Thursday
night. Four girls from each level
represented their floors and their
comibned scores will ascertain the
results of the contest.

Women’s basketball moved along
in good fashion this week with the
Quads, Studemps, Foster and WAA
maintaining their favored positions.
Monday evening saw Kelly defeating
the Nursing Education team, 23 to
17. Shirley Kipp was the high scorer
of the game with 11 points.

The same evening, Foster swamped
Gates 28 to 8 as Mary Sproull had a

knocked off Sigma, 24 to 10, with Miss
Palser leading the scoring with 12

defeated the faculty team in an un-
official game, 22 to 20 with Kelly
being pushed to defeat the teachers.

College Trackmen
To Try for Sixth Win
In Field House Today

The College track team ran its
total of victories to five last Friday,
by virtue of taking Lakeview for a
short run to the tune of 61-25.

Alvo Martin started things off by
taking first in the mile event, and
Chuck Grant followed up by blasting
the sixty yard dash for his farewell
performance. Martin is now in the
Merchant Marine. Captain Bob Col-
lins stepped high and won the low
hurdles, but Lakeview stepped high-
er and took the highs.

In the half mile, Stearns set his
usual pace and, just as usual, won
hands down, John Davies picked up
a second in the shot put; and Chuck
Ferris, a first in the pole vault.

But the big event of the day came
after Dave Bushnell jumped into first
in the high jump, when the relay
team set a beautiful pace to tie the
all-time College record for the half
mile relay, and subsequently best the
Lakeside men.

This afternoon at 4 p.m. the team
will bid for its sixth win, when it
comes up against the strong Harrison
team in the Field House.

Badminton Club Loses

The University of Chicago Badmin-
ton Club, playing at Ida Noyes Club-
house Gymnasium, was defeated by
the Hyde Park YMCA Badminton
Club, 7 to 6, in a meet last Sunday.
The meet was in doubt up to the
final doubles match which was won
by Hyde Park after the two clubs
had split the other matches and tied
one. •

Chicago is noted for its excellent
facilities for the game of badminton
in its gym. The lighting is above
average and there is plenty of room
for the competitors to play.

Beyer Introduces Program
Of Progressive Phys. Ed.

Encouraged by letters of approval
to the Dean’s office, Coach Erwin
Beyer, physical education instructor
and gymnastics coach, has developed
his comprehensive athletic program
to a new high. Several faculty mem-
bers took the course which was offer-
ed under Mr. Beyer during the au-
tumn quarter and in turn wrote their
favorable opinions of such a program.

Faculty Exhibition Tomorrow

At the present time, about 30 fledg-
ling acrobats are working under the
direction of Beyer, in preparation for
several exhibitions which they plan
to stage in the near future. In fact,
tomorrow, February 17, they will de-
monstrate their skill before the en-
tire faculty. ' •

During a recent interview, Mr.
Beyer wished it to be made clear
that body building alone is not

brought to being by the mutual
assistances of the squad and the
instructor in the informal at-

to educate the performers in the
wise use of their time during
their leisure hours. As all im-
portant decisions are made by
vote, Coach Beyer and his ac-
robats puts democracy into ac-

Fifteen Men Report
To Anderson in Call
For Ball Players

At the call of Coach Kyle Ander-
son, 15 men with varsity experience
reported at a meeting for the or-
ganization of the 1945 baseball sea-
son. While weak at the backstop
post, Anderson reports a fairly well
balanced squad in all other positions.
The 15 men practice daily from 1 to
2 PM in the University Fieldhouse.

Experienced infield candidates in-
culde J. Cooperider, Jim Servies, Bill
Dunn and Jay Barker. Led by Fred
Cimerbatt, former University ball
player, the outfield consists of Bill
Knapp and George Steele plus Ci-
merblatt. Probable batteries will
consist of Lefty Hauck, Knapp and
M. Corcoran at the pitching end and
Jim Vaughn, the only catcher out
for practice at the present time.
There is a possibility of Dick Stough-
ton, C man, and at present a Navy
Med student coming out if his sched-
ule permits.

Anderson is considering the pos-
sibility of scheduling some Big Ten
teams.

ing gymnastics at the present
time are becoming better citizens
and better personalities through
the carefully planned program
which is offered at Bartlett Gym.

ISSUES TWO BULLETINS

Mr. Beyer, deeply interested in
athletics and their practicality and use
in every day life, has issued two bul-
letins which are of interest to every
one concerned with any form of
sports. After careful study, he has
condensed several pieces of important
information which are commonly mis-
understood. Outstanding among his
statements is that “the athelete’s
heart” in the conventional meaning,
is another example of foolish su-
perstition and is non-existent in fact.

This athletic white paper also dis-
cusses the action of the heart muscles,
muscular development, the muscle re-
lay system, the overload principle,
which scientists now agree is the best
principle for athletic development,
the specifically of activity or neces-
sity for all round development, the
physiological aspects of conditioning
and exercise and the maintain of fit-
ness.

In closing his own article, Mr.
Beyer asks that if the reader should
find scientific evidence refuting any
part of his statements he would ap-
preuiate the information.

Wayne Defeats
Chicago 54-42

The rapidly improving Chicago
thinclads, led by John Bokman,
Al Friedlander and Paul Russell,
leave the Quadrangles next Sat-
urday for a triangular meet at
Iowa City with Iowa and North-
western. Coach Ned Merriam’s
men bowed to a well-balanced
Wayne University squad last
Saturday, 54-42.

Chicago won the 880, the two mile
run, and the relay, placing second in
all other events. The meet was scor-
ed on a basis of 5 points for first
place and three points for second,
each school entitled to only one place.

Bokman Wins 880

John Bokman, veteran cross coun-
try runner, covered the half mile in
2:06, running easily with several
yards between himself and the
Wayne runner. Al Friedlander ran
into a little more trouble in the two
mile distance as he just managed to
nose out Pryor of Wayne in 10:59.
The Maroon relay team of Bokman,
Fischer, Russ, and Turtelotte took
the mile relay for the only other Chi-
cago first.

The University can look for-
ward to next Saturday’s meet
with Iowa and Northwestern
with but little anticipation.
Iowa’s strength is as yet an un-
known quantity but the North-
western Wildcats have already
run against Chicago and made a
strong showing. Coach Merriam
believes Iowa to be in much the
same shape as the Maroons, with
a yearling crop of trackmen.
Such a situation may well re-
solve the meet into a battle for
second place, after conceding the
victory to Northwestern.

Some hope can be held for the Chi-
cago squad in the distances, hurdle
dashes and broad jump, but Merri-
am’s team is very weak in the shot
put, pole vault and high jump. Tur-
telotte of Chicago placed second
against Wayne in the broad jump
with a leap of better than 19 feet but
the winning high jump was only 5
feet six inches and Chicago was still
only able to place second.

Iowa, the Maroons return to the field-
