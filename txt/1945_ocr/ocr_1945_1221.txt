Give German
Volumes to
UC Library

A book collection of more than
ordinary merit has been received
by the University Libraries from
Mrs. Charles G. Goetsch.

The collection consists of 38
volumes of printed material with
original source material for the
study of Low German. In addition
to these there are five folders of
mounted facsimile reproductions
and 61 cartons of photographic
negative plates of manuscript
documents from the archives of
the cities of Riga and Tallinn
(Reval).

The collection was assembled
by the late Associate Professor
Charles G. Goetsch, member of the
Department of Germanic Lan-
guages and Literature of the Uni-
versity. It so happens that except
for about a dozen items, all the
material has for its subject mat-
ter the history and social condi-
tions of the Baltic States for the
medieval period. Thus, the col-
lection is of importance not only
in the field of Germanic philology,
but also in the history of the Bal-
tic States, Estonia and Latvia.

The value of this collection is
enhanced by the fact that none of
these publications has appeared
in the book market for the past 15
to 20 years.

Class in ’46

Newest development of the U. of
C. Medical School is postponement
of entering freshman classes sched-
uled to begin in June 1946 until
the following September 25. There
will be no activity in the Medical
School at all this summer as the
faculty hastens to decelerate the
curriculum, said Dr. F. J. Mullin,
dean of students of the Biological
Sciences.

As the emergency need for doc-
tors eases, Naval V-12 medical stu-
dents expect to be placed on in-
active service at the end of this
quarter, while the Army hopes to
release its students at the end of
spring quarter.

At the present time Medical
school requirements remain the
same. However, under this new
program the University Clinics
plan to slow their classes down in
order to have only three-quarters
of junior and senior classes parti-
cipating in clinical work at a given
time. Although the new date for
starting freshman classes only af-
fects entering students, present
members of other classes should
note the change of plans which
includes cessation of all work this
coming summer. It is not yet
known if the Medical School plans
to noia this as a permanent sum-
mer policy.	;

Postpone Plan to

Junk Ph. B. Degree

Unusually strong and unexpected opposition led to post-
ponement of a measure to abolish the Ph. B. degree after a
stormy college faculty conference this week.

Consideration of the bill was tabled until a meeting in Feb-
ruary, although earlier passage of the measure by a substantial
majority had been forecast.

The proposal, if passed, would provide for elimination of the
Ph. B. Degree after a specified period of time, and would inau-
gurate a compulsory B. A. with a
mandatory liberal education cur-
ricuum for all students in The
College. Under the current ar-
rangement, opportunity for op-
tional courses is provided in the

4th year of The College.

Maclean, Opposed Measure

Norman F. Maclean, former
Dean of Students in The College
and Associate Professor of English,
and Hermann I. Shlesinger, Pro-
fessor of Chemistry, spearheaded
opposition to the measure. The
proposal was supported on the
floor by sources close to the ad-
ministration and survey course
and liberal education proponentes.

THE CHICAGO MAROON,
banned from attendance at faculty
meetings by a University edict,
learned from reliable sources that
opponents to the bill had contend-
cu mat Trie college was not suffi-
cently well established to warrant
elimination of all elective courses.
Initation of a compulsory degree
might also work a hardship on
science students, and students in
the humanities who have already
charted specialized fields, it was
asserted.

Degree Said Paradoxical

Supporters of the bill main-
tained that the liberal education
should be provided all students
without reference to vocational in-
tent; that the Ph. B. degree was
therefore paradoxical to the pro-
nounced aim of The College, and
that The College was sufficiently
well established to warrant the
proposal.

If passed by The College faculty,
the measure will be referred to the
University Council, the executive
faculty-administrative body of the
University. In the event the bill
is vetoed by The Council, it is
referred to the Chancellor. Should
the Council veto be overriden by
Mr. Hutchins, the measure would
be sent to the Board of Trustees
for arbitration.

Price Hike Stirs

Pretest in Dorms

A storm of protest this week in University residence halls
followed announcement that the third price hike in as many
quarters is scheduled beginning Jan. 1.

Howard B. Mathhews, assistant University business man-
ager, and Albert*F. Cotton, bursar, jointly announced the in-
crease of $10 in dormitories serving meals and $5 in residence
halls which have no commons.

Petitions opposing the action were circulated in Blake and
Gates Hall and committees were appointed to register official
protest over the action.

Burton-Judson residence who demanded an investigation
into the dining hall operations at the courts, were informed
the raise was necessary to offset rising food pricey A 2 cent
per hour increase to waiters was also made effective, though
the waiters will pay an additional $10 per quarter to reside
in the entries.

The boost followed increases initiated in the summer and
fall quarters. Average prices in University dormitories serv-
ing meals is now $230 per quarter as compared to $175 prior
to the war.

1st Yuletide

At Int House

By RAY HORRELL

Eighty foreign students living at
International House were guests
at an informal party in the lounge
last Saturday evening. These stu-
dents, who are spending their first
Christmas in the United States,
helped to decorate the House
Christmas tree at the party.

The following day a musical
program was held. After several
selections by Miss Irene Wiseman,
pianist, and Beverly Shea, tenor,
those present joined in group
singing of Christmas carols from
many nations. Members of the
Board of Governors and their
families were special guests, and
the Alumni Association provided
its annual wassail bowl.

Foreign students will eat their
first traditional American Christ-
mas dinner tonight. Th©- tradi-
tional roast turkey, cranberry
sauce, and Christmas cookies will
be included on the menu. An eve-
ning party and dance for resi-
dents of International House and
other foreign students will be held
at 8 p.m. Sunday, December 23.

The International House dining
hall will be closed on Christmas
Day.

PBK AWARDS MADE

Three University of Chicago

vision of Biological Sciences and
Eva Pellock of The Humanities
Division.

Seventeen students were also
named to Sigma Xi, Science Hon-
orary Society.

In Peace Time

65 Per Cent of U. of C.

Students for Deferment

By HELEN TARLOW

University of Chicago stu-
dents would favor military ex-
emption for college students
from compulsory peacetime
military conscription, a bi-
weekly CHICAGO MAROON Stu-
dent Opinion Poll disclosed this
week.

65 per cent of students canvassed
by THE MAROON said they would
approve of deferment for Univer-
sity students were a compulsory
peacetime service law enacted,
while 33 per cent opposed the pro-
posal.

The most frequently expressed
opinion among those who favored
exemption was that for the maxi-
mum benefit to society, students
should remain at school. Some
comments were, “Education pro-
duces useful citizens”; “the student
should take his place in society as
soon as possible”; “It is im-
portant for as many people as
possible to attend school, and there
is the danger that they will not re-
turn after military training”;
“There should be some intelligent,
unregimented people to build the
future world.”

Those that objected to exemp-
tion stressed the undemocratic
view, claming that there should
be no discrimination in favor of
any group. Typical comment in-
cluded: “They’re no better than the
rest of the fellows”; “College stu-
dents are no different as far as
military material is concerned; all
men should be trained”; “Com-
pulsory military training is of no
value if it doesn’t include every-
body; It should come either before
or after a college education”; “An
army without people at the college
level would not be complete; this
experience should be shared by all
alike”; “At 18 such training is de-
sirable especially for the ivory
towered individuals at the Uni-
versity of Chicago”; “The training
would help students in relation
with other people and in bringing
them in contact with others from
different parts of the country and
of different social status.”

Classes Here
Resume Jan. 3

Christmas recess after the
end of the Autumn quarter,
December 22, will end Tues-
day, January 2, when the
Winter quarter begins with
registration for the new term
and resumption of classes
scheduled to meet that day.

After Tuesday, January 8,
a fee of $5,000 for late regis-
tration will be added to the
regular registration charges.

Letters to Editor

Lash Munnecke Plan

For Erasing Bigotry

To the Editor:

The speech on discrimination at the University of Chicago recently
given by Wilbur C. Munnecke and reported in THE CHICAGO
MAROON and The Chicago Sun merits comment. I’ve forgotten if
it was Plato or Aristotle who said that there inevitably exists a
dichotomy between the policies of the business office (and personnel)
of a great institution and the theories of its academic departments.
Mr. Munnecke exemplified this separation.

Race relations expert Munnecke says that discrimination “can
be done away with by a plan of long-run persuasion, not by force”
and, as The Chicago Sun reported, only education, not laws or
rules, 'can remove prejudice and discrimination. Mr. Munnecke
should consult the University’s social science department (or, for
that matter, the Divinity School) where this theory of long-run
persuation has long been discarded (as ineffective and hypocritical)
for the be' :f in the adequacy of laws and affirmative policies.

After shewing great humility in stating that “we lead all other
universities in attacking discriminiation,” Mr. Munnecke makes the
challenge that “the University will act to eradicate any examples
of discrimination if sufficient proof is offered.” This is the shabby
song and dance of Mr. Hutchins and Mr. Cowell. How much more
proof of discrimination is needed than that the University of Chica-
^°, by its own admission, is sponsoring Nazi-like racial restrictive

covenants and is giving unequal treatment to Negroes in the
versity hospital?

Editorial of Week ^^ Commuter

Thomas Mann

Hailed By
UCLA Paper

One of the nation’s outstanding
University newspaper editorials
was published this week by the
Daily Bruin at the University of
California, Los Angeles.

The editorial, hailing Thomas
Mann as one of the “giants of our
time” follows in full:

One of the finest arguments we
have read in a long time was giv-
en by Thomas Mann yesterday
while discussing the Nuremberg
war crimes trials. Mann, the bril-
liant writer who was thrown out
of Germany for his anti-Nazi
sentiments, upheld the trials on
the basis of their future benefits.

He said, in part, “This trial is
based on a law that even today is
deeply ingrained in the conscience
of the peoples . . . The law of
peace. In its consequence lies all
that is indispensable to peace and
demanded by life itself: a highest
moral authority, a world govern-
ment and united administration of
the earth, an international bill of

rights, and a universally valid had his books banned and burned,
..............*	been forced to flee his home to

criminal code.’*

Thus the elderly scholar replied
to Karl von Wiegand, who con-
demns the trials as Red mockery
of attempts to punish war crimi-
nals, most of whom, he says, are
in the Russian army. And thus
Thomas Mann replied to the petty
nationalists who hoot at the mere
mention of world amicability
through international organization

World Unity Only Hope

Mann is not afraid of what those
narrow men sneeringly call the
“super state.” Indeed, he sees
such world unity as the only pos-
sible hope for all mankind. Of
course he admits that the finished
organization may be a long time in
coming, mostly due to the efforts
of the obstructionist nationalist
groups.

He continues. “Then, indeed,
the Nuremberg trials will appear
as hypocritical judicial farce . . .
nevertheless I stand by them, be-
cause some future day will see
realization of that which now is
real to the spirit only; and when
that day comes, mankind will rec-
ognize proceedings now taking
place in a shattered old German
town as a prelude to this reality.”

Mann ignores, for the most part,
those who flatly oppose interna-
tional unity, but he confutes the
arguments of those (as von Wie-
gand) who oppose the trials for
other reasons. He considers that
critics say the judging powers are
not completely innocent; that the
accusing powers are also doing the
judging: that no law exists provid-
ing for the trial of the Hitler gov-
ernment.

But he downs these arguments
by pointing out that the prosecu-
tors, through Justice Jackson,
have made it clear that it is not
Russia, Britain, United States, who
bring the charges, but civilization
itself. Civilization, that mute and
suffering spirit, which Mann calls
the “soul of mankind,” is seeking,
redress for the injustices it has ■
suffered.

Nazis Planned for Years

Also, Mann uses the Nazis’ pre-
determination of war as a second
point in his argument. The fact.
that they planned for years and :
realized their responsibility leaves
them liable for trial as conspira-
tors against the peace. He con-
cludes that “these trials are held
in order to establish what should
be and what had attained spirit-
ual and moral reality to a high
degree when fascism viciously
rose against it.”

Out of the maelstrom of war
and the depressing tide of the
postwar, Thomas Mann emerged,
stronger than ever, to uphold the
war crimes trials as a basis for
international peace through world
cooperation. *

Thomas Mann, it seems to me,
should be taken by the world as
a living demonstration of the oft-
rejected theory that idealism is

save his life, and even had his
richly deserved academic degrees
taken away by the Nazi party—
yet his ideals have survived.

New Dowling Play Seen as

Ellen Baum

Challenge

By BETTY STEARNS

Last year at this time we were
writing about an obscure young
playwright named Tennessee Wil-
liams whose “Glass Menagerie”
was being produced by Eddie
Dowling just in time for Christ-
mas. The strange and wonderful
drama which has since caused so
much comment well passes the
mark of being last season’s most
significant play. We can only hope
that Mr. Dowling’s newest venture,
••St. Lazaro’s Pharmacy,” wnich
opens at the Studebaker on De-
cember 23, will be theatre of the
same calibre.

The play by the Hungarian au-
thor, Milkos Lazio, has been
adapted and directed by Mr. Dowl-
ing for production in the United
States. As far as I can gather, it’s
about a young apothecary who is
prevented from running away
from the provincial town of St.

to Drama World

Lazare by his mother who had
committed the same “mistake”
thirty years before. The cast, with
the exception of Miriam Hopkins,
who is playing the lead, is entirely

French-Canadian,

are unfamiliar
ences.

The presence
cast is sure to

to

of

and the
Chicago

Fridolin

actors
audi-

in the

cause many lifted

eye-brows from the cognoscenti,
Mr. Fridolin’s chief claim to fame
rests in “Fridolin’s Revues” which
he has been presenting in Canada
for years with immense popularity.
These variety shows have been
idolized by the French-Canadian
folk audience, and are not the dish
of the sophisticated.

We look forward with great in-
terest to see whether Fridolin, who
who is not only making his first
appearance on the English speak-
ing stage, but his first appearance

in many many years in serious
drama, can successfully make the
transition. However, he has such
theatre greats as Gertrude Law-
rence, Frank Fay, and Fred Stone
to provide precedence.

Miss Hopkins, it may be rather
bloodthirsty to note, starred in
Tennessee Williams’ “Battle of
Angels” when it opened and closed(
in Boston almost simultaneously a
few years ago. But nevertheless
Mr. Williams says of her perform-
ance, “she played her part with
heartbreaking beauty and some-
thing that only a woman of poetic
understanding and deep experi-
ence could give.” We trust she will
do as well this time.

Whether or not this play is suc-
cessful really doesn’t make much
difference. Mr. Dowling is giving
Chicago’s theatre a real impetus
and a challenge by his willingness
to experiment here.

The Traveling
Bazaar ...

A Literate

We have at last discovered someone who has actually read four-
fifths of Hutchins’ “Ten Great Books,” as listed in the Daily News
a while ago. The Maroon’s esteemed music critic William R. Wam-
baugh shyly confesses to having read all but two of the books; we
might add that W.R.W. is also an accomplished cook—he baked the
chocolate cake for the Classics Club tea last week. Mention of the
great books reminds us of the menu we found at the Cloisters Club
the other day—ten book titles, complete with author, neatly listed

on a sheet of paper standing between
bottle.

People

The army soon will claim several
(as it has been doing for the last five

the salt cellar and the water

of our more sterling citizens
years) among whom are Jim

Smith, George Drew, and Stan Hart. Dave Bachrach is planning to be
married. There’s an ex-soldier on campus who’s being most ex-
uberant about being an ex-soldier; we saw him trotting merrily
around the quadrangles clad in complete regulation khaki—adorned

with flaming red socks and a neat pork pie
second thought, he may merely have been
current shortage of men’s clothing. . . .

Blood Donor

Appointments
Are Deferred

Dr. Ruth E. Taylor, Director of
Health Service, announces that
the appointment for blood dona-
tions scheduled for today have
been postponed until a future
date. At a time to be named by
Dr. Taylor, Michael Reese Hos-
pital is sending a team to Burton-
Judson to draw blood for con-
valescent serum for severe cases
of influenza.

Volunteers for this State De-
partment of Health program are
ten men from Vincent House, eight
men from Chamberlain House,
and fourteen men from Mathews.

petitions has been circulating around the libraries and classrooms.
It’s not against military conscription, not about the atomic bomb,
nor does it urge that our troops be withdrawn from China. Instead
this very interesting document bears an anguished plea to a certain
station to stop playing jazz recordings from three to five in the
morning and to substitute classical music to soothe his weary soul.

Miscellany

It seems you can now capitalize on your illnesses—we hear that
your blood’s worth $5.00 a pint if you’ve had flu. Charley Einstein’s
around Chicago again—as midwest sports editor for International
News Service. The Fijis braved the cold Monday night to serenade
Beecher Hall; we understand their efforts were not particularly ap-
preciated since they disturbed the hard-studing residents. Leo Dar-
darian was back on campus for a short time. If you should happen
to see in your wanderings a furtive figure ^kulking behind trees and
lurking behind doors, rest assured; it’s not a prowler, just an un-
happy soul who drank a little too much one afternoon and can’t re-
member what he did. He’s sure, however, that he disgraced him-
self somehow and doesn’t want to show his face to his friends.

Friday, December 21, 1945





Prep Cagers in Stagg Meet

Walking on Air ♦ . ♦

CHICAGO 57; MACOMB 40

The Maroon’s Ray Freeark climbs high to add another two points
to the score as Chicago runs away from Western Illinois State Teach-
ers College. Watching the action is Cook of the Macombs.

Quintet Wins Two More;

Awaits Big Ten Inaugural

Chicago’s still rampaging Ma-
roons made it two in a row and
five out of six for the year by
sweeping both of its latest pre-
conference starts. Another game
—with DePauw—was played last
night but the results were not
known at press-time.

Latest victims to fall before
Coach Nels Norgren’s men were
Western Teachers’ College of Ma-
comb, 57-40, last Saturday night,
and Naval Armory, 46-42, last
Tuesday. The latter game was a
repeat contest with a squad which
had previously dropped a 46-39
decision to the Maroons.

Only one non-conference game
—with Lawrence on January 2—
remains on the schedule before
Chicago journeys out into the

cruel, cruel world of Big Ten
basketball. Already assured of a
successful pre-conference season,
Coach Norgren could think of no
better way to start off the Big
Ten schedule than with a victory
over Indiana on January 5. It
might be said that the Maroons
have been pointing for this game
since 1940 when Chicago chalked
up its last conference victory.

The considerable improvement
the Maroons have shown in shoot-
ing accuracy since the start of the
season provides ample grounds
for optimism. Local cage fans ad-
mit that a victory over Indiana
will definitely be in the nature of
an upset, but point out that such
things have happened before.

It is customary at the end of a
calendar year for a sports writer
to look back over the past twelve
months and to recall the fate of
the various squads during that
time. For rather obvious reasons
we’d rather look ahead to the new

year.

Basketball as usual hogs the
spotlight during the winter
months. If pre-season games in-
dicate anything, the Maroon five
seems headed for a season more
successful than is customary on
the Midway campus. Coach Nor-
gren’s men are definitely eyeing
their Big Ten opener against
Indiana, scheduled for January 5.
An indication of Chicago’s chances
on that date may be gathered this
week-end when the Hoosiers open
their conference season at Michi-
gan.

But the cage court isn’t the only
scene of athletic activities during
the Winter Quarter. Chicago re-
turns to the inter-collegiate swim-
ming wars this year with a team
that is willing if not able. Also for
wrestling fans Coach Vorres prom-
ises what may be a highly success-
ful season. Several veterans are
back, headed by Nick Melas,
runner-up in the 1943 Big Ten
meet.

* * *

Indoor track opens February 2
with a dual meet against North-
western. On March 8 and 9 the
Western Conference indoor cinder
meet is being held at the Univer-
sity of Chicago fieldhouse

Though it may be a bit incon-
gruous to talk tennis and baseball
while the snow keeps piling up
outside, the respective coaches in
these two sports are already pre-
paring for the 1946 season. The
net squad has been practicing in-
doors every day now since the
first of December, while baseball
practice commences the first of
January in the fieldhouse.

Nor are the intra-mural athletics
being ignored. The House Basket-
ball Tournament gets under way
as soon as the Winter Quarter

Thirty-three Teams Clash
For Inter-School Title

Thirty-three city high school basketball teams are to clash
in the 26th annual inter-scholastic prep cage tourney opening
Monday, December 24, at the University of Chicago Field-
house, according to an announcement by T. Nelson Metcalf,
Director of Athletics at the University. Senn High School,'
from Chicago’s North side, will
be the defending champions this
year.

First Game Monday

Harper vs. Tilden is scheduled
for the opening date at 1 p.m.
On Wednesday afternoon the tour-
ney will swing into high gear; on
that day sixteen teams meet in
the first half of the opening round.
The other sixteen teams will com-
plete the first round on the follow-
ing day. The first three day games
will be played every hour on the
hour from 1 through 5 and from
7 through 9 p.m.

Quarter-final contests on Satur-
day will be played at 3, 4, 7 and
8 p.m. Monday’s semi-finalists will
clash in the evening; the finals
are scheduled for New Year’s Day
at 4 p.m. Preceding this game, the
two losers in the semi-final battles
will meet to decide the third and (
fourth positions.

Tourney Begun in 1919

When the first of these tourneys
was envisioned in 1919, it was
planned as a national meet with
one representative from each state
participating. Eleven years later,
when inter-state high school com-
petition was prohibited, the tour-
nament became a purely local af-
fair, and has remained as such to
this date.

First-round pairings listed in
the order in which the games are
to be played are as follows:

Monday: Harper vs. Tilden.

Wednesday: Winner of Monday’s
game vs. Austin: Hyde Park vs.
r«mUM«»cn; rkcuj Va. «<i>i>»e v civ,

Du Sable; Chicago Vocational vs.

begins. Another cage tourney for
divisional and professional stu-
dents is also planned for January.
Besides plans for other minor
sports, plans are already under-
way for a soft-ball inter-house
meet in the spring.

And there you have it. Now all
that is left is to say Merry Christ-
mas and Happy New Year.

BEST .WISHES

Bridge Tourney
Scheduled for

Winter Quarter

By Virginia Vlack

Those delighted expressions
you’ve been seeing on the faces of
bridge enthusiasts on campus are
occasioned by the recent an-
nouncement that a bridge tourna-
ment is scheduled for January
19 to be held on the third floor
of Ida Noyes Hall.

One or two pairs of players may
be entered by any house club or
organization on campus. Women
with no affiliation may enter the
tournament by signing up at the
physical education offices on the
second floor of Ida. Mrs. Leavitt,
who teaches the Friday evening
bridge classes, plans to organize
the tournament according to na-
tional competition rules. It should
prove excellent experience for
fledgling enthusiasts as well as
an excellent workout for the more
experienced players.

If you’ve been wondering why
the pool at Ida Noyes has been
closed so long, here’s the story. A
part of the pump which controls
the filtering is broken. The pool
could be operated without it, but
not without endangering the
health of the swimmers. Because
of the post-war chaos in the re-
pairing business the part had to be
sent away, and apparently this
swamped Pwf& similar work. At
any rate, the part is expected back
any day—the Physical Education
Department says hopefully.

Billiards, badminton, bowling
and figure skating enthusiasts
ought to begin warming up now.

B-J TO OPEN LOUNGES

The promise was given this
week by the combined social com-
mittee of the Burton - Judson
Courts who announced that with
the opening Big Ten game, January
5, Burton Court will be thrown
open to the entire college for in-
formal dancing to the masters on
wax.
