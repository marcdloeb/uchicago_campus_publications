said yesterday in a letter to the editor of THE MAROON
that he had no knowledge in advance of publicity regarding

Play Listed

This Winter

Noel Coward’s well known com-
edy “Blithe Spirit” will be the
first play presented by the Players
Guild during the Winter quarter.
Mr. Harley Smith, recently ap-
pointed director of dramatics, will
direct “Blithe Spirit” as well as
the melodrama “Gold in the Hills,”
which will be presented later in
the quarter. “Ah, Wilderness,”
Eugene O’Neill’s comedy about
adolescents, and Sophocles’ “Elec-
tra” have also been put on future
production schedules.

Tryouts for “Blithe Spirit” will
be held Wednesday, December 12,
at 4:00 p.m. in the Reynolds Club
Theatre. All interested students
are invited. On Monday, December
10, there will be a meeting held in
the theatre for any students who
would like to participate in dra-
matic activities including group
reading, work on the stage crew,
costume design, interpretive read-
ing, and acting.

Shortage

Vets Campaigning for
Added Residence Units

By RUTH WACHTENHEIM

Dr. Louis Wirth, Professor
of Sociology at the University
of Chicago, will address a meet-
ing on housing called by the
campus chapter of the Ameri-
can Veterans Committee in Kent
Hall Tuesday evening, December
11, at 8 p.m.

At the meeting, which will key-
note the need for action, plans will
be crystallized for student com-
mittees to assist in alleviating the
shortage of student resident quar-
ters.

Munnecke Speaks Also

Dr. Wirth, an outspoken advo-
cate of decent housing for Ameri-
ca’s “ill housed third,” will be
joined by Wilbur C. Munnecke,
vice-president of the University in
charge of business affairs, who is
the principle figure in the U. of C.
fight for student dwellings.

While most of the students now
returning to the University are
veterans, AVC’s meeting is planned
to cover all student housing prob-
lems, since veterans simply em-
phasize the problems facing all
students.

Forced to Deny Students Admission

“Students who want to study at
Chicago are being flatly denied
entrance to the University because
of the acute housing shortage,”
said David Sander, Chairman of
the American Veterans’ Committee
campus chapter, in an interview
yesterday. “Unless the City Coun-
cil takes action beyond the token
bestowal of 200 units for the Uni-
versity’s veterans, more than two
thousand persons will be turned
away from the Admissions Office
for the next quarter. “Already,”
Sander added, “applications are
being refused until next Autumn.”

“Ironically enough, there is a
city ordinance forbidding use of
park benches for residence, which
refuses to students their last chance
—or so it seems—of being able to
attend school. Assuming four men
to a bench (two on the seat proper
and two sleeping underneath), an
additional 500 men could be ac-

To Work with Britannica

The manual will include ex-
cerpts from class discussions as
well as methods used in conduct-
ing a great books class. Recordings
will be made in conjunction with
the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
which is now working on a great
books series, to be published with-
in a few years.

Classes in the great books are
conducted as seminars, limited to
about 35 people, and led by two
discussion leaders. Courses at the
University College this year have
been divided into a three year

Critic Heads

Resign; 1st
Copy on Sale

After a month’s delay caused by
printing problems, THE CRITIC
made its long awaited appearance
on campus early this week. High-
lighting this issue are three signifi-
cant essays: “Cynicism, Realism
and Idealism in International Af-
fairs” by Hans Morgenthau, Asso-
ciate Professor of Political Science;
“The Challenge of Karl Shapiro’s
Poetry” by Preston Roberts, and
“Roosevelt College: The Perform-
ance of a Promise” by Albert
Friedlander.

Reflecting its new editorial pol-
icy, THE CRITIC also features an
editorial inquiry into the principles
and policies of the University
extra-curricular program.

CRITIC Needs Additional Talent

Coupled with the magazine’s ap-
pearance came the announcement
that the four top editors and the
business manager were tendering
their resignations. Reasons given
for this surprise move were that
the pressure of academic work left
insufficient time for the sadly un-
dermanned staff to produce a pub-

program, with one class in the
third year, three in the second
year and the remaining 14 in the
third year. In response to increased
demands, three new first year
courses will be opened in January.
Discussions will not stop at the
third year level, but will advance
as long as there are interested
participants.

To Present Forums

Another new feature of the
course, introduced this year, is a
series of eight lectures delivered
by Professor Mortimer J. Adler,
dealing with the «amp fundamen-
tal ideas and problems that are
raised in the seminars, but differ-

UC Will
Fight Evils
Admits Flaws in

Work; Will Try to
Improve Situation

By JOAN KOHN

It is not a policy of the Uni-
versity to exercise discrimnia-
tion on the basis of race, color
or religion, Wilbur C. Mun-
necke, vice-president in charge
of business affairs at the Universi-
ty, declared Wednesday night.

Speaking at an open meeting,
sponsored by the Anti-Discrim-
ination Committee, Munnecke an-
swered a list of questions submit-
ted to him by the committee.
No Quotas Here

In answer to a group of ques-
tions concerning the medical
schools, Munnecke announced
that there are no quotas in that
or any other division of the Uni-
versity. Students are admitted to
the medical school on the basis
of their qualifications, he ex-
plained, and Negro students are
urged to apply.

Discrimination is excercised in
the hospitals, but by patients, not
by the University. The same sit-
uation exists in the employment
service, where final hiring of a
worker is in the hands of individ-
ual supervisors who may exercise
personal prejudices. The situation
can be done away with, Munnecke
believes, by a plan of long run
persuasion, not by force. In the
employment situation, there has
been great improvement in the
past five years; resistance is met
now only in a minority of cases,
as opposed to majority resistance
five years ago.

Negro Aids Here

That the situation in the hospi-
tals has improved, Munnecke de-
clared, is evidenced by the fact
that there are now Negro nurses
aids working there.

“I’m more than willing to ad-
mit,” Munnecke said, “that we’re
not doing the kind of administra-
tive job against discrimination that
we should, but we’re doing a better
job than we did five or ten years •
ago, and we lead all other univer-
sities in attacking discrimination.”
UC Will Fight

Students were assured that the
University will act to eradicate
any examples of discrimination if
sufficient proof of such discrim-

atic development of an idea in the
light of contributions made by all
of the books together. Forums,
participated in by the teaching
staff, follow lectures. The success
of these lecture-forums is marked
by the overflow attendance, which
necessitated moving to a larger
hall.

“The purpose of the course,”
Hulburt declared, “is not to teach
people the contents of these books,
but to teach them how to read,
analyze, think and talk about
them.” He emphasized that cer-
tain books have been chosen be-

for books and libraries.

The material in this book is the
result of a series of Walgreen lec-
tures given at the University in
1944-1945. Leon Carnovsky, Pro-

Ida Noyes Hall Being
Readied for Colorful
Christmas Celebration

By BARBARA BARKE

Ida Noyes Council, according to Chairman Gwen Schmidt,
is planning on spending a very busy time next week when
Ida Noyes Hall’s real beauty comes out and its shining copper,
dark woodwork, and a candelebra make it a mecca for students
and campus visitors.

Housing

(Continued from Page 1)
commodated between Stony

land Avenue and Cottage Grove
along the Midway.

“We must remember that the
situation is much the same in every
city,” Sander said, “and blaming
the University for what is obvious-
ly lack of foresight in the City
Council will not build shelters. It’s
no good crying over spilt milk!”
Sander mentioned members of his
group who journey to the Univer-
sity from Evanston and from Gary
simply because there is not a room
to be had.

AVC Proposes Plan

Taking up the fight for adequate
housing in Chicago, AVC, together
with other city housing agencies,
proposes the following plan:

1.	Awaken the Hyde Park com-
munity to the urgent need for stu-
dent rooms by door-to-door can-
vassing and official University
publicity and pressure:

2.	Center activity around the
University Housing Bureau (Tele-
phone Mid. 0800, local 369) and
organize a Housing Brigade of stu-
dents to work afternoons “digging
up” rooms in the nearby commu-
nity:

3.	Urge the City Council to grant
temporary shelters—old War Hous-
ing prefabricated dwellings—to
University student use, on the
same basis as the initial 200 units,
to be set up near campus:

4.	Encourage a University of
Chicago building program of per-
manent dormitories to be planned
NOW and made ready for con-
struction as soon as possible:

5.	Write to Congress to urge
passage of the Wagner-Ellender-
Taft Housing Bill (S. 1342) which
has hearings this week, and sup-
port moves for slum-clearance, re-
habilitation and planned projects
on unused land in developed com-
munities in Chicago.

“Every student now enrolled at
the University has a responsibility
to help those who cannot enter be-
cause of the housing crisis,” San-
der emphasized. “The ‘crisis’ will
not be over for at least two years,”
he added, “and cannot be consid-
ered as a momentary disturbance.”

Working with the members of
the Ida Noyes household staff,
Ida Noyes Council is taking re-
sponsibility for the decoration of
the hall.

Tom Templeton, who for many
years has worked at Ida Noyes
Hall, is already busy on large
Christmas wreaths.

Wassail Party Scheduled

Mrs. Callister, the English house-
keeper who has been at Ida Noyes
for twenty-five years, is seeing
that all the best china and linens
are ready for the Ida Noyes All-
Campus Wassail Party on Wednes-
day afternoon, December 12.

Invitations have been sent out
to members of the faculty, Uni-
versity employees, and all stu-
dents to stop in at 4:30 p.m. for
a cup of wassail and an air of
real Christmas gaiety. The Coun-
cil looks forward to hearing
Christmas songs sung by the new
chorus directed by Mr. Austin
Garrels, for it is understood that

they are an exceptional group of
singers.

Will Fill Stockings

The council is also hoping that
people will return their Christmas
stockings filled for the University
Settlement that afternoon.

The committee working on the
party includes: Pauline Matthew-
son, Barbara Barke, Jean McFad-
den, and Harriet Martin.

Miss Edith Ballweber, Director
of Ida Noyes Hall, Miss Marguer-
ite Kidwell, Mrs. Alan Lake Chid-
sey, and Miss Gertrude Smith will
pour at the traditionally gala
party.

Council Will Trim Tree

The trimming of the Ida Noyes
Christmas Tree will be under-
taken by the Ida Noyes Council
on Tuesday, December 11. Coun-
cil members Margaret Bay and
June Bonner are responsible for
inviting a group of people inter-
ested in tree decorating to help.

NEW TELEPHONES

Full speed ahead on
our biggest peacetime job

TODAY, conveyors like this at
Western Electric are carrying
thousands of new telephones for the
Bell System.

But it takes far more than just tele-
phones to provide service. It takes
cable, central office equipment and
many other complex items that cannot
be produced and fitted into the tele-
phone system overnight. On these
things, too, production is steadily
increasing.

Western Electric, supply unit of the
Bell System, is hard at work on the
biggest peacetime job in its history.
Furnishing materials and equipment
to meet the System’s immediate needs
— and to carry out the System’s
#2,000,000,000 post-war program —
promises record peacetime volume and
a high level of employment.

Two thousand people are now
participating in the great books
program. Under the auspices of
the University College, 18 classes
are under way. One of these clas-
ses is conducted at Marshall Field
and Company, for the employees
of the store; two others meet in
Indianapolis, one at the Stuart
Warner plant, composed of work-
ers, and the other at Butler Uni-
versity, including various commu-
nity leaders, among them the pres-
ident of Butler. These two classes
were started at the request of Lynn
Williams, Jr., of Stuart Warner,
formerly a member of the Hut-
chins-Adler business men’s class.
Cyril Houle, dean of the Univer-
sity College, has worked on this
project along with Milton Mayer,
Adler and others, and instructors
from the College go down every
two weeks to lead the discussions.
At the end of a year, it is hoped
that these classes will be able to
carry on alone, conducted by men
trained in a leader’s training
course, to be given within the next
few months.

Many Wait for Chance

In addition to classes taught by
the University, there are 34 com-
munity groups in the Chicago area
with a combined membership of
thirteen hundred people and a
large waiting list for every group.
These seminars are led by men
trained in a course conducted last
summer by Adler and Houle, the
first course of its kind. The Uni-
versity keeps a watchful eye on
their progress, conducting month-
ly meetings of leaders, sending in-
structors out to visit and assist
them, and supplying books when
necessary.

help raise money for a Christmas
party for 2000 children of the GM
strikers.

“We urge all AYD members and
students to help pitch in this
campaign,” stated Marie Bernard,
Chairman of the AYD. “The GM
strike affects all students and con-
sumers, because it is not a question
of a mere labor dispute but a
question that is vitally affecting
every industry in America.”

In UC Christmas Cantata

The University of Chicago Choir, under the direction
of Gerhard Schroth, will present a program of Christmas
carols on Sunday and Monday evenings, December 16
and 17, at 7:30, in the Rockefeller Memorial Chapel.

With a membership of more than one hundred forty
voices, the choir will sing a variety of international
Christmas carols, as well as American carols. The program
will include a group of three French carols arranged by
Mr. Schroth.

On December 27, the choir will present a program
with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, under the direc-
tion of Hans Lange and Mr. Schroth, at Orchestra Hall.
The combined groups will perform the Fantasia on
Christmas Carols by Vaughn Williams.

Dorothy Walters, graduate student
in the Deparment of Music, will be
the second pianist in the accom-
paniment.

Roy Harris, one of the few
American composers, was a pupil
of the composers Arthur Bliss and

Nadia Boulanger. He held the Gug-
genheim Fellowship twice, and has
taught at the Westminster Choir
school and at Cornell University.
He now teaches at Colorado Col-
lege.

He has achieved international
prominence with his Third Sym-
phony and his Piano Quintet. Har-
ris is the first American composer
to have a complete program de-
voted to his music in the Univer-
sity Concert Series.



$100 AYD Goal

As a part of its drive to raise
money for the University of Paris,
the American Youth for Democ-
racy on campus is asking for con-
tributions from students and fac-
ulty members. A goal of $100 has
been set. In addition, AYD will
collect pencils, which will also be
sent to Paris.

Lost Generations

Selective-service mumbo-jumbo soard to new heights
this week with the announcement of “proposed deferments”
for students of science. Not only is the pronouncement so
riddled with reservations as to be inane but it typifies in quite
striking fashion the confusion and bewilderment now ram-
pant in the war department.

National draft, headquarters “recommends to the local
boards” that they defer graduate students, teachers, universi-
ty research workers in the physical sciences, and undergrad-
uate students who have successfully completed at least three
years of work leading to a bachelor’s degree in science, pro-
vided the student has served a minimum of two years in a
project directly connected with the war effort. If implicit in
the memorandum is the assumption that scientific research is

Pros, Cons
Of Religion
In Schools

Pros and cons of religious educa-
tion in the publit schools were
aired this week in the editorial
columns of the Daily Illini, student
newspaper of.'the University of
Illinois.

The editorials refer to the Mc-
Collum case, a Champaign suit, in
which the wife of a University of
Illinois professor is seeking an in-
junction restraining the school
board from conducting religious
classes in the public schools dur-
ing school hours with school facili-
ties. The Civil Liberties union in
Chicago sought to restrain the
school board from releasing stu-
dents, but the injunction was not
granted.

The editorials were prefaced
with the statement that “The read-
er is left for himself to determine
his own opinion.” The Illini edi-
torials follow:

Pro • . . Religious Education

It is a mistake to wei^h the
greatness of religious teaching •
against legal technicalities and the
“embarrassment” of one boy.

No matter what, religious educa-
tion will continue. It is something
far too great to be thwarted by
even such a concentrated effort as
is being thrown against it. A com-
munity which realizes the import-
ance of religion can, with perfect
legality (if that is the question!)
have the school board declare 10
a.m. Wednesdays not school time—
and the classes will go on.

If all Biblical and moral teach-
ing is to be left to churches and
Sunday schools, three great diffi-
culties are encountered immedi-
ately. First, many of the Sunday
school teachers, although well-
meaning and sincere, are inexperi-
enced and haven’t the knowledge
of a well - trained community
teacher.

Second, fewer children will be
reached by the church classes—the
blame of which will fall on the
parents, and not the church.

And third, religion and all it
teaches should not be connected

Phelps, Communist

Communist Editor Raps 'Yellow Journalism'
Paper Commended for Stand on Housing

essential to the welfare of the nation, selective service is then
guilty of the most gross double-talk and hypocrsy. It pays
mere lip service to the principle, for it is manifestly evident
that no one will qualify for deferment under such specifications.
Graduate students, teachers, and research workers are ob-
viously either too old or will be rejected for the same physical
reasons which kept them out of the service during the war,
while there are virtually no undergraduate students who
could possibly have received three years training unless they
were classified as 4-F, in which case the ruling is needless.

The statement is ill-timed and ill-conceived. It arrives as
Congress is being broached with proposals to appropriate
large sums for the support of scientific enquiry on the most
ambitious scale in the nation’s history. By now it is banal
to repeat that the war roared to its crescendo largely by
virtue of the developments of science.

We have lost a generation of brains. Science must con-
stantly be replenished with new talent if it is not to suffocate,
but the policy of selective service stabs at the very heart of the
success of the future of scientific inquiry by blocking the source.

Nor can we any longer justify the drafting of scientific
students on the grounds of wartime necessity. No complex
hierarchy of values is needed to know that the greater good
of the country will be served by permitting students to con-
tinue their work. One does not need a physicist to stand
guard over a brothel in Yokohama.

It is simply not adequate for war department high moguls
to assert that science is “vital.” We are not interested in well
phrased tish and pap. Positive, meaningful measures should
be taken at once to implement a full scale program of scien-
tific research. As such the initial step is the simple recogni-
tion that you can’t have science without scientists.

Even more fundamentally we may ask why any responsible
student should be drafted into the armed forces today. The
permanent damage to the country’s future incurred by re-
moving students from the classrooms is enormous and can
never be calculated. Statistics reveal that an infinitesimal
average—less than 1 per cent—of released veterans are re-
turning to universities. We are not alarmists. Nevertheless,
we believe that continuance of the current foolhardy selective
service policy may wreak irreparable harm to our educational
structure.

Such paradoxical blundering in high governmental circles
is inexcusable. Examination of the entire selective service
framework would appear to be in order.

with just the church and Sunday
school but with every walk of life.

To be well educated, one should
know the Bible if just from a liter-
ary standpoint. Some of the world’s
best literature is contained in the
psalms and Bible stories.

To say that the teachers will try
to impose upon the child their own
particular creeds could be classed
as a “glittering generality.” How
many actual cases have been in-
vestigated and how many outlines
of subject matter and objectives
and aims of different religious
teachers were examined?

Was this not a direct plan to
drive a wedge between the various
church groups represented? The
little seeds of distrust were well
enough sown at the McCollum trial
to make the ministers uneasy and
guarded, and to weaken their posi-
tion immeasureably.

Religious education in the pub-
lic schools offers to every child the
chance to learn to be a better and
happier person, and a better edu-
cated, more understanding citizen.
This is an opportunity which
should be denied to no one.

Cor • • . Religious Education

Legality, and not the benefits
of a plan for religious education
in the schools, should be the main
question in the case against re-
ligious education on released time
in the Champaign public schools.

The classes being taught in the
Champaign schools were on school
time. Whether such a plan is of
benefit to the children of Cham-
paign is not the main issue of the
case, but is nevertheless an inter-
esting question. Persons who favor
religion in the schools claim that
such courses tend to lower juvenile
delinquency rates, raise standards,
and break down religious preju-
dices.

While religion courses may help
in fighting juvenile delinquency,
it is more probable that one’s

Dear Sir:

Wasn’t it Mark Twain who once said, “The reports of my death are
greatly exaggerated”? Well, I know how he felt!

Some weeks ago a student asked me to talk to a Communist club
about the future of China. I consented, for, after all, a missionary on
furlough to the United States is still a missionary. The more Americans
interested in China, the better; and to this particular group I felt I had
some definite things to say both of commendation and of criticism. It
was my impression that the meeting was to be a small informal
gathering. ”	» -

Then a friend said, “I’ve seen the placards Announcing your meet-
ing.” Next, I picked up several randbills; and finally beheld
the advertisement and write-up in the MAROON. Perhaps there was
just a touch of editorial irony in the headline describing all this pub-
licity as “Sub Rosa ...”

This letter is simply to say that I was not consulted about the
preparation, wording, or distribution of any of this publicity. My dis-
cussion was to be on the future of China as one of the great democracies,
the title not to be confused with the book, China’s Destiny. The fram-
ing of the question in . the advertisement, and the statement on the
handbill, were not my formulation, and do not express my point of
view.

I have not the slightest connection with the organization which in-
vited me to speak or which issued this publicity.

After the address—and I believe it a right of any American citizen
to speak to any audience if he believes such action tends towards con-
structive clarification—a member of the group said, “Well, your analy-
sis doesn’t agree with our analysis.” And I recalled Dean Inge’s re-
mark, “When everybody is thinking alike, nobody is thinking at all.”

Dryden L. Phelps
To the Editor:

In your article on the Communist “Youth” Party in last week’s
MAROON, you' make many statements that indicate your lack of
information. This letter will answer some of the questions you raise,
and give a more rounded picture to your readers. The University
Branch of the Communist Party is not an official campus organization.
It is made up of students and employees of the University of Chicago,
and functions as any other branch of the Communist Party.

Our program is to bring greater clarity on political affairs among
our fellow students, employees, and faculty. The meeting on China was
designed for this. We invited Professor Dryden L. Phelps to speak, not
because he supports our views or we his, but because he is a first hand
observer of the situation, and can present facts from which we can
draw our own conclusions. This type of program is what we plan for
the future.

Your bias in the news article on the Communist Party seriously
endangers your slogan of service and leadership. Editorial comment in
a news story is out of place, dangerous, and is the tool of yellow jour-
nalists. Your excuses for lack of information on our group sound
weak, when a glance at your phonebook, and a call to our downtown
office could have gotten you reams of copy.

Please contact me if I can be of any further service to you.

Letta Saroff,

Editor of the Campus Communist

To the Editor:

THE CHICAGO MAROON is to be commended for calling its
readers’ attention to the serious housing shortage facing ex-GI’s. We
of the University of Chicago Chapter of the American Veterans’ Com-
mittee are in complete accord with the editors of the CHICAGO
MAROON as to the urgenty of the problem but we believe it necessary
to stress several additional points:

1.	The housing crisis on the campus is part of a larger picture of a
crisis in housing on a national scale.

2.	Insufficient housing constitutes a direct threat to the effectiveness
of educational provisions under the ‘G. I. Bill.’

3.	Definite steps can and must be taken to alleviate the housing
crisis.

With these considerations in mind, the Housing Committee of the
AVC has presented its ‘Report on Housing’ to the CHICAGO MAROON.
We are sure that we can count on you for suggestions and effective
cooperation in the solution of the housing crisis—not only as a service
to veterans, but to the entire community as well.

Exhibit Reflects Trend of
Modern Paintings

Coptic Art
Exhibit at
Goodspeed

By Libero de Amicis

An unusual display of Coptic
Art, and of the paintings of Max
Weber and Marsden Hartley, is on
exhibition at Goodspeed
Hall. The pictures are signifi-
cant of the trend of modern paint-
ers toward uniqueness and inter-
pretation rather than beauty.

The collection of Coptic Art in-
cludes beautiful fabrics of the
fourth and fifth century and sev-
eral carvings over fifteen hundred
years old. For patrons of Coptic
Art, these pieces will no doubt
prove to be of great interest, but
to the public, they hold little sig-
nificance, except for the fact that
they are so old. It is remarkable
that such intricate patterns woven
in the cloths can retain their orig-
inal beauty and designs.

Weber, Hartley Displayed Works

Supplementing the original Cop-
tic works are paintings by two
contemporary exponents of Coptic
Art: Max Weber and Marsden
Hartley. Weber, who is consid-
ered by many to be America’s first
modern painter, was a student of
the famous French painter, Ce-
zanne. He studied El Greco’s
painting and brought to America
a new type of art.

Although Hartley and Weber
both were admirers of Coptic
works, their paintings have little
similarity. While Hartley’s pic-
tures are profoundly simple and
have a great feeling of warmth,
Weber creates a mood of melan-
choly with his grotesque style.
Both are more interested in crea-
tion than in representation.

Comparing two of the Hartley
works, “The Waxenstein at Gar-
misch - Partenkirchen” and “Alp-
spitz Mittenvald Road,” it is evi-

The Critic s Corner

The Department of Music oc-
casionally displays peculiar tastes
in program-making for the Uni-
versity Concerts. So far this season
it has been found necessary to
signalize the fiftieth birthday of
Paul Hindemith and to ignore the
eightieth birthday of Jan Sibelius,
which is tomorrow, December 8.
Certainly Sibelius’ place is already
assured, while Hindemith’s is not.
Part of last Friday’s concert might
have been more profitably devoted
to playing the Sibelius Quartet
than that which was played.

On Friday, Novembei’ 30, Yelia
Pessl gave a harpsichord recital in
Mandel Hall. Sometimes people
who play harsichords present a
sloppy and ill-rehearsed perform-
ance of Bach’s Toccata in D—
sloppy both in conception and ex-
ecution. They take liberties with
the composer’s clearly expressed
intentions and they make peculiar
and ill-considered cuts in the
work. To these may be added ap-
parent lapses of memory and un-
couth phrasing. The only worse
fate That could overtake this un-
happy work would be for Horowitz
to take up Schnabel’s arrange-
ment for piano.

It is a mistake to employ a
harpsichord which lacks sufficient
volume to be heard clearly in the
rear of a medium-sized hall. I
stood at the back of Mandel Hall
for part of Dieupart’s Suite de
clavecin en concert No. 3, for
harpsichord, flute, and ’cello. I
found it impossible to catch many
details, let alone nuances, of what
I heard. Afterwards I was asked
by several members of the audi-

Student Poll

To Determine
‘Annual Plan’

The organizing committee of the
proposed annual, Souvenir, will
conduct a poll of the campus to de-
termine the type of publication de-
sired by the majority of the stu-
dents.

To begin in a few days, the poll
will include questions regarding
the makeup and selling price of the
annual. The questionnaire will
also be used to locate potential
staff members.

The poll will be conducted in the
dormitories for the resident stu-
dents. and at Ida Noyes Hall,
Hutchinson Commons, and the
Bookstore for commuters. The staff
is very desirous of obtaining an
accurate report of the potential
sales for the annual, and everyone
is requested to cooperate by ex-
pressing his opinions on the ques-
tions asked.

dent that the influence of Picasso
guided the painter’s brush. While
Hartley’s paintings are simple, his
line and color are impressively
distinctive.

Weber Is Versatile

It is hard to write of the Weber
works. One minute his paintings
are depressing and disgusting and
the next minute they suggest a
mood of intimacy. At first glance,
Weber is vulgar and coarse, but
upon closer analysis, his grotesque
characters take on a quality of
spirit. His repetition of color in
all parts of the picture is espe-
cially noticeable in* “Discussion”
and in “The Gorge.” Flat planes
and sharp edges are clearly de-
fined in “The Toilers.” Weber’s
flexibility and fluidity of color
suggest the technique of a sculp-
tor.

ence whether that were the best
a harpsichord could do.

Several people complained after
the concert that they had heard
very little of the music. This
would suggest that the Depart-
ment of Music should set up an
amplifying system if they intend
to hire Yelia Pessl regularly, or
else that they insist on a better
instrument. The harsichord which
Dorothy Lane used in her Mandel
Hall appearance was a much more
suitable instrument. Mandel Hall’s
acoustics are not perfect; neither
are they so poor as to evaporate
the music.

Miss Pessl had an annoying
habit of keeping time by stomp-
ing. In Domenico Scarlatti’s Es-
sercizii in C Minor and D Major
she quite drowned out her pallid
instrument with her foot. Miss
Pessl also played Hayden’s Sonata
in B Minor. Her textures were
muddied. Her pace in the finale
varied a great deal.

Miss Pessl also essayed Handel’s
Sonata in G for flute and harpsi-
chord, with Harvey Noack of the
Symphony. Mr. Noack’s flute has a
pallid tone; but his melodic line is
well - drawn, clean, and well-
phrased. If he can just put the
strength into his tone which Ernest
Liegl had, he’ll do very nicely.

Besides the Dieupart, in which
the ’cellist was Dudley Powers
first ’cellist of the Symphony, the
trio played Rameau’s Pieces de
clavecin en concerts No.. 5. This
buoyant work, with its lacy Tri-
anon effect, was performed with
spirit and grace, and somewhat
served to compensate for the weak
performances which went before.

When questioned by THE CHI-
CAGO MAROON, Frederick Got-
tesman, Counsellor on Publications,
stated that he sympathized with
the problems of these students and
that he would recommend at the
next CRITIC staff meeting a shift
from a monthly to a quarterly

in student publications would pro-

Mr. Gottesman felt confident
that an equitable solution could be
worked out so that THE CRITIC
would be able to continue publica-
tion without requiring any student
to jeopardize his academic status.
“I feel,” he concluded, “that THE
CRITIC possesses real merit and
that it is of such value to the cam-
pus as to deserve the cooperation
and support of the students.”

Fraternities
Are Rapped
At Minnesota

Abolish Frats by Law, Says
Mrs. Glenn Frank

“Sororities and fraternities
should be legislated out of exist-
ence,” Mrs. Glenn Frank, widow
of a former University of Wiscon-
sin president, said at a meeting of
the University of Minnesota Stu-
dent Forum recently.

Emphasizing the undemocratic,
snobbish qualities of the social
organizations, Mrs. Frank criti-
cized the exaggeration of racial
and creed differences and the so-
cial cleavage which she declared
exists between the various organ-
izations themselves. Her talk was
illustrated by specific examples.

She concluded her address with
the statement that the fraternity
system is hurting rather than
furthering the great post-war aim
of increased brotherliness among
men.

Congratulations To

Joan Kohn and Catherine Elmes who won coveted places on the
Mademoiselle College Board. It seems that despite Chicago’s reputa-
tion as a badly-dressed campus we still have women smart and chic
enough to rate top style positions. More congratulations to newly
initiated Chi Rhos Louise Borden, Jane Hanke, Valerie Kopecky,
Pauline Mathewson, and Joyce Wight.

Sarcasm in the Sun

We note in Dale Harrison’s column in the Chicago Sun that it
has come to the attention of that eminent gentleman of letters that
our sweet young things in Foster and Green often serenade Bobby
Hutchins of an evening. It seems that their favorite song is, “Oh,
Bobby, Oh, Bobby, How you can love,” and is supposedly calculated
to leave the Mind in great embarrassment. Mr. Harrison comments
sagely: “Young ladies living away from home in dormitories and
learning to be smart do things like that. It is release. It is exuberance.
It is cute. It is Adolescence.” We suggest that for true adolescence
you read one of Mr. Harrison’s columns written in psuedo-Pepys style.

Social Life

The weekend’s parties provide us with a few newsworthy items.
The Sigma-Psi U party at the Southmoor was a most enjoyable
evening—after the partyers evicted a wedding rehearsal from the
premises. A slightly sour note was introduced when some Sigma Chis
(having a likewise successful party with the Chi Rhos in another
room) somehow persuaded the band at the Psi U party to play the
Sweetheart of Sigma Chi. The basketball game was highlighted by
P. J. Murphey’s cheer leading shirt—she remarked that it would
have been much longer if she hadn’t started sewing it about 5:00. An
onlooker was heard to regret that she started so early.

Miscellany

Two former U. of C.’ites took the fatal step—Jo Thomas with Bob
Noble and Audrey Reed with Henry Fletcher. Quad’s planning a
weekend Winter sports party in Michigan in January. An otherwise
sedate appearing gentleman in Int. House has been sporting a pair
of very loud Persian slippers, red with enormous gold embroidery.
We are pleased to announce that we have a reader of this column
somewhere in B & G; shortly after we discussed the possibilities of
filling the fountain with jello, the fountain was boarded up for the
winter.

Bookstore Incidents

A story—apocryphal, we hope—had come to our ears of the
student who went to the Bookstore at the beginning of the quarter
with a long list of Humanities 2 readings. She read off the long list
of books and hesitated over one, “I don’t know which one I want—
the dialogues of Plato or Socrates.” Whereupon the woman back of
the counter snapped back, “Well, make up your mind!” A repetition
of last year’s absent-minded female who had to leave stamps on the
mailbox for letters put in sans postage occurred this week when a
forgetful student walked over to the bookstore for stamps and put
two letters in the mailbox—not only without postage but also without
envelopes. That’s why the postman’s face is red nowadays.

Inter Club Council’s program of all-club meetings began with a

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Friday, December T, 1H5

On The Beam

Let’s look at our world—today. Tomorrow may be too late.

Today America is pursuing a dangerous foreign policy. No
longer are there efforts to increase co-operation, United Nations
unity, or internationalism. Even while the ink is still wet on the
agreement, there is talk of “defense,” “intervention,” “anti-

Big Stick.”

Communism,” and

Java, China, Argentina, and Eu-
rope are words that mean that
today freedom is attacked instead
of being asserted.

Tomorrow our world may be on
fire again. Tomorrow our world
may again have to defend itself
against a few who desire to see
it enslaved. Tomorrow, when we

need it most, our peace may
broken.

Too many people fall asleep
the switch. Wake them up!

Too many Americans find

be

at

it

more comfortable to relax. Arouse
them! Do it now. Tomorrow may
be too late.

Today, December 7, Pearl Har-
bor Day, is a day to draw lessons
from. It means that we acted late,
almost too late. It means that our
people were forced to come of age
almost overnight when they should
have matured from 1933 on, under
the bitter schoolmastering of
Adolph Hitler. The men who
died in this war gave their todays
that our tomorrows might be
saved.

We did not pay attention to the
Japanese militarists in 1931 when
this war actually began. Ten years
later they smacked us. What hap-
pened in Manchuria affected us
right here in Chicago.

Human freedom is indivisible.
If a man is dying on the streets
of Bombay, he is dying on the
streets of New York.

“We’ve learned that our east
coast is the west hank of the
Rhine, and that the defenses of
Seattle begin in Shanghai.

“We learned at Munich that
a soft answer doesn’t turn away
wrath; that if you offer your
other cheek to a Nazi, you’ll get
your head blown oft.

“We’ve learned that a news-
paper right here at home can
lie with a straight face seven
days a week, and be as filthy
and fascist as a handout in Ber-
lin.

“We’ve learned that those
most concerned with saving the
world from Communism usually
turn up making it safe for Fas-
cism.

“We’ve learned that freedom
isn’t something to be won and
then forgotten. It must be re-
newed like soil after yielding
good crops; must be rewound,
like a faithful clock; exercised
like a healthy muscle”—Nor-
man Corwin.

We did not realize that what
was happening to the people in
Manchuria, China, Germany, Eth-
iopia, Spain and Munich was hap-
pening to us, too. We were asleep.
We were disunited. That war
would hit us was fantastic.

“We tried the ostrich routine
but that didn’t work”—Nor-
man Corwin.

It was unity on the part of the
world that could have stopped the

Axis partners. But there was none.
When unity finally was achieved,
the Axis lost.

United for action. Don’t bother
about credit. The most important
thing about unity is that it works.
We might have won the last
rounds of the war in Tokyo, but
we’re losing the first rounds of
the peace right here in America.

The people must unite and stop
the coming of this World War.
Another World War might mean
the end of all civilized living:
there is the atom bomb, robot
bomb, radar, jet propulsion, tar-
get-seeking bombs, precision in-
struments for detection of targets,
death rays of invisible light, etc.

We’ve got to get On The Beam
to prevent another World War.

Our path is charted. We are
already marching into tomorrow.

Vocational

Board Calls

Job Seekers

Students who will receive de-
grees during the 1945-46 school
year, and who will be interested
in securing permanent positions in
teaching, business, or industry,
are urged to register immediately
with the Board of Vocational
Guidance and Placement, 215 Cobb
Hall.

Beginning in December of this
year, company officials will be
visiting the Quadrangles to inter-
view and select 1946 graduates for
employment following gradua-
tion. Due to the smaller number
personal requirements, there is no
formalized recruiting program for
teachers, although office inter-
views are often conducted. The
Board prepares, in the case of
teachers, sets of credentials for the
registrant, which are mailed to
school officials and thus serve as
recommendations. Inasmuch as the
announcement of vacancies in
these cases is received well in ad-
vance of the starting date of the
position, immediate registration is
essential.

Especially in demand this year
are those students who have had
technical training; chemists,
physicists, and mathematicians.
The excellent opportunities for im-
mediate placement for these men
and women in important research
work is not to be overlooked by
qualified graduates-elect.















Religious Roundup

Members of the International Seminar will be guests at
a dinner to be given by the Congregationalist Student Group
this Tuesday.

The Seminar, which has been meeting on campus this
quarter, deals with religious problems of international impor-

tance. Foreign members include
representatives from India, Ceylon,
Honduras, Africa and the Philip-
pines while the ten American
members are from various fields of
religious work, from several Chi-
cago churches, and from students’
and women’s clubs. After this
quarter, members of the Seminar
will travel throughout the country
meeting to discuss international
religious matters with various
groups and organizations.

The dinner will be given in the
George Henry Commons Room in
the Chicago Theological Seminary,
and all students interested in at-
tending may call Chapel House for
further information.

Chapel Union will have Victor
Obenhaus, Professor of Social
Ethics of the Federated Theological
Faculty, as a guest at its weekly
meeting on Sunday. Professor

Friday, December 7, 1945___________________________________THE CHICAGO MAROON_____________________________________

Maroons Win Cage Opener

Qet That Ball . ♦ .

The optimism is pardonable.
Things are looking up. Didn’t Chi-
cago’s Maroons come from behind
in the last few minutes to upset
the I.I.T. Techawks in the first
game of the year? Didn’t Coach
Nels Norgren’s men break Tech’s
13-game winning streak? Who
could think of a better way to
usher in the new cage season?

We repeat, things are looking
up. In fact, we got to wondering
if maybe this might be the year
that the U. of C. wins its first con-
ference game since 1940. With the
aid of the schedule we discovered
that the Maroons will during the
1945-46 hoop season encounter In-
diana, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota and Ohio State, all of
them twice.

Surely of this list there must be
one team the local eagers could
top. But which one? Iowa or Ohio
State? Horrors’ Perish the thought.
The Hawkeyes were conference
champs last year and have their
entire starting team back. The
Buckeyes were a close second be-
hind Iowa and are counting on
their three returning lettermen,
including a six-foot, nine-inch
center, to produce a season at least
as successful this year.

But how about Minnesota9 Well,
press release from Gopherland
contains such phrases as “. . . the'
best Gopher basketball team in
several years.” Not too encourag-
ing; let’s try Illinois. Here’s what
Coach Doug Mills has to say of
the Illini squad: “A . . . club . . .
which may be a strong factor late
in its Big Ten schedule.” This
would sound better to Maroon
rooters if Illinois hadn’t come quite
so close to upsetting a star-studded
Wright Field outfit just last week.

There’s always Michigan. The
Sport News from the University of
Michigan has this to say about the
Wolverine team: “Bigger physical-
ly, just as fast and a better group
of ball handlers . . .” Gulp! Let’s
try Indiana. This is better. No one
is claiming a championship for the
Hoosiers, or even predicting a bet-
ter season than last year. In fact,
no one is saying anything about
the Indiana outfit. Indiana could
be the team and January 5 the
date when the U. of C. breaks its
47-game Big Ten losing streak.
Nels Norgren hopes so.

MAROONS 43; TECHAWKS 42

These are two valuable points for Elliston. Other Chicago men
visible are Raby, number 19 and De Graw, far right.

Beat Illinois Tech
43-42: Three

More This Week

Chicago’s eagers met their first
challenge of the year last Saturday
night in the Fieldhouse, beating
Illinois Institute of Technology, 43
to 42, in an overtime game. The
Maroons showed plenty of promise,
although their defense against the
fast Techawk team was a little
weak in the first part of the game,
and their long shots were far worse
than in practice.

Although Coach Nels Norgren
was satisfied with the first show-
ing of his team, he has inaugurated
a much more rigorous practice
schedule this week in preparation
for the coming three contests. The
games to be played are December
7, Vaughan General Hospital there;
December 10, Naval Reserve Arm-
ory here and December 12, Illi-
nois Tech there.

Among the personalities in last
week’s tilt, Fred De Graw played
his usual stellar game, scoring
fifteen points to tie for the high

scoring crown with Smart from the
Techawks. George Raby, with his
exceptional speed .and agility
scored eight points and was the
backbone of the teams defense. Ray
Freeark and Fred King, both new-
comers to the squad, played a good
brand of basketball, well worthy
of the name of Chicago. Steve El-
liston, long, lanky center, surprised
everyone with his agility around
the backboard; it was a real loss
when he broke his toe and had to
be carried from the floor.

Romping over the Green Hall representatives, 28-14, a
powerful Beecher Hall team took the Intra-Mural volleyball
crown Tuesday, November 27.

Ida Noyes Gym was the scene of the hard-fought battle.
The characteristic of the Beecher team which brought it the

victory was its excellent team-
work. Captained by Edwina
Schultz, the Beecher team mem-
bers included Joyce Rich, Betty
Grant, Jane Simmons, Nancy Car-
penter, Yolanda McGeehee, Shir-
ley Kipp, Pat Taif, Marcia Auer-
bach, and Pauline Mathewson.
This is the second title garnered
by Beecher this quarter. With
the hockey and volleyball cham-
pionships pocketed, the Beecher
residents and associates are now
eyeing the basketball crown. How-
ever, Kelly and Manly Halls, with
a crown each to their credit,
won’t let Beecher take another

championship without a struggle.

The basketball tournament,
scheduled for the fifteenth of
January, is open to club and or-
ganization, as well as house,
teams. Women affiliated with
neither a house nor a club are
invited to see Miss Burns in the
Physical Education offices on the
second floor of Ida Noyes Hall.
Broadening the competition to in-
clude all women students is an
excellent plan and is far more
democratic than the policy of lim-
iting the play to house teams
alone. The Physical Education
Department is to be commended.

December 1 the Junior Maroons
lost a close one to Bowen, 28 to 27,
while on December 4 they won an
equally close one from Chicago
Vocational, 32 to 30. The game
with Wheaton is the first Private
School League game of the season
for the Jay-Vees. Chicago’s lineup
for the tilt will find Reaven and

Mathews continued to dominate

first in the Inter House Swimming
Meet held in Bartlett Pool, Tues-
day afternoon. Linn with nine
points, one less than the victors,
copped second spot, while Dodd
and Salisbury tied for third and
fourth with five points apiece.

Chamberlain tagged along in last
place with four tallies.

Because of an infraction of one
of the rules, Mathews was dis-
qualified in the medley-relay, but
its two firsts in the other two
events were all it needed for the
championship. Second place Linn
finished first in the Medley, second

in the eight-man relay and fourth
in the four-man relay.

Team results with the winner’s
time in each event are as follows:

Four-man Relay: Mathew, 1:58.4;

Mermen Short
Of Swimmers

Swimming is returning to the
U. of C. as a competitive sport
after a lapse of three years. No-
body knows as yet if Chicago will
schedule any dual meets in the
Western Conference, since it may
not have enough men for a com-
plete team. Coach McGillvray,
however, is anxious to return Chi-
cago to its former top-ranking
position in conference water sports
and he has determined to re-enter
varsity competition this year. So
it is certain that the U. of C. will
be represented at the Western Con#
ference meet this Winter.

he believed “it a right of any

American citizen to speak to any
audience if he believes such action
tends toward constructive clarifi-
cation.”

He said he had consented to
speak to the organization some
weeks ago and knew nothing of the
advertisement publicizing the
meeting which asked “Why Are
American Marines Fighting in
China?”

Publication Not Registered

Miss Saroff, whose publication
is not registered with the Counsel-
lor on Publications and may thus
not be distributed as a “U. of C.”
newspaper, said “University of
Chicago Communist Club” is made
up of students and employees of
the University of Chicago and

Religion ...

(Continued from Page 4)
training and background, including
teaching of religion in the home,
would be a better preventative of
these problems.

That such a plan would increase
tolerance is doubtful. By setting
off certain students as. belonging
to different faiths, religion classes
would tend to defeat their purpose,
and would actually build up great-
er prejudices.

Furthermore, it has been argued
that the teaching in the schools is
non-sectarian. Anyone, however,
who is qualified to teach a course
in religion, is bound to have cer-
tain interpretations and- ideas
which will become evident in
teaching a religious course.

More important than any of this,
however, is the legal and historic
side to the problem.

In the history of our country
the struggle for separation of
church and state was a long and
difficult one. In the schools for
example, each colonial church
group had its school, and religion
constituted a large part of the cur-
riculum. This is easily understood,
for in colonial times a large part
of all literature was of a religious
or Biblical nature.

After the colonies became more
thickly settled, however, this re-
ligious control over schools result-
ed in disorganization in the edu-
cational systems. Each school had
different standards and methods
of teaching.

Our state constitution guarantees
that no sectarian teaching shall be
conducted in the schools, and that
school money shall not be used for
this purpose. This is actually a
means of securing freedom of wor-
ship.

The Champaign question, there-
fore, is not a new problem, but
merely the old question of religion
in government, and in previous ex-
perience it has been shown that it
won’t work.

functions as any other branch of
the Communist Party.” Student
organizations are required to reg-
ister with the Office of Dean of
Students under University regula-
tions, and as of yesterday the
Communists had not filed applica-
tion for recognition.

Miss Saroff charged THE MA-
ROON with “yellow journalism”
in its story on the Communist
Club last week, and said that the
“paper’s bias in the article . . .
seriously endangers its slogan of
service and leadership.”
