Spikes Rumor That Raise
Means 'School For Rich'

Assertions that the 10 percent
tuition boost will convert the
University into a “playboy’s
rich man’s school” were vigor-
ously denied yesterday by Presi-
dent Robert M. Hutchins in an
interview with the editors of
The Chicago Maroon.

Hutchins punctured the rumor
by declaring that the raise would
be “more than offset” by the in-
creased scholarship grants and by
noting that “Chicago rates are
comparatively lower” than those
of most American privately en-
dowed universities. Such small
institutions as Ripon, Haverford,
Beloit, and Carleton maintain
tuition rates equivalent to those
now levied on Chicago students.

The president told the Maroon
heads that the tuition increase was
employed only as a final alternative
when the spectre of decreased gov-
ernment expenditures and a steadily
increasing deficit became apparent.

Hutchins explained the $20 “Uni-
versity fee” will be earmarked for no
special purpose but will be allocated
to the general University fund. Un-
der this arrangement special schools
of the University will contribute pro-

portionately
penditures.

Students
courses will

to general overall ex-

taking only part-time
also pay the fee, bring-

ing about further equalization.

Asked whether gifts might not
efface the deficit, the university pres-
ident said that the largest share of
the gifts received have been marked
for some special purpose and make
possible only a function not now
maintained by the University. Hutch-
ins added that the meteoric raise of
the University could be attributed to
the $35 million donations given the
University by oil tycoon John D.

New Figure Becomes
Effective By Fall;

Reconversion Cause

By ABE KRASH and ALAN STRAUSS

A general ten per cent tuition increase, the first in 18 years,
coupled with establishment of a $20 University fee, was yesterday
authorized by the Board of Trustees to cope with steadily dwindling
government contracts and reconversion expenditures which next
year are expected to soar past the half million dollar mark.

President Robert Maynard Hutchins, who released the in-
crease announcement, disclosed that the general 22.6 per cent
increase in student fees and tuition, to become effective with the
fall quarter, will contribute a gross $500,000 to the support of the

War veterans attending the University under the GI bill provisions
will not be affected by the tuition increase, it was learned last night.
$500 is alloted for three quarter and $667 for a full year to GI students
while the total tuition and fees for four quarters will now total $520.

University’s 1945-46 11 million dollar general budget. The Chicago
student body will pour a total of $3,089>000 into University coffers
as a result of the increase and an anticipated 15 per cent spurt in
attendance.

Hutchins said the increase was a direct result of a deficit for
next year’s operations computed in budget estimates submitted
to the Board of Trustees. He emphasized that a deficit total-
ling between $250,000 and $400,000 will remain even after the
increase in student fee income. The shortage will be paid out *of
University reserves or via gifts, the president disclosed.

Simultaneously, Dean of-Students Lawence A. Kimpton an-
nounced that student aid next year will total over $539,000, pro-
viding an increase of 37.8 per cent in all forms of fellowship and
scholarship aid. The scholarship increase will alleviate any hard-
ships resulting from the tuition increase, according to Kimpton.

Tuition charges for students in the College, Divisions, and
Schools, except Law and Medicine, will be lofted to $110 per
quarter plus the $20 fee. The fee, Hutchins explained, will
replace all current “nuisance assessments” except late penal-
ties, library fines, and laboratory breakage deposits. Health
and registration fees, laboratory course fees, and all gradua-
tion assessments, including the binding fee for these, will be
eliminated under the new arrangement.

The new $130 total represents, in comparison with the current

Scholarships Hiked to Half Million Mark

New Business,

By Barbara Holdsheim

The appointments of Ralph A. Beals
as dean of the Graduate Library
School and of Garfield V. Cox as dean
of the School of Business of the Uni-
versity of Chicago were announced
this week by President Robert Hut-
chins.

Beals will succeed Carleton A.

to become professor in the School

An acknowledged leader and author
of several studies in the field of adult
education, Ralph A. Beals came to
the University of Chicago on Oct. 1,
1942, as professor of library sciences
and director of the library.

In addition to assuming his new du-
ties, Beals will continue as professor
of library science and director of the
University Library.

Nearly two thousand University of Chicago students will
share over half a million dollars in scholarship funds to be awarded

in the 1945-46 academic year.

A 38 per cent boost in the stipends
available for scholarships was dis-
closed concurrently this week with the
10 per cent hike in tuition which has
been sanctioned by the University
Board of Trustees. Dean Lawrence A.
Kimpton announced last night that
Chicago will subsidize its students
with $539,000 next year as compared
to the current figure of $387,500.

Kimpton said the increase was
a double-barreled measure in that
it will partially offset the tuition
boost and is in keeping with the
University policy of constant ex-
pansion of scholarship funds.

All scholarships now charged to
general University funds—a majority
of all those available—will be auto-
matically increased 10 per cent to
cover the increased tuition costs,
Kimpton said. A full scholarship will
now total $110 per quarter, instead
of the present $100. Kimpton pointed
out, however, that the scholarships
will not include the new University
fee of $20 per quarter, also scheduled
to become effective in the fall.

Kimpton also noted than $250,000
is now available in student loans at a
5 per cent interest rate. Loans are

made from these funds for a one year
period with renewal privileges for an-
other four years. Loans outstanding
at this time, Kimpton said, amount to
only half of the total available.

The Maroon Will

Publish Letters

To The Editor'

In consonance with its avowed pol_
icy of representing student opinion,
the news columns of The Chicago Ma-
roon are open to student comments in
the form of “Letters to The Editor.”

The Maroon invites the campus to
submit letters of general campuswidq
interest.

All letters should be addressed to
“Letters to the Editor,” The Chicago
Maroon. All letters should be limited
to 300 words when possible. All let-
ters must be signed, although writers’
names will be withheld upon request.

The Maroon reserves the right to
.publish or reject any letters.

Tuitions Here

By Comparison

The University’s new tuition
rates, which will become effective
next autumn, compare favorably
to those of other major American
privately-endowed universities, a
survey conducted by “The Chica-
go Maroon” brought to light yes-
terday.

Chicago’s new tuition and fees have
been pegged at $390 per year, or $130
per quarter, an increase of 22.5 per
cent, except in the law and medical
schools. The Chicago total has lagged
behind other major institutions, how-
ever in accordance with education
policies framed by the University’s
founders. The new sum, the survey
revealed, is still short of figures quot-
ed by other private institutions.

Harvard assesses its students $400
for two semesters in addition to $20
fees, a total oi $420. Columbia
charges a total of $420, which is
broken down into $380 and $40 in
fees. The Northwestern total is cur-
rently pegged at $400, while Yale

Scoring a grand slam by winning

of Wisconsin won the 1945 Western
Conference debate championship at
Northwestern last week.

The University of Chicago trailed
the 8-school field in losing the title
it shared a year ago with Iowa and
Indiana. Iowa and Purdue tied for
second this time.

Chicago panelists, however, tied
with Northwestern for top honors
in the discussion phase of the meet
by scoring three excellents and a
superior. Both discussion and de-
bate topics focused attention on post-
war Germany.

Robert Voas and Phillip Nyemeyer
represented the Chicago affirmative
and Abe Krash and Bill Sparks up-
held the negative. The four debaters
were joined by Albert Friedlander,
Eugene Anderson, and Curt Craw-
ford in the discussion panels.

Chicago Professor
Cited By Stimson

Dr. Samuel A. Stouffer, Professor
of Sociology at the University, was
cited this week by Secretary of War
Stimson for “exceptional civilian serv-

University with the War Department
as chief social science analyst, is head
of the group of social science experts
gathered together by Major General
F. H. Osborn, Director, Information
and Education Division. The military
organization to which Dr. Stouffer
and his colleagues contribute their
technical knowledge conducts scien-
tific attitude studies of American sol-
diers throughout the world.

The citation pointed out Dr. Stouf-
fer’s “contribution to the War De-
partment and the nation in establish-
ing and developing attitude research
to the point where it is generally used
as a basis for planning procedures
and policies that have contributed
greatly to the morale of our armed
forces”.

Students who have been in resi-

Lawrence A. Kimpton, Dean of

Nine plans setting up the possible

A decline of interest in student or-

of 55 *at a meeting last Wednesday.
To facilitate communication with
those active in the formation of stu-

body at large a three-man publicity
committee, including Shirley Krum-

man Bill Washington.

“Perfection of liberal education and
the creation of a university com-
munity” were cited as aims toward
which student action should be di-
rected. Also stressed was the value
of activities being held in the first two
year men’s dormitories to make pos-
sible frequent informal communica-

closer contact with commuters and
to organize student life in terms of

were given.

Many felt that the film did not do
the story justice. It was loosely
constructed at times and the action
did not gain substance until the wind-
mill scene which was one of the high-
lights of the entire film. The photo-
graphy was excellent and the sound
background especially effective. The
very last scene, including the burn-
ing of the books and Don Quixotes’
death was also very well done. The
special lighting effects were par-
ticulary effective.

The little island of Saipan today has communications

Without this vast array of telephone, teletype and

Saipan could not play its key part as an army, navy and

Today the manpower and manufacturing facilities of

No Rich Man's School!

Although we believe the facts and figures fairly substantiate
the statements of the University regarding the necessity for the
current raise in tuition, we feel that the students, too, deserve
some consideration.- Since the most justifiable student complaints
will be from those whose future at the University may be jeopar-
dized by the increase in expense, we earnestly recommend that the
Administration consider how it may best safeguard the educa-
tional opportunities for such students. Remembering, of course,
that this is still a private institution, and as such is dependent
entirely upon tuition and gifts for its income, it is, nevertheless,
within the power of the Administration and the Board of Trustees
to make it possible for a larger number of capable, though finan-
cially handicapped students to continue to attend the University.

Need, a Criterion

There are several ways of accomplishing this end, one of which
would be to stress the criterion of financial need in the granting
of scholarships, instead of scholastic excellence alone. In such an
instance, all students who possess the necessary academic qual-
ifications would receive scholarships, but those people who could
not demonstrate need would receive an “honorary” scholarship;
i.e. a certificate in recognition of their achievements to replace
the regular cash disbursement of the scholarship.

A Sliding Scale

Another consideration which would probably necessitate a
major change in policy governing the granting of scholarship
awards and which would go far to equate financial differences
among students, would be the institution of a sliding scale for
scholarship disbursements. In this fashion, the academically
qualified student could receive as little as $10.00 per quarter or
even an amount in excess of tuition, depending entirely on his
individual financial requirements. For some students, the margin
of aid necessary to remain at school may be somewhat less than
full tuition

Transfer of Loan Funds

Furthermore, to increase the total number of scholarships
granted, it may be possible to transfer some of the cash now being
held by the various loan funds to the general scholarship fund.
According to the latest figures, there are more loan funds on hand
than calls for student loans. In those cases where the money has
been given to the University under specific restrictions by the
donor, it may be possible to suggest to the donor that the terms be
changed to allow for the investment of such funds so that at least
the income yielded could be used for scholarship purposes.

In this manner, the increased number of scholarships could
assist a greater number of needy students; the “honorary”
scholarships could sufficiently recognize the superior achievement
of that student whose parents’ or whose own financial resources
were ample to pay for his complete education; and finally the
sliding scale would materially equalize educational opportunity for
the capable, but economically handicapped student. We, of course,
recognize that these changes would greatly increase the complexity
of administering scholarship policy; yet, we are convinced that
the greater benefit accruing to the student body would more than
compensate for the additional difficulty.

A Moral Obligation

As a final thought, each scholarship should carry with it a
gentlemen’s agreement so that after a recipient graduated from
the University and became sufficiently well established financially,
he would endeavor to repay to the University the amount of the
scholarship. This need not be a legal obligation. Rather, it
should be considered a moral obligation so that some other deserv-
ing student could receive the same material assistance towards
his education as the original holder of the University award,
remembering, too, that even full tuition pays no more than % of
the cost of his education at this University.

Letters to Editor

Campus Poet
Raps Critic;
Defends Self

To the Editor:

Re that “More for Measure” column
of last week:

“Some are bewildered in the maze of
schools,

And some made coxcombs Nature
meant but fools,

In search of wit these lose their com-
mon sense,

And then turn Critics in their own
. defence:^

—Pope

I should not stoop to answer your
Neo-Zoilus except that he has used
my poem as a soapbox for his youth-
ful mouthings. To be misunderstood
by bad critics is to be expected; to be
used as an excuse for pseudo-platonic
evolutionary interpretation is intol-
erable. Since his attack has been
largely personal, I do not feel it un-
fair to examine the “psyche” of this
scribbler. He has two prominent de-
ficiencies, a lack both of taste and a
proper historical perspective. To these
failures of intellectual equipment, he
has added an inability to read except
in the light of his own being. „

His historical sense is faulty to
be certain. The “conscious contempla-
tion” of any object, “poetic” or not,
existed long before the 19th Century.
This is therefore a traditional, rather
than a period piece. However, the
limited knowledge of your scribbler
would force him to brand this “archa-
ic” as he has my use of “the valid
sonnet form.” Evidently he has not
heard of tradition nor even of change
and contrast in poetry else he should
not have offered such a criticism as
“alternately compressed and diluted,
modern in image and archaic in
form.” With “traditional” substituted
for “archaic” this becomes praise, for
it is manner alone that we are “mod-
ern.” (Vide: MacNeice’s use of the
pastoral, Hopkin’s, Cummings’ use of
the sonnet, O’Neill’s and Jeffers’ use
of the Greek tragedy.) The contrast
which is used in both language and
image is in keeping with the basic
analogy of the poem which he has
chosen to ignore. As for the title, “be-
tween the connotation and the deno-
tation falls the Reality” and the real-
ity is that the Hellbender 'mystics’
apriori feelings to the contrary” is
still a weak, low, half evolved, present
day salamander unable to cope suc-
cessfully with any environment. I
should question the adoration of them
for their sacrifices on the altar of
the “Greater Good” (Oh blessed be
their leaky hearts!) if it had any-
thing to do with the poem. He has
suggested that I get my philosophy
in order. I suggest he get his phi-
losophy the hell out of my poetry!

I could continue in this vein, but I
feel it is more effective to quote the
wonderful Jabberwocky of his psy-
choanalysis :

“We can damn him where we can-
not damn the salamander, for the sal-
amander must be reverenced as a no-
ble ghost. Harmon is not yet noble,
but he is not a ghost. He is a force,
still to fulfill its* function.” For this
revelation (especially that this frame
is more than an ectoplasm to which
he has reduced the still living Hell-
bender) I shall be eternally grateful.

Servin' It Hot

Last Sunday afternoon’s jam ses-
sion at the Club Zanzibar was can-
celled on last minute notice. How-
ever we are assured the sessions will
go back on schedule this Sunday, and
while the complete lineup hasn’t been
released Jay C. Higginbotham is still
definitely set on trombone, backed by
a modern band.

Bud Jacobson’s Chicago jazzmen
of March 4 came off even more suc-
cessfully than Phil’s first presenta-
tion. The band stand was shifted to
the middle of the room, with the
spectators circled around it, result-
ing in an even more relaxed, informal
atmosphere. It certainly encouraged
greater audience participation in the
spirit of the thing. The Jungle Kings
impressed me as more unified in play-
ing and feeling than the Richard M.
Jones group, presenting a more clean
cut, well knit style. The musicians
were very well balanced, especially in
the ensembles, which were truly of the
rough and ready Chicago vein. It was
much harder to pick out a few out-
standing individuals as was the case of
the first session. Comment at random
would be that Bud’s clarinet came off
fine and it was good to hear Warren
Smith’s Dixieland trombone again. I
was very happy, too, to hear Tut
Soper in really fine shape, and to
note the audience’s response to his
solo rendition of James P. Johnson’s
rhapsody Yamakraw.

I think it would be of great interest
to add that this band is available
for some appropriate date on the U.
of C. campus. A Saturday afternoon
jam session with dancing if desired,
would be a likely presentation. All
that’s needed is the appearance of
some campus organization to spon-
sor the affair, or at least enough in-
dication of interest from students to
warrant individuals undertaking the
presentation. What do I hear?

Sloan Craftsmanship Superb But
He’s Not a Genius, Avers Critic

By Betsy Nan Harmon

The exhibition of John Sloan’s etchings has closed, but during
the past month many of us have reverently tip-toed into the
Goodspeed Hall Art Gallery to view the work of this famous
American artist. Many tip-toed out again, duly impressed and
satisfied that they had undergone some kind of aesthetic experience
because, after all, hadn’t they seen the etchings of THE John Sloan?

Others of us lingered, however, per-
haps hesitating to admit that what
we saw there may have been expert
craftsmanship, but certainly it was
not artistic genius.

Of the critics who think him great,
many believe this greatness to lie in
his true Americanism. As Miss Dor-
othy Grafly puts it, he “. . . stands to-
day as one of the country’s foremost
painters, his American art integrity
unimpaired by European influences.”
This seems, though, to be more of
a condemnation than praise, for
can a self-conscious national art dis-
place universal art which draws its
power and understanding from the
growth of tradition? Each country
and age has contributed to this artistic
evolution and each artist must take
his place in the whole movement; he
must draw from the past and inter-
pret his findings in terms of the pres-
ent.

Technically, he has complete con-
trol of his medium and it is obvious
that there is no element of chance in
the effect he tries to achieve. The
compositional and plastic qualities
show acceptable academic form. But
again, I question the merit of the
effect he has tried to achieve.

The graphic medium lends itself,

especially, becomes so absorbed in su-
perficial decorations that the struc-

whole is weakened.

He says of his own technique, “Most
painters are content with the visual
peelings, but I have thrown away the
peelings and prefer to deal with the
thing itself. Then when I have fin-
ished with the thing itself, I add my
own peelings.” It seems to me though,
that he got lost in his pile of peelings
and the result may just be another
case of not being able to see the
woods because of the trees.

On the same subject, Mr. H. Bos-
well McBride says, “That cross-
hatching and tatooing with which he
crochets the model, function neither
as line, nor form, nor light, nor as
broken color; it is, rather, a mere-
tricious device to camouflage the art-
ist’s appalling banality . . . This es-
sential banality is even more appar-
ent in the passionless routine with
which he approaches a wide variety
of subjects. Whether it is a studio
nude, a Sante Fe landscape or a stale
satire, it bears a faint odor of decay,
behind it all yawns the tired bour-
geois.”

Greater Influence Seen
For University Presses

By Joan Kohn

“A university press should be a carrier of scholarship, pri-
marily of the university but also of scholarship all over the world.
Secondly, it should interpret problems of scholarship for the adult
reader.” These are the views of Joseph A. Brandt, Director of
the University of Chigao Press.

Acclaim Two
Artists Here

Following the playing of the Mozart
“D Major Sonata”, closing number on
last Friday’s Chamber Concert, a
wildly enthusiastic audience brought
back Alexander Schneider, violinist
and Ralph Kirkpatrick, harpsichordist

Mr. Brandt believes that the role
of the university press in the future
development of American culture
should be increasingly great. It is
the book that is first in the service
of keeping freedom alive. It is the
role of the university presses to com-
bat the threat of growing intolerance,
due to lack of knowledge and under-
standing, by bringing ‘‘light to the,
dark places which mark our social
frontier.”

Geisha Gazette:
It's ASTP Paper
On Quadrangles

Volume one, number one of THE
GEISHA GAZETTE, a newspaper
published by the enlisted men of
the ASTP language units stationed
at the University of Chicago, was
born on March 9, 1945.

The title was chosen by vote be-
cause of its alliterative qualities
but the army chooses to keep the
meaning of “GEISHA” a military
secret. The four pages in its first
edition include news and features
of interest to the company and to
their families and friends at home,
a Japanese crossword puzzle, and
a comic strip by Pvt. Morty Mil-
ler, entitled “Destination Tokyo!”

THE GEISHA GAZETTE will

for six curtain calls. The pleased per-
formers then played an encore, a
“rondo” from a third Mozart sonata.

The acclaim was well deserved.
Both Mr. Kirkpatrick and Mr. Schnei-
der exhibit the highest mastery in
technical skill. But this is not the
primary excellence in their playing.
It is rather to be found in that com-
plete perfection of ensemble which is
the ultimate in the art of chamber
music interpretation.

The program was such as to make
at least one musically-minded person
groan that the music department was
becoming too intellectual. The first
half consisted of Sonata No. 7 by
Biber, the Bach 3rd Sonata and Moz-
art’s Sonata, C Major, Kochel No. 396.
In the Bach, the two demonstrated
fully that beauties in all works are
not to be found in an over-emotional
“schmaltzy” treatment. Pure, beau-
tiful phrasing coupled with a deli-
cate sense of dynamics and unwaver-
ing tempo produced a result which
must have been beyond Bach’s
dreams; for in comparison with others
of his works, the 3rd sonata is not
outstanding.

Following the intermission were
Ritratta dell Amore, by Couperin,
and the already mentioned Mozart
Sonata in D Major, Kochel No. 306.
The Couperin work is a series of eight
movements with descriptive French

Evidence of the merit of these prin-
ciples lies in the receipt of the an-
nual Carey Thomas Award for
Greater Publishing, conferred upon
the Press in 1944.

A great monument to these ideals
stands in Friederich A. Hayek’s The
Rdad to Serfdom, published by the
Press in 1944. Proclaimed “one of
the most important books of our gen-
eration,” its sales have passed the
30,000 mark and have set a new rec-
ord for the Press. This epic book,
which “restates for our time the issue
between liberty and authority with
the power and rigor of reasoning,”
has attracted world-wide attention.

The Volume is now going into its
seventh printing and after its ap-
pearance in condensed form as the
lead article in the April issue of
Reader’s Digest, it may go through
many more. Having already broken
its tradition by proceeding the article
with a testimonial to the book, the
Digest will continue with a series
of comments by prominent people in
the May issue. This book is indeed
a “merchant of light.”

Hayek, incidentally, will lecture at
the University in the very near fu-
ture.

Freedom is More Than a Word, by
Marshall Field, is already creating
widespread interest, although its pub-
lication date is ! still over a month

titles.

After an evening of early sonatas,
the D Major, which bears close affini-
ties with Beethoven, was a thrilling
close.

The keyboard instrument domin-
ated the performance throughout, cul-
minating in a full cadenza in the last
movement. The performers gave a
freer, warmer interpretation to this
work, as was warranted by the style.

In their fine performance the two
artists gave us insight into the pos-
sibilities offered in their particular
tonal medium. The harpsichord and
violin blended almost to the point of
sounding like one instrument. The
over brilliance of the piano is lack-
ing; the harpsichord in Mr. Kirkpat-
rick’s hands is not just a predecessor
of the modern piano. It has its own
range of dynamic and varieties of
tone color; in the latter respect, ex-
ceeding the piano. Special praise
should be given to Mr. Schneider for
his amazing skill in producing a soft,
flexible and yet very warm tone which
adapted itself to the harpsichord
remarkably well. All the slight un-
sureness which marked the opening
portions of Mr. Schneider’s perform-
ance with his Albeneri Trio some
weeks ago, was gone; the longer as-
sociation of these men may explain
their higher quality of musicianship
than the Trio. —S. G.

away. Advance sales are the largest
in the history of the Press, amounting
to almost 12,000 copies. This book,
by one of America’s foremost liberals,
is another step toward Brandt’s aim
“of making the printed page the uni-
versity of every man!”

Faculty Gives
"How to Study"
Lecture Series

To aid students in the College, par-

group, Alpha Phi Omega, national
service fraternity, is sponsoring a
lecture series entitled “How to
Study,” consisting of six fifteen-
minute lectures by members of the
College faculty, followed by short
discussion sections.

This afternoon’s lectures will be
given by Theodore Ashford, Physical
Sciences, and Benson Ginsberg, Bio-
logical Sciences, in a session at
Oriental Institute beginning at 3 p.m.
The concluding lectures will be de-
livered Monday by Chester Cable of
the English staff and Clarence Faust,
Dean of the College at the same time

Maynard Krueger, Social Sciences,
and Russell Thomas, Humanities,
opened the series Wednesday
afternoon.

Sidelights on Footlights

Last Friday’s experimental theatre production of “Minikin and Manikin”
and “The Stronger” was in many ways far superior to the group’s former
performances—“The Astonished Heart” or “Phometheus Bound”. By con-
sidering such things as choice of play, execution, criticisms, and finally audi-
ence, we ought to be able to trace recent progress.

When considering the character of the questions presented by “Minikin
and Manikin”, puppet-like postures and timing, admittedly, they were rec-
ognized as such, if not completely encompassed. Mr. Edwards, by far the
most searching critic yet heard, praised both Sonia Friedman and Sid Burks
for their work in the Kreymburg piece, remarking on the weak points and
offering suggestions for improvement. Inasmuch as “The Stronger” calls
for a monologuist as well as a pantominist/inquiring into the adequacy of
each would be vast work. But it wouldn’t be fair to either Jean Cooke or
Roberta Unger to say merely that they did very well. They did some things
well and other things not so well, but what’s more important is that they
were able to deliver a sizeable impact because of a thorough knowledge of
Strindberg and what he was trying to do.

“Prometheus Bound”, planned by Robert Carter, was treated with over-
whelming grace by its guest critics, David Grene, Tennessee Williams, and
Jere Mickel. As an attempt at stylizing an appalingly difficult drama, it
was admirable. To talk about the performance as having met with all the
problems posed would be absurd, because half were not realized in the short
time in which it was prepared. Thus I say the critics were gracious, ap-
plauding the actors and the impression made, rather than speaking in terms
of what was done to Aeschylus.

The President is a confirmed chain pipe smoker: on his desk
he has a row of pipes which he fills, one by one, smokes halfway,
and then starts on the next one. We note from the Times that
Maude is over at Lying-In for a rest. One of our friends went
over to see one of the vice presidents the other day; while he was
waiting in the President’s office he took up a newspaper to spend
his time profitably—suddenly Hutchins poked his head out the
door and chided, “This isn’t the men’s lounge, you know.”
Shortage Acute?

Last Friday we saw two of our so-called sweet young things wandering
casually into the College Library smoking enormous stogies. At least two
people looked at them solicitously and offered them cigarettes if they were
really THAT needy. (Incidentally, the same two gave a repeat performance
Tuesday night at the Documentary Film.) Not even a mild sensation re-
sulted in the library through—habitues dismissed it as “just one of those
things that goes on at the University of Chicago.”

The doctors at Student Health have their hands full with the entire
campus running over there to see what can be done about their spring fever—
and why not? Nova Scotia and sundry females have been parading across
the quadrangles in bare feet; the usual quota of loafers are studying (euphe-
mism for sleeping) under the trees while fond couples coo at each other on
the grass. By the way, a chance remark overheard at student health presents
an interesting problem: “Why not control birth control?”

Congratulations

To the newly elected club presidents: Pi Delt’s June Arnold, Chi Rho’s

Corky Glasner, M.B.’s Louise Harvey, Tau Sig’s Erma Kallen, Wyvern’s Dor-
othy Klein, and Delta Sig’s Irene McEnroe. .We just haven’t the names of
other new presidents—but they get bouquets too.

Sports Section

The Big Ten track meet at the Field House Saturday night provided
much fodder for thought We’re still wondering what some people think a
track meet is; there were at least three females with men (appropriately
clad in sports clothes) who were dressed to the skin of their teeth with inches
of makeup, hair piled high on their heads, spike heels, and otherwise dressed
for a night at the opera. Two of these well-dressed women discovered in the
middle of the meet that they were bored and flounced off to U.T. with their
ostrich feathers bravely waving.

Life History

We noticed in the University of Minnesota Daily that the origin of the
little ditty about one meatball has been discovered: it seems that a shy and.
mild Harvard professor went out one night to an eatery and since he wasn’t
very hungry ordered one meatball. When he complained about having re-
ceived no bread, the waiter (a tough one) replied, “We don’t serve no bread
with one meatbail.” The professor never quite forgot the incident—it had
seared his tender soul—and one day he wrote the song. In connection with
the song, we found an old song book of the 1890’s where the subject was the
lone fishball.

Saturday Night Doings

After the C Dance, an energetic group of musically-minded students
serenaded the President; after B & G chased them away, they proceeded to
the Circle, sang for a while, and then started to practice their screams. The
screams aroused the girls at Blake (who had been sleeping none too se-
curely because someone had been tampering with the locks on the fire-escape
doors) who had a bad half hour of it hanging out of the windows and ex-
horting the ever-present B & G men to search Cobb Hall.

Military Movie-Goers

Just another sign of spring was the group of rather portly majors and
colonels we saw running along the Midway and up the steps of International
House bellowing at the top of their lungs, “CHARGE!”

Rockefeller which were entirely unre-

The president said that the steady
decline in interest rates has slashed
endowment funds since 1929 to the
current mark of 4 per cent and is
equivalent to a loss of one third of the
endowment funds.

Two costs not included in current
budget estimates may raise the defi-
cit still further, Hutchins said in the
exclusive interview. Possible exten-
sion of social security legislation, fa-
vored by the University, would re-
sult in an increased outlay by the
University of more than $300,000.
Faculty members now on leave are
also returning from government serv-
ice and their contract payments will
be resumed by the university.

Hutchins said it was unlikely
that tuition will be reduced after
the war when a larger enrollment
is expected because of the steadi-
ly rising costs of operation. He
said that the 10 per cent increase
would reduce the deficit only if
an expected 15 per cent registra-
tion increase materializes.

$100 tuition, $3 health, and $3 registration fee, an overall increase
of 22.6 per cent.

Since present laboratory fees are cancelled, the increase for
students with laboratory courses will be somewhat smaller; for
College students with one laboratory course per quarter, it will
amount to 19.3 per cent, while for divisional students with a
similiar program, it will total 17.1 per cent.

The current law school assessment of $131 has been
upped to a total of $157.50 per quarter. The medical school
increase has been set at 18.6 per cent, computed on the basis of
a present assessment total of $156 and the new total of $185.

The percentage figures listed, however, are slightly higher
than the real increases, since they are computed on a quarterly
basis, and do not take into account the cancellation of the gradua-
tion fees.

Items that will increase the University’s expenses in 1945-46
will include $97,000 in salaries for newly appointed faculty mem-
bers and $118,000 in salary increases to current professors.
$465,000 will be required to cover the “reconversion” costs which
will accrue during the fiscal year from June 30 of this year to
June 30, 1946. This total is broken down into $177,000 to be paid
in salaries to faculty members, at present on leave from the
University for government service, who will be returning to the
payroll, and an additional $288,000 will be needed to finance plant
operation and overhead expenses which are now paid by the
government under the terms of its contracts with the University.
These expenses will revert to the University with the cancellation
of the wartime program. Government contracts for next year
will amount to $10,500,000, a decrease of $6,750,000 from last
year’s peak of $17,250,000.

Michigan Clips Illinois

To Win

It was a night of many firsts
here at the University Field-
house when all of the strength
of the Western Conference
clashed in the annual Big Ten
Indoor trackmeet last Saturday.
Michigan’s power loaded Wolver-
ines edged the challenging Illini,
55 1/10 to 54 1/10 in a see-saw
meet which was in doubt up until
the final pole vault.

Michigan became the first school
in the conference to win more than
100 titles in total league competi-
tion. It was the Michigan indoor
squad’s third consceutive title and
the Wolverines have now dominated
Big Ten indoor track for 10 seasons
out of the past 12.

Big 10 Crown

as Illinois did and still go down
in defeat. Scoring 37 points in
the distance events alone, Michi-
gan slammed the mile, unique in
the 35 year history of the meet,
and then went on to take second,
third, fourth and fifth behind
Illinois* Bob Kelley in the 880
and first, second and third in the
two mile. It was that block of 37
points which contributed greatly
towards the Wolverine’s retain-
ing their crown.

Two Records Toppled As U. High
Swimmers Capture Seventh Title

The University High Swimming Team broke two records and
tied another on Friday as it successfully defended its Private
School League championship at Bartlett pool. The U High Team
has captured the title for the seventh time in the history of the
Private School League.

Illinois Takes 7 First

In the line of an unusual first,
it was believed that one team
had never compiled 7 first places

Form held good in all events ex-
cept the high jump, Badger Bill Bach-
man upsetting Armin Bauman of
Minnesota with a leap of 6 feet 2
inches. Ross and Bob Hume ran a
dead heat in the mile as per schedule
to win the mile championship for the
second year and Bob Kelley, ace Ne-
gro middle distance man from Illi-
nois, won the quarter and half and

Buster Wins 60

Orange and Blue man Buzz
boy Buster won the 60 yard dash
while Illinois could also claim
the only other double winner of
the night beside Kelley in George
Walker, freshman hurdler, who
topped the high and low boards
in good time. Witherspoon of
Michigan chased Buster home in
the 60, trailing by half a foot in
:06.4 as did Michigan’s Forrestal
and Barnard in the 440 and 880
behind Kelley.

Bob Petty, who became the meet’s
only*two-event winner by taking the
40 and 100 yard freestyle events, tied

third with 21. Chicago Latin made 12
points, followed by North Park Acad-

From Twilight to Midnight

Minnesota took third place behind
the Wolves and Illini, with Ohio Sthte,
Purdue, Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin
scoring points in that order. Both
Northwestern University and the Uni-
versity of Chicago failed to qualify
or place men in the meet.

Installment II of the Fairy
Story:

Well we received quite a
reaction to last week’s column.
The people who agreed with us
were the ones we expected to
agree. And the people to whom
the article was directed, ignored
it. We’ll let things ride for a
while now. But look at the story
and ignore the language which
was so terribly shocking. Maybe
it will take on a different light.
More later ....

To get on to a little safer ice, the
Big Ten meet at the Fieldhouse was
run off in beautiful style. With the
exception of the announcer, who
sounded like Pollyanna, there weren’t
any grounds for complaint. Split sec-
ond timing and some very good efforts

Wilson Named
Big Ten Head

K. L. “Tug” Wilson, former Illi-
nois football star and director of
athletics at Northwestern Univer-
sity, was named Big Ten athletic
commissioner by a meeting of the
faculty directors of the Western Con-
ference in a recent meeting. Wilson
has had nearly 30 years of experience
in athletics dating back to his partici-
pation in the 1920 Olympic games.

The new commissioner replaces the
late Major John A. Griffith, Big Ten
czar for many years. Wilson has
signed a contract for six years at
$15,000 a year, a substantial increase
over the former czar’s salary. Dean
Lawrence Kimpton represented the
University of Chicago at the faculty
director meeting of the Western
Conference of which Chicago is still
an official member.

kept the meet moving
crowd interested.

. We talked to the
winner in the high

and kept the

third place
hurdles, an

Ohio State boy named Bill Sie-
bert, who was very compliment-
ary when he spoke of the Field-
house. He said it was the best
track and house he’d competed
in this year. Catching Illinois*
Bob Kelley on the run, no small
feat in itself, proved to give the
same reaction. Kelly really likes
the Fieldhouse track. And finally
we talked to those fabuous twins
from Michigan, the Hume Boys.
Again we got the same answer,
“The floor is great.” All of which
is very fine but Chicago stilt
didn’t place. But neither did
Northwestern. So we weren’t left
out in the cold.

With the weather being as it is
today, we can’t pass up commenting
on the activity on the Midway in
front of Ida. Baseballs are flying and
young love is rife. But we should on-
ly comment on the baseball. There’s
a heated argument in the making
about Hal Patinkin’s hitting. One side
says he hasn’t hit the ball more than
300 feet, the other side claims Patink
has rapped out a 400 foot drive. All
of which is very well except that Pa-
tinkin is backing up the 400 foot
bunch.

Maroons Rank 3rd
In All-Time Rating

Following the Big Ten Indoor track
meet and the Conference swimming
meet last Saturday, a compilation of
total aggregate Western conference
championship show that while Chi-
cago has dropped Big Ten participa-
tion in nearly all branches of athle-
tics, the Maroons still hold third place
with 69 individual team crowns. Mich-
igan set a new record over the week-



end, running their totals to 101, while
Illinois followed them with 91. Chi-
cago is apparently secure in third
position for some time as its nearest
challenger, Minnesota, can claim only
40 such titles.
