House.

The Red Cross booths, in charge of
the club women, netted $313.66.
$151.00 of that amount are new

individual contributions and $17.50
from the Red Cross boxes.

Estimates on pledges not yet re-
ceived are $300.00 for International
House, $75.00 for Foster Hall and
$30.00 for Gates which means that
final totals AviH exceed the $1000
mark.

Lenz to Lead Combined Staffs

Phoenix, new campus magazine, and Tempus (formerly
Carillon) merged in a suprise move last Wednesday, March 27.
The merger was an indirect result of a suggestion by Mortimer
Adler, who, together with Dean Kimpton, attended a meeting of
the staffs of the two publications at the Burton Court lounge.
The meeting was originally called to smooth out difficulties between
the two publications, and to insure co-operation between them.

Social Action
Conference Set

Final arrangements for the coming
Conference on the Bases of Social Ac-
tion were made yesterday at a meet-
ing of the sponsoring committee. The
conference, which will be held on
campus from April 8th to 15th, will
provide an opportunity for campus-
wide discussion and analysis of un-
derlying reasons and motivations be-
hind social and political action.

The conference is to be built around
meetings in various campus organiza-
tions. These groups will have com-

War Stamp Ball
At Int House
April Seventh

In preparation for the War
Stamp Ball, to be held at Interna-
tional House Theatre on Saturday,
April 7, a Blind Date Bureau has
been set up in Mandel corridor.
Both the Ball itself and the Bu-
reau are sponsored by the War
Stamp Committee.

The Bureau will be open from 11:30
to 1:30, Monday through Friday, until
April 7, for the convenience of those
not well acquainted on campus.

During the past two weeks- the Bu-
reau has been doing a brisk business,
selling bids, as well as signing up
lonely fellows and girls. Price of the
bids is $1.75 per couple. This includes
I the purchase of two 25c war stamps.

One of the attractions of the dance,

The pros and cons of a merger were
brought out in discusssion, and both
staffs agreed that it would be of great
advantage to all concerned. The first
issue of Phoenix will hit the news
stands on campus in a few days, but
will not be a combination of the two
magazines. Succeeding copies will
probably also bear the name Phoenix,
but will include work of both staffs.
Bill Lenz, editor of Phoenix, will con-
tinue as editor of the combined groups.

at the dance, where the purchase of a
ten-cent war stamp will entitle the
purchaser to one vote.

working outside for the past several
days. The Maroon tennis team, com-
posed of last year’s number one man,
Glotzer and supported by Tully. Sha-
piro and Greenburg in that order, is
expected to make up one of the better
4-man squads in the Big Ten. There
are several other promising men prac-

make it possible for the University to
take part in both 4, 6 and 8 man
team competition with several Mid

6 Maroons To
Run In 47th
Annual CAAU

Playing host to the 47th annual
Central A.A.U. track meet at the
University of Chicago Fieldhouse,
Coach Ned Merriam has announced
his intention of entering a six man
squad tomorrow night at 7:30. Led
by Captain Paul Russell in the hurdle
events, the remaining men will prob-
ably include Bokman in the half mile,
Rust in the distances, Turtelotte in
the dashes and broad jump and two
other members of the track team
who have shown their capabilities
under fire. '

Maroons Place 2 Men

Coach Merriam and a nine man
team went to the North Central In-
vatational meet at Naperville last
Saturday and placed two men, one
in the hurdles and one in the mile.
Russell took a second in the high hur-
dles and Rust squeezed out a fifth
place in the 440. A s,coring Illinois
Tech team scored over 55 points to
win the meet with North Central
coming in second. The Maroons
placed eighth in a field of eleven teams.

Adding to the 13 competitive sen-
ior events, and Public high schools
from the city of Chicago will take
part in 3 half mile relay races. En-
tries in the meet are expected to
include many of the private clubs
in the city and central area and sev-
eral colleges and universities. Indiv-
idual entries will probably take up
a large part of the field also. The
meet is tomorrow night at 7:30 at
the Fieldhouse.

THE CHICAGO MAROON —

Jack HUI

Time In

InstallmentHI: The Fairy Tale

This week the fairy tale be-
gins to look less and less like a
fairy tale. Coupled with Kyle
Anderson’s good news on the
baseball schedule, the University
has announced that Chicago will
resume all classes of competition
familiar to the Western confer-
ence with one big exception,
football. Basketball, track, golf,
baseball and tennis will all be
reorganized with the definite
view in mind of taking part
against the other schools in the
conference.

So, it looks as if some of the
boys won’t be reduced to sitting
in Ida Noyes and knitting next
fall. It is our earnest belief, aside
from any ‘objectionable language’
that Chicago’s re-entry into real
competition will go a long way to-
ward making up for the definite
lack of unity which is now becom-
ing more and more apparent.

In baseball/things still aren’t set,
but the picture looks a lot brighter.
Anderson is doing his best to sche-
dule some crowd drawing games in
the belief that Chicago really has
something to work with on the field.
Now is only there will be more than
thirty people out for the first game
and is whoever does see the Maroons
play, win or lose, doesn’t get sarcastic,
things should go all right. This is
our first real chance to show that Chi-
cago won’t be the ‘weak sister’ you
hear so much about. Maybe in a year
or so, the sports writers of our nation’s
greatest newspaper will have to pick
on someone else. We hope.

Maroon Ball Club Will Meet

Northwestern, Purdue, Michigan

Responding to the University

announcement that after the war
is finished the Maroon colors will
return to all fields of Big Ten
competition except football
Coach J. Kyle Anderson, baseball
mentor, has announced that this
year’s ball club will engage sev-
eral Big Ten schools on the dia-

mond.

Games With Big Ten Schools

Anderson released a skeleton
roster which indicates games with
Northwestern and Purdue on a
home and home basis and the pos-
sibilities of games with other
Western conference teams. With
the schedule still in a nebulous
stage in connection with the Big
Ten, Anderson has successfully
arranged to meet Western Michi-
gan, Illinois Tech, Wheaton and
Concordia.

Progress on the practice field on
Greenwood avenue is proceeding in
good shape with a pitching staff of
five men, all working into shape and
an outfield which looks to be fairly
well set. Coach Anderson is expe-
rimenting with the infield at the pres-

ent time but Kurt Smith, newly ac-
quired third sackman, looks to be a
permanent fixture at the hot corner.

Going under fire for the first time
strong but untested Illinois Techawk
nine next Saturday, April 7, at the

Greenwood field. The game is sche-
duled to go at 2:30 and every man on
the squad has expressed his hopes
that the University will come out
and support what looks to be one of
the best athletic teams that Chicago
has seen for many years.

21 Teams Run In
Public School Meet
Twenty-one schools sent their top track
teams to the University Fieldhouse
last Saturday to compete for the junior
and senior indoor crown of the Public

League.

Schurz, senior division champs, and
Hyde Park, junior title holders, are
again making the other teams toe the
line this time by topping two of three
features.

Harry Lally’s triumph in the pole
vault gave Schurz’s four eighth’s edge
over their closest contender, Hyde
Park, in Tuesday’s preliminaries. Lal-
ly’s eleven feet was just two and a
half feet under Clark Shaughnessy,
Jr.’s all time record for the league.
Two other spectacular events were the
dash and the triple broad jump. Jim
Fuchs covered the sixty yeards in 0:6.4
and Milton Jaffe, of Sullivan, estab-
lished the only new mark in this jump
with a leap of 31 feet, 1% inches.

Softball League Meeting

Responding to the many requests
that an intramural softball league be
organized, the University athletic de-
partment has announced that there

will be an organizational meeting in
the near future. In the meantime
men wishing to practice can obtain
necessary equipment at the Bartlett
gymnasium cage and they will be al-
lowed to work out in Stagg field or
the Cottage Grove field.

Vocational Guidance Offers
Civil Service Positions

Senior women who are interested
in learning of highly confidential cleri-
cal and research jobs may have the
opportunity of doing so on Friday,
April 6 at the Board of Vocational
Guidance and Placement Office, Cobb
Hall 215. Lt. R. Y. Austin of the
U. S. Army Signal Corps will be
available on that day for interviews
with interested students. Appoint-
ments for interviews may be made
on or before April 5 with Miss Mar-
garet Fox, extension 391.

The duties of college graduates who
qualify as research aides will include
the analysis and interpretation of
classified military information. How-
ever, Lt. Austin has stressed the fact
that personal integrity, loyalty, and
unimpeachable character will be rated
above all other qualifications. Fa-
miliarity with research techniques is
of great value since considerable
study, reference work and project-
type assignments are involved in the
fulfillment of these positions. Suc-

This laboratory, ready to move anywhere on short
notice, runs down “crimes” against good tele-
phone service. Finding these threats is one of the
many jobs of the Bell Telephone Laboratories’
scientists.

The “criminals” are such things.as threads of
lint, traces of acids, or sulphur compounds in the
air—any of which might damage telephone equip-
ment.

In their interesting war work Bell Laboratories’
scientists have been on a new kind of hunt. They
have tracked down different materials for those
now hard to get, found others that would serve in
special.conditions, and have detected in captured
equipment the kinds of material the enemy uses.

These are some examples among many of the
ways Bell System research is helping to serve
America at war.

The Democratic Process

Throughout the history of The Chicago Maroon, yearly,
quarterly, weekly, even daily internal upheavals have occurred
with all too persistent regularity to the detriment of the paper and
the morale of its staff. Publishers have been placed and replaced,
editors have been in and out, Boards of Control have been made
and unmade, to say nothing of . the on-again-off-again quality of
the staff—with a frequency that makes Maroon history read like
a whirlwind. And behind all these appointments, seizures, and
manipulated elections has been the long arm of personal advance-
ment, guiding journalism—through campus politics and social
elites— up against a frowning Friday campus.

For the past year, under the stable editorship of Fred Gottes-
man who was able, as few editors have been in the past, to see Tris
way clear to putting aside his Bachelor of Arts to spend mornings
and nights with the Maroon, and with the understanding assistance
of Dean Kimpton, the Maroon staff pitched together, and for the
most part has done an excellent job. While a bewildering number
of improvements remain to be made, the total effort of the past
year has resulted in many positive benefits and the campus has
responded favorably.

Now, the editor’s battered chair is once again vacant. But
for the first time in nearly half a century of University of Chicago
journalism, politics has been subjugated to the fairness and square-
ness of a well regulated election closely adhering to the rules
stipulated by the constitution. For the first time in nearly half
a century democracy has come to The Chicago Maroon.

Regardless of the outcome of this election we point with pride
to the election itself. It seems to indicate that the Maroon has
planted a sound foundation on which to build a better, bigger
future.	... L. S.

Ethel Barrymore was doing “Be-
linda”, Nazimova, “A Doll’s House”.
Billie Burke and Henry Miller played
in “A Marriage of Convenience”, and
Al Jolson was appearing in “Sinbad”.

The year was 1918. In May of 1918
the Washington Square Players sub-
, stituted plays by Eugene O’Neill and
Susan Gaspell for a previously plan-
ned performance of “Salome”. The
O’Neill play, as you have guessed by
this time was “The Rope”, to be pre-
sented by the experimental theatre
group in April. Whitford Kane,
whom you’ll remember for his Bur-
bage in “Elizabeth the Queen”, and
his grave-digger in “Hamlet”, took
the part of Bentley. Robert Strange,
who has sold himself to the movies
recently, but who acted in “Mourning
Becomes Electra” and “Both Your
Houses” played Pat Sweeney.

The NEW YORK TIMES reviewer
said of “The Rope”, that it has all the
vigor of Mr. O’Neill’s sketches but it
lacks the singleness and bigness of
motions which distinguishes his work
at best. “O’Neill, while still keeping
in sight of the sea departs from the
virile, if broken sea characters of
Bound East for Cardiff and In the
Zone. We have here mainly a study
of landsmen and degenerates. The
play opens with the crooning and gib-
bering of an idiot child and the pro-
gressive senile dementia of her grand-
father. The others are harsh, sordid,
and jarring, with a single thieving
sailor lad to lend the touch of salt-sea
frankness.” The critic praises Kane’s

performance as the grandfather as
the most outstanding, not only for its
richly colored artistic individuality
but extreme range in character as-
sumption. Apparently Mr. Kane was
good, but we may hope Robert Carter
will give us reason for comparison.

To get right down to April 1945. at-
tention should be called to the immi-
nent arrival of a number of worthwhile
plays.

The Theatre Guild will set forth
“Swing Out Sweet Land”, “Jacobow-
sky and the Colonel” and “Othello”,
all within two months. Its first offer-
ing, “Swing Out Sweet Land” is nota-
ble for its staging by Loen Leonidoff,
and dances by Charles Weidman and
Doris Humphrey. It will play at the
Great Northern, beginning March 31.
At the Civic Opera House, Mary Mar-
tin and John Boles will sing Perelman
and Nash lyrics to Kurt Weill’s mu-
sic, in one we’ve all been waiting to
see, “One Touch of Venus”. Agnes
De Mille did the choreography for
this musical comedy about a beautiful
statue brought to life. The Hart
Brothers, Moss and Bernard are most-
ly responsible for “Dear Ruth”, an-
other comedy, but with no music, to
play at the Harris. To quote Mr.
Gibbs from THE NEW YORKER,
“ ‘Dear Ruth’ is a variation of a good
many other pieces about the girl and
the soldier on a brief leave, but it’s an
intelligent one . . . really quite pleas-
ant.”

The evening was off to a rousing
start with a fervent Ellingtonian ren-
dition of the Star Spangled Banner;
not once, from the first moment, were
we allowed to lost the distinct impact
of the Genius. Nevertheless, the first
half of the program was splotchy and
rather heavy laden, progressing from
an elaborate, Rhapsody in Blue-ish
Blutopia, through a riffy Midriff, the
always lovely Creole Love Call, Duke’s
latest ballads, and finally culminating
in the excerpts from Black, Brown,
and Beige. Upon this second hearing
of three movements from Duke’s much
publicized, little heard tone parallel,
I sensed the Chicago audience was
yet puzzled, as was I. Perhaps in its
entirety BB & B offers a different
story, but its excerpts, excepting spo-
ratic moments, convey little meaning.

The second half of the program
found the audience more relieved, the
band more relaxed, and the music
more regularly exciting. The hall
rocked to It Don't Mean A Thing If
You Ain't Got That Swing featuring
a magnificent tenor ride from Al Sears,
swooned to Johnny’Hodges on Mood
to Be Wooed, moved with Al Kibbler’s
effective vocal of Strange Feeling and
Duke’s whimsical piano on Dancers in
Love.

Responding to overwhelming audi-
ence insistence, Duke played a half
an hour over the regular schedule
with jamming on Frankie and Johnnie
and Honeysuckle Rose. It took no
Down Beat to prove Duke is still King.

Judy Downs

Servin' It Hot

Upon taking account of any
evening of music by Duke Elling-
ton, conscientiously offered, the
conclusion is almost inevitable
that this is yet the greatest band
of them all. The Duke’s second
concert at the Civic Opera House
last Sunday, under sponsorship of
Down Beat Magazine was no ex-
ception.

Nothing in Particular

Erle Thiemer has been promoted to second lieutenant on the West Front
and was decorated for bravery. Patty Meyers is back on campus with a new
Eso pledge pin and it’s said that she’s engaged. While we were browsing
around in the College Library we found a book titled, “Stories for Men”—
we picked it up and signed our name to the charge-out card and found that
of 15 people who’d taken it out, 100 per cent were female. (It reminds one
of a famous story about a widespread advertising campaign for a book which
told girls what they should know before marriage—thousands of curious
women sent in for the book and promptly sent it back—it was nothing more
than a cook book.)

One day last week we went past Barlett Gym late in the afternoon and
saw students straggling out at a very late hour, smiling happily to them-

we’d say that you don’t get the meat anyhow.

Saurday’s party thrown by Deke, Alpha Delt, and Psi U was quite the

and in close proximity is another sign asking us to turn off the lights when
class is done. Chapel Union’s outing will be held in May. Someone has fi-
nally told us why Rod MacLeish keeps the horsewhip in his room—he’s re-
serving it for one of his “friends” who once tried to stab him. In deference

Our Fate Has Come

Because of a very innocuous remark last week we have been doomed to

Prof. Middeldorf Gives
Art Dept. Aims,Results

(This is the second in a group of
articles designed to acquaint the read-
er with the various departments on
campus, their work and their aims.)

By Helen Tarlow

To promote a critical understanding
of art; to give an insight into its his-
tory—the Art Department, headed by
Prof. Ulrich A. Middeldorf, devotes
its efforts. Professor Middeldorf
stresses the fact that the courses
offered are not limited to artists; the
department tries to avoid dispensing
technical, vocational training.

The department itself only emerged
from the Education Department in
1930; it has since developed into a
well, equipped function of the Uni-
versity. Aids for the student take
the form of a slide department, con-
sisting of 45,000 slides, which permit
first-hand study; the photography de-
partment, 450,000 strong; an excellent
Art Library on the fourth floor of
Goodspeed; dark-room facilities that,
during the war, are being used by the
Documentary Film Group. As for
“places”, there is the seminar room
and kitchen, and the two galleries,
the “big” and the “little”, where ex-
hibits are held.

Another aid is the relation between
the Art Department and the Art In-
stitute. There is a constant exchange
of students, those seeking profession-
al training taking courses there, those
needing training in history and criti-
cism, coming here. Cooperation takes
the equally real form of sharing teach-
ers and facilities (most of our semi-
nars are held downtown, to be near
the “real thing”) and mutual effort,
with regard to exhibits and whatever
else is underway. Prof. Middeldorf
has advocated for other schools the
tying together of museum and student

Dutch City Planning
At Goodspeed Exhibit

An Exhibit of Modern Dutch Archi-
tecture and City Planning is now be-
ing shown under the sponsorship of
the Renaissance Society in Goodspeed
Hall. They start you off with a few
pictures of the traditional Dutch archi-
tecture and for no apparent reason
also show copies of a few famous
paintings that hang inside the build,
ings.

Buildings contructed after World
War I were also shown. They are
inexpensive, well ventilated, light, and
fairly attractive. By doing away
with all ornaments and accenting the
function they have acquired great
rhythm and power.

I was particularly impressed by the
way the Dutch had arranged these
buildings in some of their large scale
projects. They have planned whole
cities on their drawing boards. Some
are already made and in use. The
Community at The Hook is an exam-
ple of one. Since the people of the
Netherlands started living in such
buildings their health rate has gone
UP remarkably.

Mary Ann Thomas

groups as an intelligent solution for
both.

Cooperation is not limited to the
Art Institute, however; art groups
and artists circulate freely at Good-
speed—proving that we have a milieu
in our midst!

Exhibits are handled for the most
part by the Renaissance Society, a
group independent of the Art Depart-
ment. It was established before the
department existed by interested
members of the faculty and the com-
munity, to quote the constitution, “to
provide at the University such mate-
rial means and personal influence as
will contribute to the interest of the
students and the members of the
University community in the cultiva-
tion of the arts.” Outstanding ex-
hibits in the past have been the exhi-
bition of John Sloan paintings, a more
recent one of Chinese paintings, and a
still more recent one of Feininger
paintings. John Sloan’s etchings have
just given way to an exhibition of
Modern Dutch Architecture and City
Planning which continues through
March 31. These exhibits perform a
service to the community and the Uni-
versity, constituting a valuable con-
tact with the “world outside”.

The Student Art Club is more of a
campus organization, and again it is
to be stressed that participation is
not limited to artists. The club, whose
president is Vivian Scheidemantal,
puts on exhibits of student art, ar-
ranges for lectures, and other “artis-
tic” activities, but its major activity,
is the tea held every Friday after-
noon, to which all are invited, and at
which art and all other subjects are
aired.

Drop around sometime—the Art
Department would love to have you!

ON THE FENCE

-- THE CHICAGO MAROON ----

Critic Finds Composer's
Concert Lacking

From the point of view of last min-
ute changes, last Friday’s Composer’s
concert was the most hectic of the
season. The Malipiero and Bartok
quartets were omitted because of the
sudden illness of Rudolf Kolisch, first
violinist of the Pro Arte Quartet. But
no explanation was given in the pro-
gram notes for the omission of the
originally featured premiere of Tans-
man’s Divertimento. I learned from
Cecil Smith, Chairman of the Music
Department, that the program was
found to be too long, and thus it was
decided to omit the Tansman work.
Mr. Smith acknowledged the error of
those concerned in not notifying the
Maroon in time for publication.

First number on the program, as it
was finally given was the Milhaud
“Sonata on Anonymous Themes of
the 18th Century”, for viola and pi-
ano, played by Germaine Prevost,
violist; and Gunnar Johansen, piano.
The music is very pleasing, having
close affinities to that composer’s
Suite Provencale for orchestra; but
the performance was too much of the
18th century to do the work justice,
that is, the work was played with a
delicacy which was inappropriate to
the style.

Mr. Prevost returned to play Stra-
vinsky’s Elegie for viola alone. The
work is written for muted viola
throughout and requires very careful
tone control for the successful enun-
ciation of its fugue-like double-stop
passages. Here Mr. Prevost’s inter-
pretation was very sensitive, worthy
of the dedication Stravinsky gave
him. Of a completely contrasting
character was the Sonata for unac-
companied violoncello by Zoltan Ko-
daly. This is a show piece for the
cello. Every conceivable technical
trick is employed; double-stop trills,
brilliant broken chords, guitar-like
pizzicatti, pizzicato counter themes
and punctuation beneath the melody,
wierd sur ponticello phrases, etc. For
a last minute substitute, Mr. Ernst

Friedlander gave a truly remarkable
performance. The excruciatingly dif-
ficult technical feats were tossed off
neatly and with a great deal of spir-
it. The music was very melodious,
and, especially in the last movement,
infected with the gayety and verve of
a Spanish dance.

The Hindemith “Sonata for Trum-
pet and Piano,” which brought the
concert to a close, was, unhappily, the
least successful. The music itself is
not Hindemith’s best; at times it was
strongly reminiscent of Matthias the
Painter, but those were the better
times. However, the chief objection
lies in the performance. Gerald Huff-
man, the trumpeter, played with an
inelastic tone, and little variation of
dynamics; whether this was due to an
inability to grasp the music, or be-
cause of the technical difficulties, I
cannot tell, but the result was not a
happy one. Dorothy Walters’ accom-
paniment was good, but suffered from
Mr. Huffman’s excessive drive.

Book

Stuff

Age of Thunder can best be de-
scribed as “exciting.” Not in the
sense of an adventure story—the ac-
tion in the book is secondary—but
ratUer in an emotional sense. It’s a
little questionable whether the author
ever did have a fully developed plot in
mind, but we don’t think the reader
will be much disturbed by ‘that.

It is first, the characters, and sec-
ond, the dreamy out-of-this world-yet-
very-much-in-it quality that provides
the excitement and quickening of feel-
ing that gives the reader a sense of
having had a deep emotional experi-
ence.

We think you’ll be willing to forego
the plot and action for the privilege
of meeting the exotic characters and
digesting their views on life, love and
war.	M.A.A.
