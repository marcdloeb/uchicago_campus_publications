Yarnelle Warns Burton-Judson
In Circular Against Vandalism

Warning that a crackdown will follow persistent destruction
of property, appropriation of food and equipment, and random
disposal of refuse on the grounds surrounding the entries, John
E. Yarnelle, Acting Director of Residence Halls, this week called on
Burton-Judson residents to cooperate with authorities and “apply
the principles of individual integrity and generous thought for
the comforts of others.”

Yarnelle, in a circular sent to
all residents of the courts, said
that administrative authorities
in deference to opinion have es-
tablished no rules to govern con-
duct within the halls. But he said
that the outbreak of vandalism
and “practices rightly condemned
in all decent civilized communities
have been indulged in to the
point where it becomes necessary
to study the situation more seri-
ously and to devise intelligent
means for coping with the prob-
lem.”

Yarnelle warns that it might be-
come necessary to levy additional
“charges on individuals or groups of
individuals or to impose restrictions
on the accessibility and perhaps re-
duce the volume of food and equipmerit
now offered.”

“This letter,” Yarnelle concluded,
“constitutes an exordium to all resi-
dents to solve the problems alluded
to through the application of the
principle* of individual integrity and a
generous thought for the comforts of
others.”

* * *

Irene Eilers, chosen “The Girl You’d
Like to Remember”, climaxed the
Beecher formal last Friday night as
she stepped out from between the
pages of a large memory book. Irene
was awarded the title by the votes of
the boys present.

Another highlight of the evening
was a floorshow including a variety
act by Barbara • Vandevanter, and
songs by a trio composed of Joy
Matthews, Sylvia Slade and Carol
Grey. Mr. ^nd Mrs. Zens L. Smith
chaperoned the affair and Dean Smith
obliged the group with a few numbers
on his guitar.

Distribution of four cigarettes to
each male present added to the success
of the evening.

Last Wednesday evening the Foster
girls had as their dinner guest Miss
Selma Jean Cohen of the English De-

partment. In an informal discussion

after dinner Miss Cohen talked about
poetry.

The Gates-Blake dance was held

Last Saturday in Ida Noyes Gym,

of the Stevens Hotel under the aus-
pices of American Youth for Democ-

The rally will emphasize the neces-
sity for unity and cooperation to pro-
mote the American spirit of freedom
and equality among all groups. It is
being held to expose the organized
forces working to create disunity
through fostering intolerance, preju-
dice, discrimination, and any anti-

Commuters To
Attend Kelly,
Foster Party

In recognition of the need for closer
correlation between the dormitory and
commuter girls the residents of Fos-
ter and Kelly halls will give a coke
party for the commuter girls of the
first and second years of the College.
They hope that this party, to be held
in both halls next Thursday from'4
till 5:30 p.m., will help the girls to
know and appreciate one another bet-
ter.

Entertainment is being planned by
the Social Committees of both dorms,
headed by Jean Cranston, Kelly, and
Anna Nichols, Foster. All girls of the
first and second years of the College
will receive invitations by mail. The
committees announced that in order
to make this party a real success the
girls must come out en masse.

‘Driftwood’

Presenting the second and last play
of the quarter, the Office of Dramatic
Productions announces its choice as
“Driftwood” by Maurice Tei Dunn.

“Driftwood”, never before produced,
concerns a young woman’s escape from
reality. “The setting,” says Jere Mic-
kel, the director, “is stark and primi-

U. C. Business
School Head
Is Promoted

William H. Spencer, regional direc-
tor of the War Manpower Commission
since October 21, 1942, has resigned
after twenty-one years as Dean of the
School of Business of the University
of Chicago to accept appointment to
the newly established Hobart W.
Williams Distinguished Service Pro-
fessorship, President Robert M.
Hutchins announced this week.

Spencer will teach in the Business
and Law Schools and in the Division
of Social Sciences, specializing in
problems involving the relations be-
tween government and industry. He
will remain officially on leave to the
WMC, however, and during the war
emergency will continue to teach only
in the evening courses of the Execu-
tives Program of the School of Busi-
ness.

“The appointment of Mr. Spencer is
important as marking the University
of Chicago’s desire to explore a prob-
lem of the greatest importance to the
nation, the relations between govern-
ment and industry,” President Hutch-
ins said in announcing the appoint-
ment. “Mr. Spencer obviously is highly
qualified because of his distinction as
a scholar, the various important offi-
ces he has held, and his present mem-
bership in the War Manpower Com-
missions and the National Railroad
Labor Panel.”

Hutchins Guest
Of Delta Sigma

President Hutchins was guest of
honor at the Delta Sigma Tea, Satur-
day, February 17, celebrating the
club’s thirtieth anniversary. Alumnae
president Elinor Englemann present-
ed Mr. Hutchins with a check for
$200 for the Delta Sigma scholarship
fund. He expressed his appreciation
to the active chapter and alumnae for
their efforts and explained the im-
portance of group sponsored scholar-
ships.

Albert F. Cotton, Bursar, and Charl-
ton Beck, Secretary of the Alumni
Association, were also guests.

Where Are The Debaters?

For several weeks, Dale Stucky, Director of the Student
Forum, has been making strenuous efforts to encourage students
to try out for positions on the team which is to represent the
University at the annual Big Ten Debate Conference at North-
western on March 8 and 9. The net result to date has been the
appearance of eight students to compete for positions on a four-man
team. Obviously, any team selected on such a basis will fare
poorly against other Big Ten representatives.

An ever-present tradition on campus has been the familiar
complaints of students that the University has always lacked
talent to compete with other schools successfully. Usually, it is
added that this condition is due primarily to the discouraging
influence of the Administration, especially in its refusal to pros-
elyte. Yet, in this instance, if the University debate team fails to
retain its championship status won at last year’s conference, the
fault must lie with the students alone.

It is ridiculous to claim that there are no more than eight
among 4600 students who are sufficiently interested in forensic
competition to try for the University team. It is, rather, a shock-
ing lack of “school spirit”, basic loyalty to the University that
keeps students from supporting with their time and talent the
competitive activities which are so important in maintaining our
off-campus reputation. Especial attention should be given to those
other campus groups who profess keen interest in topics of
current social significance. Where are the members of our polit-
ical clubs?

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Here and There

The Day Is Near

The fifteen student organizations which are jointly sponsoring
tonight’s all-campus carnival are to be congratulated heartily.
It is most satisfactory to note that the World Student Service
Fund drive is receiving the support that it so richly deserves.
Few better student causes or activities exist. Furthermore, the
mere fact that fifteen campus groups were able to combine their
energies in this direction is encouraging to those of us who have
an abiding faith in the efficacy of group action for a common good.

We cannot help but wonder, however, how much more success-
ful such a carnival could be if some form of student government
were already in existence on campus, and could, therefore, take
official cognizance of and action on such a venture. This is definitely
a proper province for student council consideration.

With so many areas of valuable activity open to a student
council, we believe that it is mandatory for the entire student body
to bend their every effort towards the prompt realization of this
goal which can serve our mutual good so well.

An ever-increasing interest in student government on the
part of many students on campus can only serve to spur on the
thoughtful deliberations of the dorm-commuter committee in the
formation of constitution for our government. The day when a
council plan will be presented to and accepted by the 4600 students
at the University must not be far off.

Documentary Group Shows Program
Of Films on Domestic Problems

“The City”, “Valley Town”, and “The Case of Charlie Gordon”, three
films presented by the Documentary Film Group on Tuesday, February 20,
comprised a well rounded program on domestic problems.

“The City”, in spite of its frequent showings, continues to be timely and
informative. It deals with the problems of housing, contrasting industrial
city slums with modern housing projects. A good part of the attraction of
“The City” lies in its excell ant filming and sound background.

“Valley Town” showed the worker’s side of the problem of machine
replacing man-power. Although the unemployment brought on by this
transition is not evident at the present time, the problem is a recurring one.

“The Case of Charlie Gordon” pictured Canada’s solution of the problem
of unskilled, unemployed youth. It presented the entire apprenticeship
system, followed by supporting statistics. This is also an obsolete problem
at the present time, but one that will recur. —B.Y.

At Washington
Buys Ski Lodge

The Student Council at the
University of Washington has
just completed the purchase of
a ski lodge accomodating 26 per-
sons, for use of students at the
University. At the same time,
arrangements were made to lease
135 acres of land surrounding the
lodge, for a two-year period.
Both lodge and land are at pres-
ent the property of the Northern
Pacific Railway Company. Fac-
ilities of the lodge include two
living rooms, two sets of sleep-
ing porches, two kitchens, and
two large fireplaces.

excessive rents. The group is
backing a four-point program to

an immediate University investi-

remedy present sub-standard con-

Critic Praises 'Total Effect’
Of World Playhouse Feature

TWO SOLDIERS, the film current
at the World Playhouse presents re-
markable evidence that, artistically,
the whole can be more than the sum
of its parts.

The plot is remarkably trite: two
buddies in the siege of Leningrad, sep-
arated by a girl, make secret sacrifices
for each other, and are finally united
with all misunderstandings cleared
away. The continuity is maintained
sketchily if at all, and the English ti-
tles do not greatly contribute to one’s
appreciation. It is rather discon-
certing to listen to a long and vehe-
ment speech evidently containing sev-
eral shades of meaning and find the
English title Hashing on to say curtly

In the Interests of Science

Canadian Students Make Study
Of Lipstick Distribution

(Ed. Note: Believing that it will be of great interest to the campus at large
and especially to those gaining an understanding of the scientific method via
Bi Sci, Phy Sci, or Oil, we reprint the following report on this research of
great importance, which originally appeared in the Journal of Queen’s
University, Kingston, Ontario.)

When two surfaces, one of which is
coated with a layer of lipstick, meet,
a certain distribution of the lipstick
takes place. The second surface,
which was originally clean, retains a
portion of the material. This paper

is a
this
tion

study of the variables affecting
distribution and the determina-
of the coefficient of distribution.

NOMENCLATURE

P—pressure, N—number of applica-
tions, T—temperature of experiment,
A'—area of the transmitter, A"—area
of the receiver, i—intensity of light,
K—Newton’s constant, P—pucker fac-
tor, II—passion.

NOTES ON THE VARIABLES

The most important variable under
consideration is that of pressure.
Harris reports that in 193 tests, using
variations of pressure, the amount of
material transferred was a direct func-
tion of the pressure. This report tends
to bear out the experiments of Nicht-
lieber, who used several transmitters
under the same laboratory conditions,
i.e., on the same night. Nichtlieber
conducted his tests in the Theta Phi
Alpha laboratory in 1943. When the
pressure is zero, the distribution is
also zero; as pressure increases, the
flow of lipstick increases rapidly up
to a certain maximum. Under ex-
tremely high pressures, the equilibri-
um conditions are reached almost im-
mediately. Equilibrium occurs when
the amount of lipstick on one surface
is equal to that on the other.

It has been found that if pressure
is plotted against distribution, the
curve assumes the shape of a “puck-
ered pair” of lips. (This is standard
nomenclature for the phenomenon. To
say a “pair of puckered lips” infers
that one lip can be puckered independ-
ently—an impossibility.) The exact
shape of the curve is determined by
“p”, the pucker factor.

B, the variable measuring the sur-
face conditions, is an exponential func-
tion of the pucker factor and pressure.
Under normal operating conditions,
the surface of the contacting areas
is fairly smooth. However, if the sur-
faces are contracted and drawn up
into folds and wrinkles, i.e., puckered,
then surface conditions are far from
being ideal for complete distribution.
As pressure increases, the surface be-
comes more ideal, i.e., smooth.

(For Installment II of this paper,
dealing with the other variables, equa-
tions, and experimental conditions,
see next week’s Chicago Maroon.)

“We know you guys from Odessa.”
In spite of these handicaps, the film
as a whole is extremely satisfying. As
is to be expected, the photography
was quite wonderful, and the folk
songs sung by one of the soldiers were
sincere and beautiful. The acting was
magnificent in its simplicity and dig-
nity. A complete absence of artificial-
ity characterized every performance
and in spite of the naivete of plot one
is left feeling that this is £ true repre-
sentation of life. There is an absence
of all ranting against the Germans
and all hysteria, leaving only a monu-
mental idealism and faith in the dig-
nity and eventual salvation of hu-
manity.

Letters to Editor

Cohen Defends
ODP Against
Maroon Critic
To the Editor:

It seems to be a naive conception
of aspiring journalists to make things
either simulatedly intellectual on one
hand or as vitriolic as possible on the
other. The criticism which our in-
trepid reviewer, Betty Steams, made
of the “Inspector General” shows a
mixture of wisdom, ignorance, and
sublime indifference to the problems
which ODP faces.

There is no doubt that the criticism
of the play was lodged in its inability
to make its satiric elements appear
motivated. This was no doubt due to
bad script editing, lack of stage busi-
ness, and un-unified climaxes, but was
it therefore a bad play? Mustn’t there
have been fine points which Miss
Stearns’ zealous haste overlooked?
The acting and character portayals
were certainly complete, and as a re-
sult there is no excuse for such a
Nietzchean review. Being a writer, (I
use this word loosely), she must be
acquainted with the critical criteria
which a reviewer must employ, name-
ly, that of mentioning the good and
the bad in a one-to-one correspond-
ence. Where the good outweighs the
bad, one might reasonably say the
play was good. In any other event we
might say it was a Stearns’ review.

As to more essential matters. The
Dean’s Office is so suffocated with the
idea of letting everything die unless
it perceptibly aids the understanding
of the great books, that it offers no
backing, encouragement, or even a nod
to ODP. One cannot be interested in
the artistic refinements Miss Stearns’
whimsies about when ODP is worry-
ing where its next set is coming from.
To an untrained audience which is not
appreciative of delicate performances,
but would rather swallow smut at ev-
ery show, ODP must cater. We need
their 60 cents and we’ll do anything
to get it. Now if the Dean’s Office
could back ODP we could well say the
“devil take” the audience and the stu-
dents would see some subtle, under-
played performances for a change.

“Don’t blame the mirror if it’s your
own mug that’s crooked.” Remember
Miss Stearns and the Dean’s Office.

EDWARDS DIRECTS RADIO STUDY

Twenty-Five Utilize Miniature

Broadcasting Studio In Swift

(Editor 8 note: This is the first of a series of two articles on Davis
Edwards and his Radio Shop by Chicago Maroon feature writer, Mary Beth
Nelson.)

Up and coming radio addicts could very well afford to take
advantage of a miniature, but very complete radio station located
in the offices of Davis Edwards in Swift 404. Here they may find
all of the paraphernalia of a regular broadcasting studio where a
group of students, under Mr. Edwards’ guidance, work on the
various aspects and problems of radio broadcasting.

Twenty-five students are en-
rolled in this course, the enroll-
ment of which is limited So as to
insure individual attention. The
radio work itself, consists of a se-
quence of classes, radio speech
including microphone technique,
problems of musical background
and sound effects,- actual rehear-
sals, radio dramatics, and more
advanced study in radio work.

The actual problems of broadcast-
ing are, however, not the only feature
connected with the radio course.
Classes in speech training, voice and
phonetics, oral interpretation of lit-
erature, and a theoretical course in
classics and speech criticism are offer-
ed to the student as a preparation for

Servin' It Hot

Good news for Chicago jazz fans!
Coming up hot are a series of the
most promising jam sessions that the
Windy City has offered for a long,
long time. The man responsible is
Phil Featheringill, who is rapidly ce-
menting his position as keystone of
local jazz activities. In happy contrast
to the distatefully and incongruously
staged jam sessions this city has seen
too often, Phil’s plans show the prom-
ise of well organized jazz presenta-
tions.

Next Sunday afternoon at 2:00, on
the bandstand of the Club Zanzibar
(1036 N. State) we will have a star
studded line up of New Orleans musi-
cians: Punch Miller, trumpet; Preston
Jackson, trombone; Darnell Howard,
clarinet; Baby Dodds, drums; John
Lindsay, bass; Richard M. Jones,
piano.

The line up for the following Sun-
day, March 4, is an impressive and
carefully chosen nucleus of the expo-
nents of the “Chicago style”: Bud
Jacobson, tenor; Volley De Faut, clar-
inet; Bill Stapleton, trumpet; Bud
Wilson, trombone; Tut Soper, piano;
Pat Patterson, bass; Lou Finnerty,
drums.

These sessions, it seems, could
hardly miss.

* * *

Jazz on Campus . . .

On a short cut through the lobby of
Ida, on my unhappy way to a Phy Sci
lecture Saturday morning, I thought
I heard chance strains of the Blues in
B Flat emitting from the gym. Here,
buried under a batch of red streamers
and paper cupids with which a frantic
Freshman social committee was
strewing the gym, were uncovered two
campus cats doing a charming little
bit of improvising. Playing tenor was
Mark Levant, and his colleague on
piano, Dick Collins, both apparently
of the first year of the College. Addi-
tion of drums and another horn would
result in a nice little jam combination.
Where are the other musicians on
the Quadrangles?

Newest angle on our Hot Club: for-
mation of a Society for the Apprecia-
tion of American Folk Music. Well,
that’s what someone said to me . . .

the actual laboratory work. In all
cases Mr. Edwards has as his aim the
training of students in thought, lan-
guage, voice, and action; all that en-
compasses the whole problem of com-
munication. As Mr. Edwards says:
“In radio work, the most important
part consists of communication, espe-
cially that of the spoken word, and it
is one of the aspects that I strive to
accentuate in all of my courses.”

Every course receives full aca-
demic credit and although most
of the students are from the divi-
sions, members of the college are
admitted. Mr. Edwards stated
that he found that most of the
students enroll for the radio and
speech courses as training for ac-
tual professional radio work, oth-
ers to see if they are at all fitted
. for the broadcasting profession.

As interesting as the colorful Lili-
putian broadcasting station is Davis
Edwards, who has been teaching at
the University for nearly fifteen
years. Hetdid his graduate work here,
as well as at the University of Wis-
consin where he also served on the
faculty. Other positions he held were
at the University of Minnesota, and
New York University.

Mr. Edwards is noted all over the
country for his interperative readings,
and has given a series of 50 plays un-
der the auspices of the University
College. For the last four years he
has given readings on campus during
the summer, a practice which he plans
to continue this summer. His last
summer’s program included such not-
able works as “Cyrano de Bergerac”,
“Marco Millions” and “The Patriots”.
Next quarter Mr. Edwards will not be
instructing here as he has been as-
signed to writing and research. He
will return, however, at the beginning
of the summer quarter.

Gorki Film to Be
Seen Next Tuesdav
W

“Lower Depths”, by Maxim Gorki,
will be the fourth fiction film present-
ed by the Documentary Film Group
this quarter. It will be shown in So-
cial Science 122 at 8:00 p.m. Tuesday.
Though the film itself is of French
origin, the scene is laid in a boarding-
house in Old Russia.

The plot involves portrayal of vari-
ous forms of human degeneracy—cyn-
icism, alcoholism, theft, introversion
—with Jean Gabin, in his uninhibited
manner, playing the part of the thief.
One central theme, the desire of hu-
man beings for betterment of their

Bach to Bax

During most of this academic year
the only extra-curricular musical ac-
tivities available to students have been
the choir, the orchestra, and a few
music groups of rather sporadic fre-
quency and variable value. Now, at
last, there would seem to be looming
on the far horizon a rosy dawn in the
form of a student chamber orchestra
which proposes to be entirely student-
managed and student-controlled. The
group would like to play, for their
own amusement largely, some of the
works for small orchestra. Interested
parties should contact Samuel Golden,
care of The Chicago Maroon, Faculty
Exchange, or Extension 351.

The January-February number of
Modem Music has two articles by
Cecil Smith, Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Music. One, entitled “Big
Names in Chicago”, is devoted to a
consideration of the moderns played
in Chicago during the fall. The other,
“Music and the Humanities”, contains
the prescient remark, “Only the gifted
ought to be encouraged to try to com-
pose ...” So true; but who is going
to recognize the gifted? I seem to
remember a Viennese critic named
Hanslick who guessed wrong about
Wagner as a composer and von Bulow
as a conductor.

* * •*

Modem Music would be a good
magazine if its writers stopped trying
to make it the New Yorker of the
musical world. Such remarks as,
“Bloch’s . . . Suite for Viola and
Orchestra . . . had no harmful effects
upon the audience saving a slight

mal-de-mer.

Around

The Town

Otto was feeling cooperative last
week, so instead of hunting another
chow line for you, he battled the el-
ements with us and collected donations
for W.S.S.F.

With his usual lust for discovery,
Otto became an omniscient observer.
While omnisciently observing, he
started to analyze neglectful charac-
ters who dared to say “No,” when
we stuck collection boxes in their un-
suspecting faces. Among these un-
humanitarian souls he was able to
sight three specific types.

First is the Dominant Donator.
This lug ignores the guy wire rigged
for tripping prospects while climbing
over collectors, explaining in a boom-
ing basso that he has already given
life blood at “ten other places,” natur-
ally leaving the box empty.

Then there’s the Magnificient Mar-
tyr. He listens to our plea with pained
looks, submitting a life history of
donating to worthy causes, denying
himself lunches and leaving nothing
for W.S.S.F.

Final Pet Peeve is the Quiet Ques-
tioner. This fiend stands for 20 min-
utes asking about W.S.S.F.’s activities,
reading phamphlets and generally giv-
ing us the third degree, only to turn
on his heels with, “I don’t believe
in it!”

Luckily for the W.S.S.F. there
weren’t many of the above, but we
still remember one heckler who stood
on the sidelines shouting, “Give to
the W.S.S.F.—we give kerosene to
poor Chinese students who can’t afford
good Scotch.”

One of our more reliable spies reported that last week he
saw Mr. Hutchins out strolling with Maude and an Irish setter
on leash (he neglected to mention which was on leash). The
Great Man also put in an appearance at the Delta Sigma Scholar-
ship Tea Saturday. From our vantage point in the Maroon office

we note that the Hutchins
haven’t been taken down yet.

Revival of an Institution

The Chapel Union carnival

in the shekels from booths (all kinds of games are promised) and a continu-
ous play. One of the lesser virtues of the continuous play is that if the
tomato misses the first time, you always have another chance. The long-
lost institution of electing a Mr. Glamor-Pants is making a comeback. Inter-
Club is sponsoring a booth in which will be arrayed candidates chosen by
each club for the title. One penny means one vote for any of the following-
Sigma’s Marty Hansen, Tau Sig’s Ray Feldman, Pi Delt’s Dick Harrison,
Wyvern’s Jack McCarthy, or Chi Rho’s Larry Kielman (he’s supposed to be
the motherly type). There’ll be more and rumor says that Walter from Ida
will be the Quad’s dark horse entry.

* * *

Odds and Ends

Lt. David Livingston and wife (she’s the former Fanny Cuttie) announce
the birth of a boy; they’re down in Durham, N.C., now. Irene Eilers was the
Girl You’d Like to Remember at the Beecher Hall formal—she and the dance
scored quite a hit. Sarah Goodell has just been named .an honorary member
of Animalville (no, we’ve never heard of it either—someone says it’s 36 miles
from Indiana). Some jealous female from Gates Hall put up a large red
light in Blake; one fellow coming over for his date was scared away. Gloria
Sandalis is wearing John Denko’s pin (we saw it first at the Psi U party
Saturday night).

*	♦	*

Tragedy of the Year

We regret to announce the passing of one of the more beloved characters
of the University campus. Tuesday night witnessed a long torchlight parade
across the Quadrangles to a spot in front of Kent. Pall bearers (in hoods)
carried a bier tastefully decorated with lace and flowers; as it was lowered
tenderly into the ground, taps were played. A small monument was erected
and an epitaph read (the unabridged text may be obtained from Bob Jones);
a five firecracker salute was fired. And so ends the life history of one Archie,
the amiable pet rat of Burton-Judson.

*	*	* -

Crime on Campus *

The other day when we were walking past Rockefeller we saw a large
oil rag burning furiously in the bushes beside the Chapel, with a girl stamp-
ing frantically upon the flames. Arson? All evil-doers come to some bad end;
or so all detective stories say, and the end has finally come to those energetic
young females who “study” so diligently in the Rosenwald john. From time
to time, there have been skirmishes between them and irate denizens on the
building; the pay-off came this week when all furniture save the necessary
was removed along with the light bulbs.

*	*	*

Information Please

Who posted the cartoon obviously pertaining to President Hutchins over
in Cobb Hall? An epidemic has hit Kelly Hall completely mystifying the
amteur medics there; they have finally diagnossed the malady as Pink Pox
(it may be scarlet fever, chicken pox, or measles). Patrons of the Reynolds
Club barbershop are wondering what has happened to the traditional policy
of selling a pack of cigarettes with a haircut.

*

This and That

Joe Schwab’s appearance at the Student-Faculty tea last Friday seem-
ingly needed no other advertising except the announcement that he would
be there. Mobs of students hung over tables and chairs to hear him expound
on any and all subjects. Speaking of teas, all this week the Orientation Board

Book Stuff

THE THURBER CARNIVAL has
arrived with a colorful red and cream
cover and much fanfare.

It consists of Mr. Thurber’s own
selection of the best of his drawings
and stories; and, if you look hard
enough you may find some method in
this apparent continuation of his
many madnesses. Thurber and Co.
delight in people who don’t add up—
this of course takes most of us in, so
be prepared to read about yourself,

and like it.

It’s unfortunate that John Gunther’s
newest novel doesn’t quite come up to
the high standard set by his “Inside”

Christmas decorations apparently

at Ida Noyes tonight hopes to gather

*

books. The Troubled Midnight is a
spjA story with all the standard equip-
ment—an exotic setting, the beautiful
American heroine, the fanatic Nazi
villain, the Foreign Office career man,
the gay-lady-with-the-heart-of-gold,
and minor characters who are playing
both ends against the middle. The
characterization is not too well done,
and the plot is a little thin. This is
a trifle disappointing, because we
know Mr. Gunther can do better.

Local Nationalists Are

Fascist, Charges Union

“Are Chicago’s 'Nationalists’ Fascists ?” is the topic of Chapel
Union’s open meeting Sunday night, 7:45 at 5802 Woodlawn.

Courtenay Barber, Jr., prominent Chicago insurance executive
and leader of the Union for Democratic Action, will be the main
speaker. Samples of anti-semitic, anti-Negro, anti-ally and gen-
erally disruptive “Nationalist” propaganda, collected by Chapel
Union in its investigation of the “Nationalists” will be on display
in a comprehensive exhibit.

“Students will be amazed at the amout and violence of this
fascistic propaganda”, stated Hank Goodman, chairman of C. U.’s
investigating group. “This investigation,” he added, “has not
been 'under cover’ work; for the groups, all 200% 'American’,
operate quite openly.” A list of their offices and leaders is included

in the display.

The meeting, climax to Chapel Union’s three months’ in-
vestigation, is open to all students of the University. Those who
are unable to attend Sunday evening may see the exhibit of
propaganda at the Chapel House, 5810 Woodlawn, any afternoon
next week. The books and pamphlets can be removed from the
exhibit boards for closer study.

THE CHICAGO MAROON -----------

Carnival...

(Continued from page one)
test is said to be one of the most in-
teresting features of the Carnival.
Each of the Women’s clubs has chosen
its “Glamour Man”, and votes will be
sold to determine the winner. The
Glamour Boys will parade periodically
across the stage in the Ida Noyes The-
ater giving voters a chance to select
the most glamorous. Leading conten-
der to date is Walter, Ida Noyes’ chief
custodian, sponsored by Quadrang-
lers. With Ollie Colbertson, Ray
Feldman, Pete West, Dick Harrison,
Marty Hansen, Larry Keilman, Marsh
Barnard, Jack McCarthy and several
others as yet unannounced super-
glamour men contesting, it promises
to be a close race.

The Chapel Union drama, to be pre-
sented almost continuously, purports
to tell the truth about the Greeks.
They were, it seem®, not such great
scholars and philosophers after all.
For instance, according to the drama,
Homer got his name because his bat-
ting average was over 400.

Exigencies of the war have cancelled
plans for carnivals until this year.
The last carnival, held in the Field
House in 1941, was thought to have
been notably successful. Chapel Union,
initiating agency of this year’s Cami.
val, tonight expects a success com-
parable to those before the war. The
large number of organizations coop-
erating, the fun offered, and the fact
that profits go to WSSF are expected
to draw a record crowd of students.
The Carnival will be in continuous op-
eration from 8 p.m. until 11:45 p.m.,

Noted Negro Will
Speak Wednesday
For Campus Groups

Addressing the Negro Student Club
Wednesday evening in Ida Noyes Hall,

tributions of the Negro in American
History: Past, Present and Future”.
Patterson is a teacher of political sci-
ence and race relations at the Abra-

the main speaker at the Paris Con-
ference on Races and Anti-Semitism.

NORTH CENTRAL MEETS CHICAGO

Wow!

Chicago Sports Sparking Record

In 45 Years of Big 10 Basketball

The University of Chicago basketball team has a percentage
of .386 in forty years of Big Ten competition. This information
was announced in a recent release from the Big Ten Service
Bureau, headed by K. L. ‘Tug’ Wilson of Big Ten fame. The
release reviews the record of every Western Conference team
since the conference came into being in 1900. '

Jack Hill

Time In

We made what was probably
our last visit to the Stadium for
quite a while last Saturday eve.
Saw Great Lakes knock the
day-lights out of DePaul in one
of the major upsets of the year
and before that Michigan and
Northwestern put on a good show
too. The Wildcats came out on
the bottom of that one by a
single mark.

Sharpshooters Ajax, Cloyd, Mc-
Guire and company put on a terrific
exhibition for the dozen odd thousand
watching what was rated the ‘natur-
al of the year’. You’ve probably all
heard about Ajax and Cloyd but just
in case you haven’t, they swished in
10 of those goals that count. That’s
10 apiece . . .

Despite a slightly unrecognizable
picture of Coach Kyle Anderson in
the TIMES, baseball at Chicago con-
tinues apace. Leader Fred Cimmer-
blatt reports three new candidates for
the squad but says that there’s plenty
of room for more men. Fred tells us
that Jim Servies is coming along in
great style and that the pitching staff
looks better every day. Cimmerblatt
looks plenty good himself but John
Spencer still isn’t out. When and if
he makes an appearance is question
number one on the sports’ list this
week.

Foster Beats Quads
In Hard Fought Tilt

Last Monday two teams of the
women’s basketball league defaulted.
The 12th Grade won their game over
Nursing Education and the Quads beat
Chi Rho Sigma. Gates and Beecher
managed to get their teams out, how-
ever, and Gates was the winner 13-11.
Tuesday Delta Sigma also defaulted
to Esoteric and Beecher lost again to
the Studemps 32-18.

Wednesday afternoon a long awaited
game was played off: that of the
Quads vs. Foster. Foster had six
wins to its credit with no losses.
The Quads also boasted six wins but
had two defeats. The first quarter
was one of the hottest and closest races
this season has witnessed, but the
Foster girls pulled away in the second
half for a 17-9 victory. This ties
the 2 teams for first place with W.A.A.
which also has had an undefeated
team.

Next week’s schedule is as folllows:

Mon. 4:00	Sigma vs. XYZ
Mon. 4:00	Nursing Education vs. Foster
Mon. 4:45	Kelly vs. Beecher
Mon. 4:45	Blake vs. W.A.A.
Mon. 5:15	Studemps vs. Chi Rho Sigma
Tues. 4 :00	Esoteric vs. 12th Grade
Tues. 4:00	Green vs. 11th Grade
Wed. 5:00	Quadrangler vs. 12th Grade
Wed. 5:00	Beecher vs. XYZ
Wed. 7:30	Delta Sigma vs. Studemps

Thur. 4:45	Sigma vs. Green
Thur. 5:15	Esoteric vs. Chi Rho
Thur. 7:30	Delta Sigma vs. Nursing Education

The Maroons entered basketball
play officially in 1904, placing behind
Northwestern and Minnesota that year
with 2 victories and one defeat.
Northwestern played only one game
that year and was the conference
champ. Continuing play, Chicago did
nothing spectacular until 1907 when
they won the championship with a 10
and 2 record. The University then
won four championships in a row and
became the first team to go undefeated
in 1909.

For ten years, the Chicago ball
club was regarded as a threat and
in 1920 again took the cage crown
with 10 wins against 2 defeats. The
Quadrangle team won its final Big
Ten title in 1924 when Illinois and
Wisconsin went into a three way tie,
all with 8 victories and 4 defeats.

After 1924, the Maroon men went
into a slump from which they never
pulled out. Chicago was at the bottom
of the conference 12 times after 1924
and never had a better than .500
rating. At the time of their with-
drawal in 1944, the University had
won 182 games ani lost 288 con-
ference matches. They took the con-
ference title 6 times and placed last
12 times; The strongest part of their
record coming before 1924 and the
weakest after their last championship.

University Tankmen
Face Uncertain

1945 Season

There seems to be a chance that the

University may enter a team in Big
Ten swim competition with the little
material that is on hand, if the men
can find some time to get into shape.
It seems that the school does have
enough prospects to enter a big meet,
but, because of military duties and the
fact that they can only get into the
pool at certain times, are hampered
from getting the practice and coach-
ing they need. Then too, with the
rest of the league making the most of
the great variety of navy men that
they have, Chicago is at another disad-
vantage. The possibilities of the Ma-
roons entering the Big Ten Confer-
ence meet will be answered within the
next few weeks.

To Elect Captain

Coach Ned Merriam, varsity track
leader, has named March 1 as the
deadline for balloting for the 1945
indoor track captain. Merriam wish-
es to contact every member of the
team for purposes of voting.

Lutherans to Hear
Keinath of Concordia

Gamma Delta, the student Lutheran
organization, will meet at eight
o’clock tonight. The meeting place is
Chapel House, 5810 Woodlawn. Pro-
fessor Keinath of Concordia Teachers
College at River Forest will lead the
discussion on “The Decline of the
West.”

Varsity Places
Third at Iowa;
Hawkeyes Win

Coach Ned Merriam and his
Maroon track squad play host to
North Central College of Illinois
tomorrow at 2:30 at the Univer-
sity Fieldhouse. Chicago placed
third in a triangular meet at
Iowa City with Iowa State and
Northwestern taking first and
second honors in that order. On
the same day, North Central was
bowing to Wheaton college in a
dual meet at Wheaton.

Iowa Scores 48 Points

The Hawkeyes finished the meet
last Saturday with a total of 48 points
to top Northwestern’s 37 and Chica-
go’s 25. Iowa would have compiled a
more commanding lead except for a
rule that only one contestant for each
school could score points in an event.
That ruling supplied Chicago with a
large portion of its points.

The University took seconds in the
60 yard dash, the two mile event and
the 70 yard low hurdles. Chicago auto-
matically took third in all the other
events. Tourtelotte stepped in behind
Iowa’s Johnson who won the 60 yard
dash in 6.5 seconds, Friedlander trail-
ed behind Slater of the Hawkeyes in
the two mile event which was won
with a time of 10:29.7 minutes and the
final Maroon second was won by Rus-
sel in the low hurdles. He placed after
Johnson, who covered the 70 yards in
8.4 seconds. “ *

Saturday’s meet is the fourth meet
of the indoor season for the Univer-
sity of Chicago. Both the Maroons and
the trackmen from North Central
College will be looking for their first
victories. The Fieldhouse will be open
at 2:00, tomorrow afternoon and ad-
mission is free to all spectators.

University Gymnasts

Performing before a group of 100
faculty members, their wives and sev-
eral interested students, Coach Erwin
Beyer’s gymnasts went through their
various routines in Ida Noyes Club-
house last Saturday. About 30 gym-
nasts, both men and women, kept the
audience applauding for nearly an
hour as Beyer’s young troupe bal-
anced, leaped and jumped in many
spectacular acts.

Of particular interest to the faculty
members were such acts as Gordon
Sherman’s picking up a handkerchief
with his teeth while in a hand stand,
Joan Hammel’s contortions along the
50 foot mat and Carlton Bardman’s
finale leap over the crouched backs of
nine members of the troupe.

Schedule Draws To Close As

College, Billings Fives Play

With the season virtually over, a
general over-all look at the intra-
mural leagues finds Burton 600 in the
saddle of the College League, Senior
Medics I safely ahead in the Billings
League, and Burton 300 way in front
of the other Fraternity-Dormitory
men.

There was only one game played in
the College; here, the Burton 400
team, playing with only four men,
bowed out and yielded second place to
a tall team from 800. In the Fraterni-
ty-Dormitory League, Burton 300 de-
feated Phi Sigma Delta, and Psi U
won over the Golden Maroons. Burton
200 forfeited to Hill’s Entry, and the
Spastics paid their respects to Navy
Frosh in like manner. Burton 200
played their usual game by forfeiting
once more, this time to Burton 300.
Hill’s Entry won once again on a for-
feit, a gift of Sigma Chi, as Phi Gam-
ma Delta crawled away from Psi U
in a tight game, 18-15, and Phi Gam-
ma Delta squeezed past the Golden
Maroons, 15-14. Sigma Chi then for-
feited to Burton 300.

Meanwhile, Burton 200 once more

Chicago Marksmen
Lambast Michigan

Shooting in their first interscholas-
tic match with a Big Ten Rifle team,
the University of Chicago undergrad
squad defeated the University of
Michigan’s varsity sharpshooters,
3607 to 3426. The Maroons used a ten
man team with but one girl, Ann Bok-
man, entered. Merril Nelson was high
man in the meet with a score of 375
out of a possible 400. Miss Bokman
had a card of 351. John Stetson, vice-
president of the rifle and pistol club,
shot a perfect score in the prone posi-
tion making 100 out of a possible 100.

This was the undergraduates’ elev-
enth straight win in eleven matches
and marks one of the longest winning
streaks in the history of the club.

Krueger Speaks
To Socialists

Before a capacity crowd Monday
night Professor Maynard C. Krueger
led a discussion on “Socialism and
Russia”. This meeting was held under
the auspices of the Socialist Club
which has scheduled an important bus-
iness meeting for Monday at 7:30 p.m.
in Social Science 105.

Krueger, in his discussion, first set
up the criteria for a socialist society
—a society where the means of pro-
duction are democratically managed
as well as commonly owned and where
political liberty, the traditional free-
dom, and civil liberties hold full sway.
He then compared conditions in Rus-
sia with these criteria. His opinion,
and that of the majority of the audi-
ence was that Russia was collectivist,
but not Socialist.

College Swimmers
End Good Season

With the defeat of South Shore
High School, the College swimming
team drove its season to what seems
to be a most successful close.

The team lost only one meet on
its calendar of five, winning from
Proviso, Elgin, Morgan Park, and fi-
nally South Shore. The one lost was
to the Tilden boys, and it should be
added that the team’s juniors only
dropped one, and that to juniors of
powerful Oak Park, a member of the
South Suburban league.

On March 9, the team will play host
to the private schools of the city in
the annual Private School League
Swimming meet, at which at least
eight entries are expected.

College Tracksters
Beat Harrison, 47-36

A strong Harrison team put up a
beautiful fight to the finish with the
College men last Friday afternoon,
but bowed gracefully out at the end,
47. to 36.

Chicago cindermen began by taking
a third in the mile, but straightway
picked up firsts in the next four
events. The low hurdles were taken
by Jack Kendall and Captain Bob
Collins, in that order; Kendall return-
ed to win the dash, and Collins came
back to win the highs. Dave Hall set
his own pace in the four-forty, win-
ning with plenty to spare.
