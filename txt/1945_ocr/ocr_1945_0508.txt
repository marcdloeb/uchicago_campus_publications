Proclamation

The official V-E day proclamation as broadcast to the world
this morning by President Harry S. Truman follows in fuU:

“Now, therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the
United States of America, do hereby appoint Sunday, May 13,
1945, to be a day of prayer. I call upon the people of the United
States, whatever their faith, to unite in offering thanks to God
for the victory we have won and to pray that he will support
us to the end of our present struggle and to guide us in the
way of peace.

I also call upon my countrymen to dedicate this day of
prayer to tfie memory of those who have given their lives to
make possible our victory.

In witness thereof, I have hereunto given my hand and
caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

(Signed) Harry S. Truman

End of European War Will
Step Up UC Reconversion

Reconversion of the University from its present footing to
normal peacetime activities will be considerably speeded up by
the end of the European war, well-informed sources predicted

Hutchins To Speak;
Classes Suspended

In its massive gothic cathedral, the University of Chicago to-
day will solemnly observe the climax of the first half of the Sec-
ond World War.

last night.

The return to the University of fac-
ulty members now absent for Govern-
ment service and of facilities now be-
ing used by the Government, as well
as the cancellation of government con-
tracts and the departure of military
personnel from the Quadrangles, may
well be accelerated. Other factors af-
fecting the University in the period
following V-E Day may also be the
possible discharge of larger numbers
of war veterans than previously, and
a possible easing of priority restric-
tions which now prevent any new con-
struction.

The possibilities of getting new fac-
ulty members, especially in the Col-
lege, have been greatly impaired by
the war emergency. It is known that
the University is now attempting to
obtain the services of a number of new
men now in the Army. One of these,
Major Alan L. Chidsey, whose release
from military duty is predicted by

midsummer, is slated to become direc-
tor of all University housing accomo-
dations.

Reconversion expenditures were re-
sponsible to a large degree for the
necessity of raising tuition, a step
announced two months ago. At the
time, it was announced that estimates
for these expenditures included $177,-
000 in salaries to faculty members who
will be returned to the University
payroll, and $288,000 in upkeep on
University facilities now paid by the
government. Comment is unavailable
on the effect of the end of the war’s
first phase on these expenditures, but
the possibility is that the estimates
may prove too low. University au-
thorities also refused to predict
whether the progress of the war will
result in the cancellation of any of
the $10,500,000 in government con-
tracts held by the University for
next year.

Janus-like, 3000 students of the University, will pay tribute to
the European war and at the same time prepare to meet the chal-
lenges of the future and the peace.

A brief, appropriate service of an hour’s duration is scheduled
here htis morning at 10:30 at Rockefeller chapel. All classes in
the University will be suspended until noon in marking the end of
hostilities in the European theatre of operations.

Her armies in total collapse and her cities in rubble, the gov-
ernment of the Thi~d Reich yesterday sued for peace and the proc-
lamation of V-E day will be released today by supreme headquar-
ters and President Truman, according to a Washington pronounce-
ment.

The President...

Today’s all-student rites have been
charted by a student committee and
will highlight a 20-minute address by
President Hutchins, his first major
all-campus oration since his defense
of liberal education last fall. Hutch-
ins will speak on the “Significance of
the Peace to the University.” Sources
close to the president said last night
that the speech is expeced to be of
extreme significance, since Hutchins
is expected to outline, in broad terms,
peacetime policies of the University
and its potential expansion program.

In keeping with the occasion, a vet-
eran of this war, Ed Wood, will act as
Master of Ceremonies at today’s ob-
servance. Wood will read the official
victory proclamation and introduce
the president.

The University choral group, under
the direction of Gerhard Schroth, will
sing two anthems.

Dean of the Chapel Charles E. Gil-
key will deliver the closing prayer.
Most of the service will be of a non-
religious nature.

The national anthem will bring the
exercises to a close and in keeping
with military requests it will be “busi-
ness as usual” on the Quadrangles for
the rest of the day.

A 5-man student committee includ-
ing Jean Gatewood, Lois Beerger, Nat
Eek, Abe Krash, and Wood laid plans
for today’s program. They were as-
sisted by Dean of Students L. A.
Kimpton, John E. Yarnelle, director
of Men’s Housing; and Fredrich I.
Gottesman, Counsellor of Publications.

Quadrangles Take

War's End Calmly

The premature surrender announce-
ment as released Monday morning by
the Associated Press created a mild
flurry on the campus, but celebration
of V-E day was held in abeyance of
President Truman’s official declara-
tion.

University professors were in-
structed by the Office of the Dean of
Students to continue classes on sched-
ule until the President’s declaration
had been made.

These men can tell you why
the 7th WAR LOAN is the BIGGEST yet /

YOU ARE being asked to lend more money
than ever before—in the 7th War Loan.

These men can tell you why.

They can tell you of giant ships ready
to slide down the ways this year.

They can tell you of a whole new air

force in the building—huge new bombers
and fast new jet-propelled planes coming off
the lines by thousands.

They could show you why it is cheaper
and quicker to give our Pacific Forces en-
tirely new equipment sometimes—instead
of shipping tanks and guns from Europe.

They can, in short, show you 101 ways
in which your dollars are needed more than
ever to bring America’s might to its full
strength—so that we may crush our foe the
faster, make an end of killing, and bring
our men back home.

Will you tell these men "I can't

afford to buy my share"?

THE GENERALS and admirals can show
us why our money is needed—more
money than before.

But other men can show us something,
too.

They’re the men with twisted, crippled
limbs...with clever iron hooks instead of
hands. The blind men ... the men with

scarred, seamed faces. And perhaps worst
of all, the men with blasted, darkened minds.

They can show us, clearly, how small
is any sacrifice we make in lending money.

If you have an income, whether from
work, land, or capital, you have a quota in
the 7th War Loan. Find out what that quota
is—and make it!
