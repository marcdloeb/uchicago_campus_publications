Letters to Editor

'You on Campus Have
Vital Role In

Peace... ’

(Ed. note—The following letter is one of the most interesting that has
ever been sent to the Maroon. The writer, Robert Liberman, is a former
University student and, at present, is a lieutenant serving with the AAF
overseas. Because of the value of the message contained and because of its
length, we are publishing it in two installments, rather than delete any part.
We believe the letter's sincerity and thoughtfulness will be appreciated by
every student fortunate enough to be on this campus.)
To the Editor:

I left my home in Chicago for overseas duty in September
1944. Since then, I’ve been fortunate inasmuch as I’ve been near
enough to the war to feel the emotions that wars evoke in men
and far enough to maintain an observer’s perspective. It’ll be a
long time before I can return to my home, or to the U. of C., or
make eyes at the girls in Jackson Park, but when I do, it will be
with the knowledge that I’m returning to one of the few remaining
decent habitations in this world.

The war in Europe has taken beauty not only out of the cities
and houses and forests, but out of the people themselves. It is
hard for one to realize that eleven out of the last thirty-one years
have been World War years for Europe. The conditions attendant
upon these wars have evoked such miseries and unhappiness that
the Young American who comes here with notions of “the glory
that is Europe” finds himself disillusioned and sometimes bitter.
He finds that the supposed center of world culture is a mass of
ruins, that the lofty ideals set forth in the history books are
absent from the mass of cheap and dirty conditions that dominate
the population’s existence. He finds that here, as nowhere else,
evil apparently triumphs over good and that the means to success
lie not so much in honest perseverance but in slippery business
transactions. Before long, he is thoroughly confused in his own
mind. He has been.brought up to think one way and he sees the
very opposite set of values prevail.

I write this to you because I feel
that the solution of what I have men-
tioned lies mainly in your hands. You
have a means, through your paper,
of bringing ideas to young people;
and inferior as reading may be to
actual living and experience, it can
do a lot toward helping that young
American when he comes back, and
other young Americans before they
leave.

The world has become very small,
and in all but a minute proportion of
that world, people are miserable, and
to them life is a very serious business.
It is realized by them that two con-
secutive generations have so destroyed
the social structure of this planet
that the happiness and prosperity

Carillon to Hit
Stands Monday

The winter issue of Carillon will be
placed on sale throughout the campus
on Monday morning, March 10, it was
announced by Marjorie Ladd Brown,
Editor-in-Chief.

A substantial increase in the num-
ber and merit of contributions makes
the winter issue one of the most in-
clusive numbers to be produced in
recent years, according to magazine
spokesmen. Prominent in this issue
is a satire on the smart-set written by
Espey Voulisc; an article concerning

International House in cooperation
with the University is offering in-
struction in English to students from

attending the universities in Chicago.
Mr. Hugh R. Walpole will meet with
those interested Tuesday evening,
March 6, at 8 p.m. in room A.

Mr. Walpole, a graduate of Cam-
bridge University, is at present doing
research work here on the teaching
of a second language. He is author
of Stories from France, Semantics,
Fundamentals of English, and
numerous articles.

Recognizing the need for in-
tegrating their respective activ-
ities, campus political, church,
and several graduate social sci-
ence organizations this week
framed a coordinating council
charter and will begin function-
ing immediately.

Patty Pickett, president of Chapel
Union, who headed the integration
drive, announced that the council will
“promote greater understanding of
the objectives and principles of cam-
pus organizations interested in social
problems and action.”

The council meets in part the
needs seen by those supporting
student government on the cam-

Cigarette smoke curled lazily up
and outward, tiny bubbles danced to
the top of glasses of ginger ale, and
the red carpets and soft yellow lights
of Social Science Commons lent cozi-
ness, as the Graduate English Club
met Tuesday night, Feb. 20, for its
creative writing discussion. Members
leaned back and relaxed while The-
odore Cottrell read his “The Apple
Tree”, then leaned forward to discuss
it. Everyone there took part in this
discussion, as they will Tuesday night,
March 6, when Professor Ronald S.
Crane, Chairman of the English De-
partment, will clarify in a group dis-
cussion, the type of criticism taught
by the Department.

ny students or faculty members
iiTespective of their Departments or
Divisions, interested in literature or
creative writing, are welcomed to the
Graduate English Club meetings. The
first Tuesday of the month will be
devoted to literature, the third Tues-
day to creative writing. The faculty
members are warmly urged to join
the groups at these alternate Tuesday
meetings at 7:30 in Social Science
Commons and enjoy a cold drink and
some heated discussion.

Persons with original stories, po-

Religious Review

Chapel Union Fascist Expose
Put On Display at Book Store

Climaxing an investigation of Nationalist groups of the city,
Chapel Union last Sunday evening presented in a discussion
Courtney Barber, Jr., prominent Chicago insurance man who has
made an intensive study of fascism. His subject was “Chicago’s
Nationalists—Are They Fascist?”

“My answer to that question is
yes!” said Mr. Barber.

He went on to explain that though
the “Nationalist” groups of the city
refuse to label themselves fascist,
their policies give them away.

He then named and outlined briefly
the work of outstanding Fascist-Na-
tionalists of the city.

Among them was William' J.
Grace’s “Citizens’ U.S.A. Committee”
meeting every Friday nignt. “’’This
group,” stated Mr. Barber, “is for
everything that’s negative and
against everything that’s positive.”

George T. Foster’s “Constitutional
Americans” meets every other
Wednesday but doesn’t get as much
publicity as the Grace group.

Also listed were “Institute of Amer-
ican Economics” which gives econo-
mic lectures or seminars, “We, the
Mothers”, one of the most vicious
groups of them all, “Women’s League
for Political Education”, “Patriotic
Research Bureau” run by Elizabeth
Dilling, which publishes 15 page
pamphlets regularly, and the “Gen-
tile Cooperative Association”.

In connection with this meeting on
the nationalist groups, Chapel Union
has prepared an exhibit of literature
distributed by these groups together
with some other books and pamphlets
which may be used as “antidotes” for
the nationalist “poison”. The exhibit
may be seen this week in the Univer-
sity Bookstore windows.

Several hundred guests crowded

Sunday’s “Streets of Shushan” Purim
Carnival at Hillel House, proceeds of
which will be donated to charity.
Ellen Bransky and Joe Solevy took
top honors in the poll for queen and
king.

A Persian motif prevailed in the
gaily-decorated booths where guests
saw movies and played at horse races,
bingo, penny pitching, and dart
throwing. In the basement recrea-
tion room, dancing and floor shows
provided continuous entertainment.
Star of the evening, Zero Mostel, re-
ceived an ovation for his famous
Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr
monologue, and Maynard Wishner,
M. C., brought the house down with
his “Hello” number. Joy Fetterman,
in an expressive dance accompanied
by Roberta Unger’s narartion, scored

Campus OPW Union
Sets New Program

Members of the United Office and
Professional Workers of America on
the quadrangles have recently for-
mulated a program stating the aims
of the organization. They state that
there should be a retirement plan or
some form of social security for all
employees on campus; that wage in-
creases should be made, with par-
ticular emphasis on those salaries at
the lower end of the wage scale; that
there should be a more adequate sys-
tem of job classification and auto-
matic increases for those people who
have been employed by the University
over a period of time; and that all
employees should receive at least a
two weeks vacation with pay. The
union will welcome suggestions of em-
ployees who feel that they are not
adequately covered by this program.

the form of 10c war stamps. Twelve
candidates will be chosen on the basis
of Pre-dance balloting in stations
distributed over the quadrangles. Se-

Ever-present dangers to military communications are

By impairing the efficient working of telephones and

cutting the wires.

The long experience of Bell Laboratories engineers
in designing telephone equipment for use under all
climatic conditions has helped the Signal Corps in
counter-attacking these enemies of the jungle.

Lessons learned in this wartime emergency will aid
in building better communications equipment for
war and peace.

THE CHICAGO MAROON
Here And There

Give Us Light to Read By!

Last summer, as a lark, a group of students solemnly paraded
through the reading rooms of our several University libraries
making various tests of the lighting conditions therein. At the
time, both the people who participated and the people who heard
about it considered the affair vastly amusing. However, it did
have and it still has serious significance. Not one of the library
reading rooms on campus has adequate artificial illumination.

This is absolutely deplorable. What does the Administration
expect of those students who wish to make use of library facilities
at night? Shall they bring their own candles? Eyesight is a
precious thing to anybody, and an even more valuable commodity
to a University student. Certainly, the stress of constant studying
to keep up With curricular requirements is enough burden for
normal eyes, without having the additional strain of reading under
poor lighting.

The University cannot shrug off its responsibilities to the
students by repeating that slightly worn saw “don’t you know
there’s a war on?”. The lighting facilities in the libraries antedate
the war by many years. Moreover, materials are rapidly being
made available, especially to high-priarity holders like this institu-
tion. The least that can be done, if it is not possible to begin
lighting improvements immediately, is to assure the students on
campus, and those other people who will desire to enter the
University in the future, that definite plans are being made to
alter these unhealthy conditions.

Nor is the matter simply one which can be properly adjusted
by adding a few more bulbs to the chandeliers. Libraries all over
the country, in and out of institutions of higher learning, have
found it both expedient and wise to install reading lamps on the
library tables. The main branch of the Boston Public Library has
had individual reading lamps on its tables for more than seventy
years. This is no exception. It is full time for the University
to do as much. Give us light to read by!

My Dear Mr. Cohen:

Last week we received and published a rather amazing
letter from one Mr. Cohen, student, member of ODP, and zealous
critic of The Maroon's drama editor. Because it is so typical of a
certain kind of sublime ignorance about many of the University’s
extra-curricular activities, we feel that Mr. Cohen, among others,
should be made privy to certain facts.

For one thing, it may shock Mr. Cohen’s aesthetic soul to
know that the Office of the Dean of Students disbursed to ODP
in the course of the past academic year the sum of $1675.00.
Added to this amount for ODP use, were the total box office
receipts for the year—the accumulation of many, many 60 cent
offerings from the campus. This is a goodly sum as members of
other activities not so well endowed can attest.

As for Miss Stearns, our drama editor, we believe that she
was most charitable and restrained in her review of “The In-
spector-General.” Certainly, the financial condition of ODP could
affect the performances of Gogol’s masterpiece in such matters
as sets, costumes, lavishness of publicity, and the like. Why
money matters should have affected the dramatic ability of the
actors is a matter which apparently Mr. Cohen, alone, can fathom.

Of course, the real mystery will be Mr. Cohen’s reason for
parading his stupidity and bad taste in public print. Obviously,
so blatant an attempt to insult the intelligence of the long-suffering
campus can serve as no valid justification for an inept performance
of a magnificent play.

We feel certain that Miss Stearns’ reputation as a capable
critic, the ODP as a campus institution, and dramaturgy as an art
and as an entertainment will easily survive Mr. Cohen’s peculiar
rationalizations. '

Top Acting Marks Alexander
Korda Films At Playhouse

The World Playhouse’s two English
films, “Rembrandt” and “The Divorce
of Lady X”, both directed some years
ago by that omnipresent gentleman,
Alexander Korda, are notable, not for
the unexpected in plot or photog-
raphy, but for the excpetional in
acting.

“Rembrandt” can make no preten-
tions of being a true representation
of that master’s life, it being con-
cerned mainly with the women who
surrounded him at various periods
after the death of his first wife and
fall from prosperity. Gertrude Law-
rence as the shrewish housekeeper
and Elsa Lancaster as his lovely
country maid give really fine perform-
ances—good enough to make you
wonder why Hollywood couldn’t con-
sider sacrificing glamour for talent
once in a while. Charles Laughton
seems to have a singleness of ap-
proach to all his roles, but was good,
as always, in the part of Rembrandt.
If one accepts the film on a purely
romantic level, it is possible to ac-
count for everything but the frequent
citation of the scriptures, used to
illustrate Mr. R’s powers of speech,
his life struggles and his profundity.

Even though “The Divorce of Lady
X” suffers from a stock plot, among

In The Interests of Science

Lipstick Variables, Constants I
Would Even Faze Mr. Einstein

Other factors'are also important in the distribution ratio.
The intensity of light, “i”, has an inverse effect. As light becomes
brighter and brighter, less and less lipstick is distributed. The
amount dispensed in total darkness approaches infinity.

(This is the concluding installment of a treatise reprinted from Queens
University Journal.)

An unusual effect of Newton’s grav-
itational constant is noted in the fol-
lowing relationship. If there are only
two surfaces within range, the dis-
tribution is normal. If, however, a
third surface is near, the distribution
falls off to almost nothing. Yet, with
the addition of a fouth surface of
opposite gender to the third, the rate
of flow is twice as great as before.

Slowerker attempted a series of ex-
periments to determine the effects of
passion, but failed at first because of
transmitter trouble. In another at-
tempt the defence failed, and accurate
results were obtained. The cause of
II, passion, is as yet unknown, but
it has been shown that any amount of
it renders useless the consideration
of any other variable. II causes the
number of applications per unit time
to increase greatly. The study of
this variable is the most difficult of
all, but Slowerker’s work seems quite
adequate.

Other variables of less importance
include temperature, area of the
transmitter, and area of the receiving
surfaces. It seems that more lip-
stick is distributed in the month of
June, a period of high mean tempera-
ture, than in any other month of the
year. The areas of the contacting
surfaces have a direct effect.

Working Equations

B=(A’ + A”)e

D — distribution coefficient, N —
number of applications, T—mean tem-
perature of the body, t—time in hours,
i—candlepower, p—pucker factor.

To secure the necessary data for
use in the equations, tests must be
conducted under standard conditions.
One variable alone is allowed to vary
in each set of determinations. The
only apparatus necessary are the lip-

other ailments, Lawrence Olivier,
Merle Oberon and Gertrude Musgrove
succeed in making this bedroom
comedy worth seeing again. It doesn’t
really matter that after ten minutes
you can trace the whole sequence of
events, given the young lawyer forced
to house a young woman for the night
because of a room shortage. You
know he will try to discover her
identity, be led a merry chase, and
eventually, capitulate to her charms.

March 9, in the East Lounge of Ida

group will present two short plays, as
its third offering of the quarter. Ro-

part in Strindberg’s “The Stronger”,
and Sonia Friedman and Sid Burks
will play in one of Kreymbourg’s pup-

stick, two willing surfaces, and a
standard 200-mesh linen handkerchief
which must be unstarched. A test of
pressure, for example, will probably
require 20 determinations, all with
different pressures. The results
should be placed in order around the
edge of the handkerchief with notes
as to the surface conditions. If any
signs of passion are present, dis-
regard the results of the tests, but
continue to run them until all signs
of passion are present, disregard the
results of the tests, but continue to
run them until all signs of passion
are dissipated. As many as 150 to
175 determinations may be run in the
course of an evening under normal
operating conditions. If conditions
become ideal, do not hesitate to take
advantage, as they may be hard to
duplicate. .

Servin' It Hot

The upstairs room of the Club
Zanzibar jumped for joy last Sun*
day afternoon as Phil Featherin*
gill’s New Orleans jam session
came on like mad.

The authenticity of the occasion
was set by the first number, High
Society Rag and the afternoon prog-
ressed in its aura of pure New Or-
leans jazz through all the old classics:
Jazzin’ Babies, Dippermouth, Pana-
ma, Tiger Rag, Canal Street, and
nameless, numberless choruses of the
Blues.

The band was the same as posted in
this column last week—Punch Miller,
trumpet; Darnell Howard, clarinet;
Preston Jackson, trombone; Richard
M. Jones, piano—except for the sub-
stitution of Terry Tyler on drums in
the illness of Baby Dodds, and a re-
placement of Ransom Knowling for
John Lindsay on bass.

Darnell’s clarinet thrilled consist-
ently throughout the afternoon and
Punch Miller’s rugged trumpet veri-
fied his name. The peak of the session
was probably reached in Jazzin'
Babics (alias Tin Roof Blues) which
was flawless in execution and spirit,
and carried away audience and band
in one body.

Almost as exceptional as the music
was the crowd assembled to hear it.
George Hoefer was perfect in his
role of casual m.c.ing and contributed
no small bit to the success of the
afternoon. On hand in the audience
was Arnold Gingrich, editor of Es-
quire, Julie Haydon of Glass Mena-
gerie, Jimmy and , Mama Yancey
(Mama joined the band to sing her
How Long Blues and received a heart
warming ovation) and Paul Mares,
trumpeter with the original New
Orleans Rhythm Kings. The Univer-
sity of Chicago was forcefully rep-
resented by close to twenty en-
thusiastic spectators, including such
diehards as Lester Mouscher and Bill
Erlandson and surprises in new con-
verts Gwen Schmidt, Sylvia Slade,
and Grace Flemming. Delgato-Cotter
Inc., with their trusty flash gun all
but officiated it a U. of C. event.

Congratulations unbounded go to
Phil Feathergill, and we look for-
ward with anticipation to Bud Jacob-
son and his Jungle Kings and their
presentation of Chicago jazz next
Sunday.
Friday, March 2, 1945	-------------- THE CHICAGO MAROON

Choir Hailed

Composer’s Concert Called Success

Tuesday's Composers’ Concert brought a return to the more
successful policy of last season by devoting the program to music
of Brazil’s greatest living composer, Heitor Villa-Lobos. Although
there was no work more recent than 1932, the music is representa-
tive of Villa-Lobos’ current work.

Director of the University Choir
Gerhard Schroth has demonstrated
his superlative choral technique in
training the ensemble of women’s
voices which sang in the Quatuor for
harp, celesta, flute, and alto saxo-
phone. As long as the program listed
the names of all participants from
the Symphony, why weren’t the
names of the University women par-
ticipating in the ensemble listed at
least on their home campus?

Bachianas- Brasilerias No. 1 for
eight ’celli may be selected as one of
Villa-Lobos’ works which will prob-
ably last. The work attempts to treat
Brazilian melodic lines in terms of
Bach. Only the second movement,
however, a preludio, may be properly
considered evocative of the spirit of

Dave Johnstone

More For Your Measure

“A desperate man who feels that in order to breathe he must
break the window” is Virginia Woolf’s estimation of the modern
poet. It is, essentially, David Grene’s as he hops about the
classroom bemoaning “the apple-tree, the singing and the gold”
of former age when poetry was socialized and tamed to the tenor
of The People. Indeed, such a master of the craft as Seldon
Rodman blushes in confusion at Auden’s plea, “Sir, no man’s
enemy, forgiving all. But will his negative inversion, be prodigal”*

The poets themselves, for the most
part, pass off this condition as the
inevitable outcome of The Age of
Schizophrenia: they think they see
around them civilization disintegra-
ting into its component parts, each
part an impermeable globule revolv-
ing in its esoteric orbit. They deny,
with Eliot, their Christ. They have
lost faith in their own evolution and
deserted their house of fame for the
cave of .the classicists. It is unfor-
tunate they utter their pessimism, for
it is hard to conceive that they believe
in it; else they would stop writing.
For art demands a consummate be-
lief in one’s self and in society, as
the greater self, just as true belief
entails a constant play of the evolu-
tionary force of criticism. This rela-
tionship is paralleled in science by
hypothesis and analysis. When either
of these latter do not act, science
ceases; whenever belief and/or criti-
cism fail, art is not produced.

Eliot’s fame is even now fading;
Rodman’s, in comparison, never was.
We have yet to realize the dignity of
James Joyce and, after two thousand
years, are only commencing to probe
Mr. Greene’s Sophocles for all he con-
tains. These poets remain because
they believed in their work and push-
ed their individual art-form to its
highest possible achievement, despite
the frustrated cries of their contem-
poraries on the intellectual plateau
supported by the music of the poetic
line, yet viewing a pregnant atmos-
phere which can only be condensed by
analytic effort. In no wise should
the poet be blamed for his reader’s
neglect. The reader can only inherit
a poem by working for it, just as it
can only be written through the poet’s
intense concentration. Poetry, as it
were the distillation of prose, like
whisky, must be enjoyed slowly and
thoughtfully: otherwise, the reader

Charles Tyndale, an Internation-
al House resident was fatally in-
jured in an automobile accident
Tuesday. He died Thursday after-
noon in St. Lukes Hospital.

Bach: here, after a heavy introduc-
tion in late-Romantic style, a theme
of classical simplicity is stated over
the accompaniment of the remaining
seven celli divisi. The two themes are
then alternated. The finale, a fugue,
was presented with some thickness
of tone so that the responses were
not clear at some points. Aside from
this and a momentary unevenness at
the beginning, however, the work was
well played.

The Trio No. 3 for piano, violin,
and ’cello, brought forward Perry
O’Neil as a pianist of great inter-
pretative ability and technical power.
His digital dexterity carried the
work along at a pace which prevent-

must experience a drunken depression.

We have, then, the Modern Tradi-
tion. In place of the myths of
Sophocles; we have the puns of Joyce:
neither guilty of concession to the
groundlings in the manner of Shakes-
peare’s murders. As the general
knowledge of the masses has prog-
ressed, so has the esotericism of the
poet increased. Art remains, the
more sensuous for its intellectualism;
the more capable of rewarding the one
sincere enough to approach it: Croe-
sus still must send to Delphi for the
prophecy. •

Babette Casper

Around

The Town

“Hey,” shouted Otto, “I’m starving.
We haven’t eaten in two weeks—it’s
your duty to the Maroon to feed me!”

Thoughtfully glaring at him over
Trig, we decided to abandon Math
for Otto’s health. What some people
won’t do for a by-line!

As a just reward we took him to
the Park Row Room of the Stevens
Hotel. Here we discovered a perfect
all-round date spot. Whether you
plan to spend the whole evening over
a long dinner, or to drop in for the
last dance before twelve, this is your
ideal.

You’d better count on its costing
you more than usual dait-bait, but
for special occasions it can’t be beat.
Unlike most Saturday evening spe-
cials, there is no cover or minimum,
and tax isn’t excessive since there is
no floor show either.

Instead, we found soft music for
dancing, food that satisfies and, un-
heard of miracle, good service, be it
lunch or dinner time. Thanks to
Byrne’s new edict, there is now a new
attraction—dinner dancing from
about 7:00 P.M.

So despite mid-night curfew, Chi-
cago’s winds, and demanding oc-
casions you can still plan on a more
than pleasant time at the Park Row
without leaving too big a dent in
wallets. . . . B. C.

ed it from bogging down, as it might
have in less capable hands. The
work is dry, as are so many of Villa-
Lobos’ attempts to adhere more close-
ly to academic procedure.

The program opened with the Qua-
tuor, previously mentioned, which
was largely a display piece for
Joseph Vito’s harp. The second and
third movements employ the chorus
to emulate the winds blowing over
Brazilian plains. Mus. 2/c Cecil Lee-
son should also be singled out for his
excellent saxophone playing. The
program ended with Choros No. 7,
sextet for flute, oboe, clarinet, alto
saxophone, bassoon, violin, and ’cello,
a work which went thru three stages:
Stravirtsky’s Saare du printemps,
Ferde Grofe’s On the Trail, and De-
bussy’s Et la lune descend sur le
temple. Well played; but highly
derivative music.

University Airs
Radio Shows
Twice Weekly

The University of Chicago’s Round
Table, presented every Sunday at
12:30, and the Human Adventure,
Wednesday evenings at 7:30, are the
two radio features of the University
broadcasted over large network. They
are considered to be two of the fore-
most public service programs on the
air today.

In its 15th year, the Round Table
is carried by 94 stations in the United
States and broadcasted over short
wave to Alaska. First begun in 1931,
it is the oldest continuously broad-
casted public service program in the
country. It’s aim is to clarify public
issues and stimulate listeners to fur-
ther discussion1 and research. The
Round Table studio, located in Mitchell
Tower, is today accoustically one of
the finest in the country. The value
of the time provided for the Round
Table by the National Broadcasting
company during its years on the net-
work totals several million dollars.

The programs’ timeliness is accentu-
ated by the fact that the broadcasts
are seldom planned more than ten
days in advance of air time, and
scheduled programs have been fre-
quently canceled to permit a special
broadcast on a particularly recent
svent. For, as the time Dr. Eduard
Benes, former president of Checho-
slovakia, consented to discuss the Ger-
man invasion of his nation, the sched-
uled program was canceled and a new
one planned on only twenty-four hours
notice. The topics for discussion are
selected by the Radio Office, in collabo-
ration with interested members of the
faculty. The University has complete
freedom in the determination of sub-
jects and speakers.

The Human Adventure is in its
sixth year of existence, and is now
on the Mutual network, and its theme
is to depict for radio listeners the
contributions made by the Universities
of the World in the improvement of
society, culture and science. It is
presented in dramatized form, and is
written by various authorities in the
particular field with which the dif-
ferent programs deal. Walter Yust,
Editor of the Encyclopedia Britanica,
serves as narrator and Sherman Drier
produces the program from station
WGN.

Mr. Glamor Pants

Inhibitions of long standing were all released Friday night at
the Chapel Union Carnival. Would-be Yankees threw their arms
off, handsome dark men were predicted by the fortune-teller for
man-starved females, and club girls dashed madly around button-
holing every one who looked willing and able to spend money and
vote for a Mr. Glamor Pants. Voting was fast and furious until
10:45 when final tallies of the votes (a penny per) were checked;
toward the end, lipsticky kisses and cigarettes were offered for
pennies. Sigma’s Marty Hansen and Quads’ Walter were tied for
second (incidentally, Walter was the only candidate who rated a
corsage—one flower) while Chi Rho’s Larry Keilman, his lapel
loaded with Chi Rho pins, pulled in 5,707 votes to take the title
of Mr. Glamor Pants of 1945. Larry’s happy about his new name,
but refuses to take any gifts of lacy undergarments.

The Unwilling Few

Last week we were delivering our best sales talk for the benefit of
passers through Harper Library trying to sell Maroons. Our repertoire var-
ies from merely holding up the back page and asking coyly whether they’d
like to get a nice pin-up picture to the monologue on how good the Maroon
is for one’s soul. In desperation we marched up to one obdurate person and
asked him why he wouldn’t buy the Maroon. He backed away and snarled,
“I’d rather remain ignorant!” Maybe a knock is as good as a compliment...

Good Aim

Lieutenant Norman H. Anthony, son of Mrs. Anthony of Foster Hall,
made what he though was a perfect bombing run on a Japanese destroyer
and ended up with a direct hit on a cargo vessel which he’s ignored as too
small to bother with. He insisted his “alibi” was that the weather was lousy!

Social Notes from All Over

The formal “C” dance of last Saturday seemed to be a howling success
from all reports. The band was good, everyone looked beautiful, and the
only dubious note was sounded by one girl who said, “Well...it was a nice
crowd, but it was almost all sailors.” Hillel’s Shushans Carnival was also
voted Most Successful of the Year.. Maynard Wishner put the crowd in the
same place. Wish, by the way, wore a sign around him which read“Kiss Me—
I Like It!” Unfortunately, no one seemed bold enough to take him up on
the proposition, if it was a proposition.. .The sterling institution of U.T.
evidently is still a sterling institution despite the midnight curfew; crowds
of students have been spotted playing bridge and tanking up on the beer.

Another Blair Anecdote

Professor Blair may have collected enough American humor to make up
a book, but he’s still working on more material for a second (or so we hear).
The other day in class Point Counter Point was being discussed. Mr. Blair
remarked, “It’s obvious that this book is A.F. not B.F.,” and, when the class
looked bewildered, he explained that A.F. signified After Freud.

Our Favorite Suicide

Maude Lynn who hung herself from a window in the Anthropology office
is still making the tabloids. We read about her tragic death in the University
of Chicago Magazine’s last issue and it brings back fond memories of last
summer when some frivolous-minded undergraduates carefully constructed
a dummy, clothed her in shoes and a summer suit, and strung her up with
a real hangman’s knot. Two police cars and four plain clothes men showed
up after a deluge of calls to the Hyde Park police station.

Love in the Spring Time

Weddings in the near future include those of Martha Jackson, Marylou
Landes, and Emmy Hoyer. Ginny Nichols’ and Bob Dille’s engagement was
announced last week. Gerry Bovbjerg’s man was in last week and she’s now
wearing her ring. Pat Knight appeared this week with a Theta Chi pin
from Michigan and she swears it’s only a platonic friendship. Kelly Hall
girls must be getting hopeful too—just the other day we saw a sign in one
of the windows advertising a Bridal Suite.

Pure Gossip

Saturday will be the end of club rushing and we hope all the hair-pulling
will be ended then when the demure little rushees refuse or accept their bids.
Bill Roberts and Tor Richter were on campus this week—and Ham Craig
will be in March 1. Don Senhauser writes from Great Lakes that all his
pants are too long and the only solution to the problem is to wear his leggins
all the time. Wyvern’s alumnae party Monday night was highlighted by a
serenade by the Psi U’s. Zelda Solda, Dean Maclean’s secretary, is sporting
a new measle-bedecked complexion. Sigma Chi and Chi Rho are both
throwing parties Saturday night. The cigarette shortage is really acute—
Nancy Smith was spotted last Monday smoking something that is called the
cigarette for cigar smokers (it really looks like a piece of hemp).

Campus News

Gene Miroff found some buckshot in his meat loaf over at the Commons;
when he took the shot up to Miss Giltnor, she remarked, “Maybe they killed
the animal with buckshot.” A large explosion was heard at Kent the other
day—it seems a B&G man was doing a tinning job and decided to take time
off for a much-needed haircut which was given by one of the Kent employees
who’d had experience along that line. The head of B&G wandered in and
exploded when he saw the barbering; and the latest is that the tinner has
offered to reimburse the University for the eight minutes the operation took.

Letter...

(Continued from Page One)
that all nations strive for cannot
possibly be attained in their lifetime.
It is a cold hard fact that things will
not improve of themselves unless a
conscientious group of thinking, in-
telligent human beings offer them-
selves for this purpose. Nowhere
else than in the youths of American
colleges can the enthusiasm about the
future and hope for a good society
be found. Just as it is taken for
granted that “things will be all right”
by most of us back home, so is it taken
equally for granted that all that is
good and progressive in modern
society is dead and gone by the ma-
jority here. The youth of Germany
is perverted, the youth of France is
spiritually shot with starvation, dis-
ease* and disillusionment as is the
youth of Italy. Polish youths are
either dead or desirous only of a life
free of torture. A human being can
take only so much physical pain and
mental hardship before the will to
resist, the will to initiate bold action,
the enthusiasm required for any social
improvement is irrevocably shatter-
ed; and precisely that condition pre-
vails in practically all of Eastern
Europe and in too much of the rest
of Europe.

To me the beautiful things that the
world has given people: great stories,
and the greatest thing of all—Free-
dom—have been all the more great
because of the fight that the earnest,
common people have had to make in
order to realize them. Is all of it
going to be lost? Many of the fel-
lows over here do not ask themselves
this question: they may phrase it
differently or, perhaps, not at all, but
they feel the issue, some less eloquent-
ly than others, and the shape of our
future society will depend a helluva
lot on the answers these boys can
Mind in the next few years. Where
War has given them despair, peace
must give them hope; where incom-
petent leadership has destroyed re-
spect for authority, peace must re-
store both competence and faith;
where foreign countries have evi-
denced corruption and poverty, Amer-
ica must show honesty and wisdom,
in handling a mishandled generation.
Modern war shatters a man’s ability
to think, so give him thoughts, great
thoughts. It breaks a man’s desire
to learn things in a slow organized
fashion. He must therefore have his
opinion formed properly or else his
bitterness and frustration at the
society that deprived him of what he
felt was more important than shoot-
ing Germans or Japs might easily
make him dangerous.

Throughout all his experiences,
G. I. Joe has maintained one dream,
perhaps a false one, but still a very
sweet one. He remembers his home,
and usually it is the very opposite of
what he can now call “home”. He
remembers his girl, and invariably
the remembrance conjures a picture
the very opposite of anything femi-
nine that he can presently think of.
He remembers his native climate and
again it usually is the opposite of the
- miserable weather conditions prevail-
ing around the battle zones of the
earth. From all of this emerges the
concept that the U. S. is the opposite
of all that is ugly and miserable else-
where. It is a beautiful dream and
serves the young American well when
he needs something on which to hang
a hope, a future, a proof to himself
that it’s worth while to continue to
live. There are times when it’s hard
to decide ....

campus-wide government.

Dean L. A. Kimpton approved the
plan, emphasizing the desirability of
unified action. “It is desirable to
broaden social contacts among these
groups if they are to attain their full
objectives,” the dean of students as-
serted.

Janet Davison, secretary, an-
nounced that the council currently
includes Chapel Union, Labor Rights
Society, Y.W.C.A., American Youth
for Democracy, Negro Student Club,
United Cooperative Projects, almost
all campus religious clubs, and the
graduate social science groups.

Next meeting of the organization
is scheduled next Monday at 5810
Woodlawn.

Hobo College Hears
Students Debate
Value of Education

Hobo College, known to its members
as the Social Science Institute, was
given a students’ view of the ad-
vantages of a liberal education by five
University men informally affiliated
with the Student Forum.

Two divergent lines of argument
were defended. College Students
Harold Donohue and Harold Cobb
subordinated the social virtues in
holding that pursuit of wealth is nec-
essary to happiness. They defined lib-
eral education as furthering these
ends. On the other hand, the welfare
of one’s fellow men was called essen-
tial to happiness and pursuit of wealth
relegated to an incidental position by
Malcolm McAfee of Chicago Teolog-
ical Seminary and Nancy Goodman
of the Law School. Chairman for the
event was Philip Oxman.

Socialist Club
Will Sponsor
Co-op Symposium

The Socialist Club will sponsor a
symposium on the subject “Socialism
and Cooperatives” Monday night at
8:00 in Social Science 105. Partici-
pants in the discussion will be John
Leininger, Council for Cooperative
Development; Ann Morrissett, educa-
tional committee, United Cooperative
Projects; Pfc. Stevens Norvell, Jr.,
Cooperatives Youth League, Central
States Area; and Shirley Walowitz,
district executive committee, Young
People’s Socialist League. The pros
and cons of “political neutrality” of
co-ops will be considered, along with
the structure of co-ops, future for
co-ops and the role of cooperatives
under socialism.

Race Relations

William Patterson, teacher of politi-
cal science and race relations at the
Abraham School, spoke at the meeting
of the Negro Student Club in Ida
Noyes Wednesday night. His subject
was “Contributions of the Negro in
American History: Past, Present and
Future.” Patterson, director of the
National Negro Congress, was the
main speaker in the Conference on
Races and Anti-Semitism at Paris.

Noted Painter
To Speak At
City Art Club

Tomorrow morning Francis Chapin,
noted Chicago painter, will deliver
the opening lecture in a new series
sponsored by Poetry Magazine. The
title of his lecture, “An Artist
Paints,” is appropriate, for he will
give a demonstration of paintings
while he speaks.

On March 17, S. I. Hayakawa, pre-
eminent in the field of semantics and
author of the well-known book, Lan-
guage in Action, will give a lecture
entitled “Reflections on the History
of Jazz.” He will have two guests
distinguished in the world of con-
temporary music. Jimmy Yancy will
play boogie-woogie and Elizabeth
Jeffries will sing selections which
show the influence of jazz in the work
of modern composers.

Robert Penn Warren, poet-novelist,
who is a former editor of “Southern
Review” and at present in the Library
of Congress, will lecture on contem-
porary poetry on March 31. On April
14, Sally Benson, whose short stories
appear frequently in “The New
Yorker” will speak on the subject,
“I Could Write a Book”. This is a
strange title for the lecture of an
author so successful as Miss Benson,
but upon reflection the irony of it be-
comes evident, for in spite of her
numerous short stories, her successful
play “Junior- Miss” and her movie
script, “Meet Me in St. Louis”, Sally
Benson has never written a book for
publication.

“Poetry Magazine” has found these
annual lecture series a helpful way
to meet the increased costs of war-
time printing. The entire series will
be given at the Arts Club, 400 North
Michigan Avenue, at 11 A. M. Tick-
ets for the series may be purchased
at the Poetry Magazine office, 232
East Erie Street, or for students on
campus from Mrs. Bond in the Mod-
ern Poetry Library on the sixth floor
of Harper Library.

The number one man of campus

Horton. Norm

reported.

Coach Norgren

College Track
Squad Wins

The College Track Team ran

Working with an 18 man
squad in the University Field-
house, Coach Kyle Anderson re-
ports good progress with the
baseball team. Anderson has
placed stress on bunting and in-
field practice with Anderson do-
ing the hitting to the fledgling
players. Going into their third
week of practice, the men are
gradually coming around into
condition and working on their
throwing and catching. The
squad expects to go out doors
as soon as the weather permits.

Jay Barker is developing into the
key Maroon infielder at third base
while Lefty Hawks looks strong at the
pitching post. Second year college
man Jim Vaughn is awaiting the
results of his tests, but if all goes
well, Anderson will have a good man
at the back stop position. Bill Knapp,
outfield man and one of the strongest
hitters of the squad, has been laid up
with a bad ankle and will be out of
action for some time.

Maroon Marksmen
Cop 11th Straight

Winning its eleventh straight
match, the Chicago Maroon rifle team
outshot the Roseland Blue team, 930
to 909. Although Roseland had the
high individual score of 190, Chicago
made up the difference in the last
three places. Harry Tully shot a
strong card of 189 out of 200.

The White Chicago squad chalked
up its 3 win in 11 matches over the
Ceso Club team, barely edging out
the visiting squad, 852 to 851. Again
the University team won the match
by the scores of their number four
and five men as the Ceco clubs fifth
man shot a weak 129.

Onarga military academy bowed
to the Junior team’s score of 1785
when the Academy shot 1679. John
Stetson and Bill Bokman were high
men with cards of 370 and 362 res-
pectively. Their win over Onarga

gave the juniors four straight
tories in as many starts.

vic-

up

against a strong Senn team last
Friday afternoon and barely managed
to take out a 47 to 39 victory. The
meet began with Alvo Martin taking
a second in the mile, after which J ack
Kendall and Bob Collins won the low
and high hurdles, respectively. Dave
Hjull and Brenton Stevens contributed
10 points by winging the quarter and
half mile, in that order. In the field
events, Chuck Ferris won the pole
vault and Dave Weaver took the high
jump with a leap of 5’ 5”.

The junior team won its competi-
tion by the score of 41 to 18. Out-
standing performances were turned in
by Bob Linsicone, who tied the all-
time school record for the low hurdles,
and Patrick Byrnes, who won the 660
in 1:34 and the high jump at 5’ 2”.

There is still room for 15 or 20
more men on the squad as Anderson
would like at least 18 first string
players. Until the baseball mentor
can be sure of a strong squad which
will be able to stay with the game
for the entire season he will refrain
from scheduling a formal list of
games. The team is practicing in
the Fieldhouse every day from 12 to

2 and any men wishing to sign
should see Anderson there.

Foster Takes Two

Last week in the girls’ league, Fos-
ter fans saw their team chalk up two
more victories which gives them a
clean first place in the 19-team com-
petition which is going in Ida Noyes
every afternoon. One game was a
defeat of Kelly, 9-3, and the other
a default by Nursing Education. Tau
Sigma Upsilon scored their first vic-
tory of the season over Green Hall,
and the 11th Grade beat Green 14-13.

Sunday Foil Fencing Championship
Meet held in Bartlett. Richard Pod-
lisak and Ed Blazich ran second and
third respectively. Polisak, of former
Illini fame scored over Blazich 5-2,
losing to Winter 5-4.

Coach Hermanson had his most
agile fencers place in the semi-finals
with MacLeish, B1 a u t, Robinson,
Drucker, Casey, and Thompson re-
ceiving honors. Vaughan was elim-
inated from the finals by Sullivan
of Senn High, 5-2. Wiley of Senn
ranked fourth and Sullivan fifth in
the finals. Robinson overcame Rosel
5-1; Thomson beat Green 5-2, and
Crawford bowed to Wiley 5-1. There
were thirty fencers registered, most
of them taking out membership in
the AFLA, which now is affiliated
in the AAU.

Running in its last meet be-
fore the Big Ten Conference
contest on March 10 at the Field-
house, the Maroons collide with
two of the strongest teams in
the mid-west here Saturday.
The Iowa Hawkeyes and the
Minnesota Gophers will travel
here for a return engagement
with Coach Ned Merriam’s year-
ling thinclads.

Maroons Win 2 Meets

Chicago won two track meets in
one last Saturday at the Fieldhouse
when they met North Central College
of Naperville and the Morton College
tracksters. Morton refused to com-,
pete in a triangular contest so the
events were scored on a two meet
basis with the Maroons winning their
first two meets of the season, 51 to
37 against North General and 49 to
44 against Morton.

Seven first places were annexed
by the winning Maroons as Fried-
lander won the mile in 4:59, also
placing second in the two mile, Rust
took the 440 in .54 flat, Bokman
tied for first in the high jump at
5'4" and Russell won the low hur-
dles in 8.7 seconds. Turtelotte
made a good jump of Id'll" in the
broad jump pit for Chicago’s last
individual first place and the Chi-
cago relay team in the mile won in
3:45.4. Coach Merriam was experi.
menting with a new combination
in the latter event which accounts
for the slow time.

Next Saturday’s meet matches Chi-
cago against two teams which have
already bested the Maroons in com-
petition. Iowa took first place at
Iowa in a triangular meet with North-
western and Chicago while a surpris-
ingly well balanced Gopher squad won
the five way meet here at the be-
ginning of the season.

This is the last triangular meet for
Chicago this indoor season and the
season will officially close on March
10. Coach Merriam does not plan
on entering a complete squad for the
Big Ten match but only those men
who wish to compete. Tickets are
on sale at the present time for the
March 10 show.

e

In the New York Sunday
TIMES of this week, Arthur
Daley wrote a column on Pro
Basketball, ancient style. Some
of the slightly unusual practices
might interest you, so here goes.
Daley talks of the time Honey
Russell played pro ball in his
first game against the famous
Horse Haggerty. Haggerty
greeted Russell with a smile and
then told him “if you once wan-
der past the center line, I’ll
break your back.” That was a
quarter of a century ago.

It seems that the spectators were
so rabid that any visiting quintet
never worried about winning a game.
Its chief concern was how the players
would escape in one piece.

Honey Russell played in as many
as 5 different leagues in one sea-
son, performing in 125 games in a
single year. He had five different
sets of rules to contend with and
on one night he’d play in a rope
cage with open baskets and no back,
boards: the next night, it would be
a steel cage with the baskets 12
inches out from the boards; then it
would be wire backboards with the
baskets only 6 inches out.

The players had their own ways of
playing when the spectators got too
violent. By violent, we mean trying
to rattle the players by throwing
lighted cigarets at them or spraying
them with tobacco juice. The be- e
heckled athletes would often clam'
their helpless victims against heating
equipment near the cage. Any old
hot stove or radiator served to take
the enthusiasm out of their opponents.

When Snooks Down, another bask-
etball great, played on his own floor,
his mother would be sitting in the
third row. Snooks would get his man
into proper position and then shove
him into the spectators, then Momma
Downs would go to work with a hatpin
and do her best to incapacitate him.

In closing, Mr. Daley refers to
the above experiences as the ‘good
old days’ but says that the game
is matured now and the spectators
no longer drop tables from bal-
conies as they once did in Brooklyn
on Referee Jack Murray.



Burton, Phi Gams Win Final Games

Illinois has veteran distance man
Bob Kelly to lead them to what may
be their best chance of challenging
the well-balanced Wolverines. Kelly
has given up his pet event, the 440,
to run in the half mile and mile. The
conference quarter mile champ is ex-
pected to give Michigan’s Hume twins
a run for their money in the mile.

An overwhelming defeat by either
team is unlikely, but in case such a
thing ocurred, the indoor conference
champion would be fairly easy to
name. However, Wisconsin’s Badgers
and the surprisingly powerful Min-
nesota squad may pose a threat to
the conference leaders and with such
a meet as the one coming up March
10, the only answer can come from the
Chicago fieldhouse that evening.

Shindig March 9

On March 9th, a Basketball Round
Robin and Supper was held for all
girls in the eleventh and twelfth
grades. The time—4:45 to 7:00 P.
M.; the place—Ida Noyes Hall. Teams
of the eleventh and twelfth grades,
and of Foster and Kelly played
basketball from 4:45 to 6:00. After
the game, supper was served in the
East Lounge. Admission was free,
and all girls in the first and second
years of the College were invited.

With the close of the official intra-
mural season at the University of
Chicago, teams can be chosen for their
well earned ticket to the play-offs.
And from a look at the box score,
and from what Ensign Paresi, head
of intra-murals says, they should
really be interesting from both the
spirit and ball-play angle.

Burton 30 finished up their unde-
feated season by beating Psi U 22-21,
in a hotly contested match. The Bur-
ton boys moved way ahead in the first
half, 17-10, but in the second part of
the fray Psi U put on a last minute
drive and came within one point of
taking the game; Time, however, took
matters into its own hands and stopped
the spurt by the referee’s watch. The
game was marked otherwise only by
the excessive number of personal
fouls on both sides, and the high scor-
ing of Rudolf of the 300’s with 11
points.

The Phi Gams finished in a like
manner, undefeated, by walking away
from Hill’s Entry, 30-16. The Hill
team, playing with sleeper offense,
which throttled their oponents of-
fense, came close in the first half, but
lack of substitutes told in the second.
Patinkin and Captain Hill led the
scoring for the vanquished team,
Coffee forging ahead for the Phi
Games with nine points.

In the Billings league, Senior Medics
I are in the top spot of the Alpha sec-
tion, the Soph Medics having to be
contest with the runner-up position.
Billings is ahead in the Bets Section,
and Navy Frosh and the Senior Medics
II are tied for the second spot.

The College League play-off between
Burton 600 and Burton 800 will take
place on the full court at Bartlett
next Tuesday night, and despite the
loss of one of 800’s key men, it looks
as though it will be a spirited game.

Well, with all her experience (she’s played in summer stock,
