WHAT of IT?

SPLASH PAINT FOR PLAY SETS

I turn once more to debating. You
will recall that shortly before the
University debating team took the
floor at Mandel against the Univer-
sity of Sydney, I issued some good
advice to the three orators who were
out to spout to the death for the dear
old Maroon. It developed, things
would seem, that my counsel was just
about as good as anything Polonius
ever turned out, for didn’t our boys
go out and Ulk the Australians under
the table to win by a very wide mar-
gin? The question is rhetorical, you
understand, and the answer, “yes-,
the boys did.” The day when the
University of California’s team
comes to the Midway, and tongues
of fire will once more hang over
Mandel, is not so far in the offing.
So, feeling my duty as a loyal Chi-
cago supporter of the teams fof
whatsoever kind they be), I start
talking once more—to what end I
have, this far along in my column,
not decided yet. I just hope that
whatever I say will act as much for
the general good as the other stuff
did.

• * * *

Well, I might start off by reassur-
ing our debaters that they are good,
to remind them of it so that when the
impending conflict arrives, the boys
will not go into the fray with any in-
feriority complex, that might work
against their chances of bringing
what the football team didn’t to the
old school. For, you know, the Ma-
roon debaters ARE good. They all
had previous experience before com-
ing here to school. They are old and
tried hands at their art. All of them,
I suspect, were Four-Minute Men dur-
ing the war. I have some doubts
whether, because of this or some
other such thing, their amateur
standing is any better than it might
be. 1 wonder whether the defeated
Australians ever had any suspicions
about Coach Burtt of the Maroons
proselyting his men. Things might,
1 must admit after looking things
over impartially, lead to doubt among
some as to whether old Chicago was
not in the pungent idiom of Confer-
ence football circles “going out and
buying them” for its debating team.

*	•	*	*

This is a horrible doubt, and no
question about it. But look at the
evidence. Capt. George Gentry of
the Maroons was captain of the Uni-
versity of' Arizona last year. Max
Swiren, No. 2 man, was director of
LaFollette’s Cook County campaign
two years ago, and? I hear, spoke
for the Crowe-Barrett faction in the
last primaries. If he received money
for these services, there can be no
doubt that Chicago is debating a pro-
fessional, who, under Roberts’ Rules
and the Laws and Regulations of the
Little 19, ought to be ineligible. Mar-
vin Schaefer, the third Maroon, was,
I discover upon investigation, “on
the state championship team of Ne-
braska for two years.” Bad. bad.. .
very bad. All this looks ominous. I
hope California doesn’t protest any
of our men.

♦	*	*	*

1 had occasion a couple of weeks
back to spend part of an evening
with the Australian team, just after
■t had been defeated here. The Syd-
ney men were as good as they come,
and showed no disposition to stand
on formality. It was a good evening
all around. I was interested in what
Mr. Noel McIntosh of the Sydney
team had to say that night about
energy and debating. “What you
need here,” he said, “is more lazy
men on your teams.” This was a
sentiment after my own heart.
And,” continued McIntosh, “more
lazy men in everything.” That was
even better. And Mr. McIntosh
himself was the best of all, for
through the course of the evening
he showed even more astounding
Propensities to laziness than I was
capable of. And when a man does
that, he is a GOOD man.

“The Youngest” will be played

versity. The new unit set will be
delivered on the campus this after-
noon.	,

Under the direction of George

University Chaplain Retires;

To Return To Theology

Dr. Theodore G. Soares, acting
chaplain of the Ufiiversity since 1916
has resigned that post, having re-

involved at the end of the quarter.
His successor will be selected before
the beginning of the Winter quarter.

“I have enjoyed a very pleasant
relationship with the undergraduate
body and have come to know them in
a very happy way. However, since
the duties of this position have in-
volved a heavy responsibility in my
ten years of tenure, I feel that 1

memory of “Touches of Realism” of

manner in which Dr Soares commit-

Looks For Few Changes

“Though I look for no radical
changes in the chapel procedure of
my successors, the new chapel will
necessitate some readjustments in
the matter of class assemblies. As the
new edifice is not fitted for such
meeting the question of a permanent
chapel has not been settled,” he con-
tinued.

COLLEGE SHOULD IN-

(Continued from page 1)
students in colleges and universities
will fail to recognize the value of
true intellectual education. Many
students look upon a college as four
years of fun, as a society, and oth-
ers look upon college as four years
of athletics. These ideas of an edu-
cation are false. Colleges are estab-
lished definitely for one thing, the
class room and the study being the
supreme. I endorse the Phi Beta Kap-
pa campaign, because it stands for
a high attainment of scholarship.”

Mr. Lyman H. Thompson, repre-
sentative from Phi Beta Kappa head-
quarters in New York explained the
two-fold purpose of the campaign
which the organization is sponsoring.
It is endeavoring to secure one mil-
lion dollars $100,000 of which is to
be used for the completion of the
memorial building at the college of
William and Mary; the other $900,-
000 is to be used for a variety of
scholarships which will be distributed
annually.

subscribed toward the endowment
and that the campaign would con-

SETTLEMENT NIGHT

IN an all too hasty writing. The Daily Maroon editorially condemned
the recent Settlement Night as a poor example of campus man-
agement and a poor manifestation of campus talent. Second
thought, and the comment that arose immediately after the print-
ing of yesterday’s editorial, indicate that The Daily Maroon had
judged too off-handedly and too individually.

It is a good critic who can quench the sneer that he feels upon
viewing anything for which he is not responsible. The Daily Ma-
roon failed to quench that uncouth and unseeing sneer. The Daily
Maroon failed to consider that the Settlement Night circus was not
supposed to equal a professional show, and that the management
not only did its best but did it well.

We wish to retract a flying first impression and to thank the
Settlement drive committees giving the bulk of their time and the
best of their ability to a purely altruistic cause.

SPEAKING to the Y. M. C. A. the other night Reverend Charles

W. Gilkey remarked that college students are not interested in
world affairs. To a certain extent this is true. It is natural for men
to devote most of their attention to the things which surround them.
And insofar as the Universiy is different from the famous “Outside
world” it is natural for students to save their interest in this world
against the time they are fully degreed, prepared to embrace the
whole world in their attention.

The campus should he more aware of the significant things
which are happening outside the University community. The Daily
Maroon proposes to take editorial cognizance of those things in the
future.

Educated In London

After an early education in Lon-
Ion, Dr. Soares came to Minneapolis
in 1880. He graduated from the
University of Minnesota in 1901 tak-
his Master’s degree in 1892. He came
here to the University in 1892 as Fel-
low in Old Testament History and
took his doctor’s degree in 1894. He
was ordained to the Baptist ministry
and help pastorates in Rockford,
Galesburg and Oak Park. While at
Rockford, Dr. Soares acquired his D.
B. degree amidst his theological
studies. After serving as a lecturer
on the Bible at Knox College he was

given an honorary D. D. degree by
that institution. In 1906 he was
called back to the University Divin-
ity School as Professor of Homiletics.
He subsequently developed the work
in Religious Education and is head
of the department of Practical The-
ology.

Is Literary Light

Dr. Soares has asserted himself in
literary works as well as his lec-
tures. His authorship embraces a
book of sermons: Heroes of Israel;
The Social Institution and Ideals of
the Bible; a college text book in the
Abingdon Series; A Study of Adult
Life; A Baptist Manual; His Life
series; and numerous encyclopedia
and magazine articles.

The chapel service has been in the
University since it was founded in
1893. Charles R. Henderson serving
as first chaplain, from then till 1915.
Since then there were no regular
chaplains several occupying that post
temporarily till 1916. Dr. Soares was

New Ass’t Profs

The. athletic department has been
honored by the awarding of three
new assistant professorships in Phy-
sical Education. The three men re-
ceiving the appointments are: Dr.
Charles O. Molander who has been
with the athletic department since
the fall of 1923; Herbert O. Crisler,
here since April of ’22, and Nelson
H. Norgren, who has been on the
coaching staff from the fall of 1921
on. •

The awards place the two coaches
and Dr. Molander, who heads the In-
tra-mural department on a par in
position with most of their fellow
faculty members. The athletic de-
partment is thus brought closer into
the scope of the university’s interest.
Alonzo A. Stagg Sr., head coach and
head of the athletic department is
the only full professor on the athletic
staff.

CAGE PROSPECTS
AROUSE DEBATE

AMONG EXPERTS

Five Letter Men Back
To Positions On

Squad

Winter sports are booming at Chi-
cago. Basketball, track and swim-
ming holds major interests although
the outlook for wrestling, gymnas-
tics and fencing are unusually prom-
ising. Coach Norgren’s basketball
squad is a particular source of de-
bate for Maroon dopesters. With
five lette men back, f<|ir of which
are six footers. Coach Norgren can
have a letter man for each position
on the floor.

Captain Sackett, in preliminary
practice has been moved to the cen-
ter position, while John McDonough,
Hoerger and Marks have been play-
ing guards. In addition to these let-
ter men, three other promising can-
didates are trying out for positions.
John Black who starred at Hyde
Park High School in 1924, J. Far-
well substitute last year and Woo
Laverty, who played on the Franklin
High School Indiana championship
team in 1924. The forward Theo-
dore Zimmerman, a regular from
last year should again hold down his
position. A number of candidates are
trying for left forward. Chief of
these is Virgil Gist who starred at
Hyde Park in 1925 when they won
the city championship. Kaplan from
Englewood is another outstanding
man. Both Gist and Kaplan have un-
usual speed and cleverness on the
floor. Other candidates include Bill
Macklind and Bo McConnell, substi-
tutes from last year.

SOPHOMORE CAGERS

BOOST ILLINI HOP^S

Urbana, Ill., Dec. 8.—Illinois’ bas-
ketball hopes depend upon sopho-
mores of extraordinary brilliance.
But this does not mean that Coach
Ruby and the Illini fans are dispir-
ited as they look to Saturday night
when Illinois opens the preliminary
season against Robertson’s Little
Nineteen champs from Bradley.
Championships some times have been
won by just such a combination of
veterans and recruits as Illinois pre-
sents. 1

Capt. Pug Daugherity, forward,
and Mike Reynolds, guard, are the
only letter men. Last season Daugh-
erity did not play entirely up to his
possibilities and it is believed that
his uninterrupted transition from
foQtball to basketball was to blame.

Three-Way Tickets
New Season Plan

At Badger Games

Wisconsin has adopted a very fea-
sible season ticket plan this year.

This winter’s schedule has been
divided into three series of three
games each, similar to last year’s
plan, to permit all students to see
their favorites in action in at least
two conference games and one non-
conference.

This plan will grant 7,750 specta-
tors admission to see the Wisconsin
team in action three times this year,
as the Armory will accommodate 2,-
250 at each game. The scheduling di
the Marquette game at Milwaukee
on Dec. 22nd will also afford many
an opportunity of watching Mean-
well’s latest cage machine in action.
