TRIO DEFEATS
FORCED R.O.T.C.

Suave Easterns Compete
With Chicago Logic ;
Data Scarce

Forty-five students went to the de-
bate between Princeton and Chicago
at Mandel hall Saturday with open
minds—or indifferent ones. They had
not decided, or they did not care,
whether compulsory college military
training is inimical to peace or not.

Six debaters ascended the Mandel
platform with empty notebooks. They
had nothing to put into them. Little
scientific evidence, on one side or the
other, has accumulated on this ques-
tion. Two Princeton and one Chi-
cago man took the affirmative.

Convert Forty-Three

By the time the six debaters had
finished, forty-three of the forty-five
undecided had made up their minds.
They voted with the affirmative, and
declared that compulsory military
training is inimical to peace.

No Evidence

Mayer Replaces
Bates as Major

Appointment of Herbert F.
Mayer to the rank of Acting Ca-
det Major in the place of George
Bates who is out of residence this
quarter, was recently made by
Major Frederick C. Barrows, head
of the department of Military Sci-
ence and Tactics. The position is
that of highest ranking cadet of-
ficer of the R. 0. T. C. and is the
highest honor bestowed by the de-
partment.

Mayer was appointed because of
his military and soldierly qualities,
his tact, his leadership, his ability
as a student, and his interest in
the welfare and future of the de-
partment, according to a statement
made by Major Barrows. MUyer
is also Commander of Crossed
Cannon, honorary cadet officer’s
organization, a stud nt in the Law
School, and member of Phi Ka/pa
Psi fraternity.

“Mayer has proved his ability
and his interest in the department
many times over, since he first
entered the department,” Major
Barrows said.

How to win a debate without evi-
dence, was the problem before the six
debaters. There was no mighty array
of statistics, no persuasive table of
percentages, no inviting curve of prob-
abilities. One meager questionnaire,
with return* interpreted by each team
in its own favor, was the sum of the
data. Yet the debate must be won.

“Athletes don’t drink—that is what
thirty-three years’ contact with Uni-
versity of Chicago men has taught
me.”

From the lips of the Old Man, foot-
ball’s most gallant and picturesque
figure, come these words of praise
and exoneration for the athlete, fol-
lowing Mr. Stagg’s testimony before
the Senate investigating committee
last Saturday.

“The Volstead Act hasn’t affected
drinking among athletes except inso-
far as the general college man has
been involved. We have never had
any trouble at Chicago. Our teams

are not developed on the grounds that
athletes should have special privileges, ।
but, on the contrary, added responsi-;
bilities.”

One of the fundamental demands
made of an athlete, the Old Man
goes on to say, is that he exhibit self-
control—out of the game as well as
in it. When a man has completed
the training season the spirit of clean
living stays with him, the coach be- ]
lieves. “I attribute the success of
our teams to their adherence to train-
ing rules. There has never been any
trouble over drinking at this school,
I am proud to say.”

Edward J. Redden has been ap-

tions for membership directed to him
at the Delta Kappa Epsilon house.

The Newman society supercedes the
Brownson club, a similar, though
somewhat more limited, organization,
which was recently reported defunct.
The society takes its name from John
Henry, Cardinal Newman, a leader
in caring for Catholic youths study-
ing at secula ■ universities.

Seniors will hold their big social
event of the Spring quarter, a dinner,
on Thursday evening, April twenty-
ninth. The place of the dinner has
not as yet been decided upon, but will
be announced in the The Maroon later.
Thomas R. Mulroy and Eleanor Rice
have been appointed by the executive
council of the Senior class to have
charge of the affair.

This dinner will be one of the big-
gest social events of the year, if the
predictions are in any way true. An
attendance of over two hundred is ex-
pected and novelties and unusual en-
tertainment are being planed. Those,
are, however being kept strictly secret
until a later date.

Will Be “Oddest Banquet”

Tom Mulroy declares in all sin-
cerity that although it sounds funny
this banquet will be the oddest, most
unique, and most exotic of all similar
functions that have ever been given
on campus. All that we can as yet l
find out about it is that all the courses j
will be served in a unique fashion. J
The heads promise a “good feed served I
in a good way." Just what the nature
of the service and the program will be
will be announced in a very few days,
according to Mulroy. There will be no
speak ts.

Is Last Get-Together

"This is the last opportunity for the
Seniors to get together while they are
in the University." said Eleanor Rice.
"We are particularly anxious that ev-
ery senior on campus be there. The
Seniors are very proud of their class,
and are looking forward to this chance
at a social function."

LEADING ROLES

Announce Other Parts; Plan
Largest Chorus in

Years

Don McGinnis, star of the 1925
Blackfriar production, “Kaiti from
Haiti,” will take the leading female
role in the new Blackfriar show,
“Wallie Watch Out,” to be presented
in Mandel hall May 14, 15, 21, and 22,
according to Hamilton Coleman, who
has just announced the tentative cast.

As Prudence Chapel, he will share
the honors with Clyde Keutzer, an-
other favorite of last year’s perform-
ance. Keutzer will play the other
female lead, Louise.

Seward Covert, head cheerleader of
the University and star of many com-
pus productions, will take the leading
j male part as Jefferson. The title role
of Wallie will be played by a Fresh-
man, Marvin Hintz, for whom Black-
friar officials predict a brilliant ca-
reer.

Cullom Lauds Show

Paul Cullom, Abbott of Blackfriars,
expressed himself yesterday as highly
pleased with the cast selections, de-
claring that the leads will be more
popular in the new play than they
were last year.

Harold Carlson or Jack Cowan will
take the part of Romeo, and Wilburt
Finlay or Vernon Bain that of Julius.
Maturin Bay will appear as Went-
worth, Ross Burley as Day. and John
Gerhart as Careborn.

Announces Bathing Beauties

Vernon Bain has been selected to
lead the Bathing Girl chorus. Mike
Jelinek will lead the Tennis Girl
chorus.

Blackfriars will be Arthur Ern-
stein, Rex Malone. James Malone, L.
V. Jones, George Reed, Wright Mc-
Cullom, Wilbert Finley, and Harold
Koerber.

George Munroe will present a spe-
cialty act. Other specialties will be
chosen within the next few days.

Glee Club a Feature

One of the features of the show
will be the Glee Club, which is ex-
pected to lend collegiate atmosphere
to what Cullom characterizes as the
peppiest college play in years. The
Blackfriar jazz orchestra that toured
the Middle Western vaudeville circuits

I after a sensational success in Chi-
cago theatres, will be another head-
liner.

Chorus rehearsals have heen in
progress for the past week and cast
rehearsals have now been begun. The
I chorus will be the largest of any
Blackfriar show in the past five
years.

Takes Place in Florida

The play is a tale of financial and
emotional difficulties in a mythical
kingdom in Florida and of life at the
University, with much clever satiriz-
i ing of college life.

A PLEA FOR LAZINESS

T)ERHAPS the greatest worry of the student is the suspicion that
X he is la!y. Sooner or later ha isl^ound to become suspicious
of himself. Books remain untouched, papers unwritten; for the
disease has the infectious qualities of hydrophobia.

In the spring this malady parades under the name of ‘‘spring
fever”; in the winter it is “homesickness”; in the autumn it is mere-
ly “restlessness after the summer holidays.” But those who know—
and there are some rare philosophers among us—say that the com-
mon denominator of all these undergraduate ills and maladies is
mere laziness—infectious, delicious, idealistic laziness.

The statistician finds plenty of evidence from which to tell us
that laziness goes hand in hand with college. And, being somewhat
victims of this malady ourselves, we are inclined to agree with him.
At least we get considerable saticfaction from being so congenial.

But what if the statistician is right? What if laziness does go
hand in hand with college? Do not ideas arise and ripen when we
hold ourselves aloof from the workaday world.

Why not all be lazy, genuinely, intensely lazy while we are in

Doubtfuls

Things in general are pretty pessi-
mistic in the Maroon football camp
and the tide of enthusiasm is at its
lowest chb. The cause of all the gloom
is the age old story — ineligibility.
The coaches were putting forth their
best and the men who are out are all
working and playing their best but
next year’s prospects are still shroud-
ed in shadow.

The outcome of four possible in-
eligibilities is going to be the deciding
factor in clearing up the situation. If
they come out wrong, there will be
more gloom than ever. Chuck Duvall,
Don Yeisley, Cordon, and Togo
Dygert men who have had lots of
grid expereience are all on probation
and great fears are expressed that
they will not cofte up to the scholas-
tic standard in time to play next fall.

John McDonough, Wallie Marks,
and Kyle Anderson, the other men
wo have the passing ability, are all out
for baseball. The rest of the pros-
pects are rather poor and the casting
about for men of ability has not met
with much success. Thus the team
even though it could be lined up in
some fashion is certain to be very
much cut down by the ineligibilities.

Momentous problems are constantly
confronting the Pacific coast schools.
A while back Stanford men and wom-
en were agog over the weighty ques-
tion: Should the men of Stanford
be allowed to wear dirty corduroy
pants? After days and weeks of fiery
oratory, Vox Pop contributions and
the like, the question was settled—the
“cords” are now cleaned with respect-'
able regularity.

But at present there is an issue of I
I still greater consequence before the!
universities of Montana and Califor-
j nia (Southern Branch). And that is, I
I just who is entitled to the use of the
| name “Grizzlies?” The question is
I so important that the Associated Stu-
J dents of Montana, a campus organiza-
tion, threaten legal action, pointing
to the instance of the University of
California (proper) who, through)
the courts, prevented the Mission

Rather Poor Showing at
Ohio Makes Coaches

Doubtful

After the rather poor showing that
the track team made at the Ohio re-
lays there remains a doubt in the
coaches’ minds as to whether or not
a team goes to Penn to compete in
the relays there. The loss of Beall,
who will not be able to run, shakes up
the relay arrangements and unless an-
other good 220 man is found chances
for a win will be slim.

At the Ohio relays the men all
worked under the handicap of very
cold weather and consequently were
not able to do their very best. Burg
did well by taking a second in the
high jump,. being beaten out by an
unknown and if he keeps up his pres-
ent form he will no doubt be sent
to Penn, in which case he has the
dope behind him to win. The mile
team took third in their event, Cus-
ack doing the best time, 4:36.

The team, even though they did not
collect the gold watches, had a very
good time at Columbus. W. S. Har-
mon, who has a son at the University
here, entertained the Chicago team
royally. After the meet he was their
host at a splendid banquet and then
while the other teams tried to sleep
at the station he arranged so that the
team rested comfortably at the Ath-
letic Club.

Lafayette, Ind., April 19—Purdue’s
baseball diamond on Stuart field will
rank as one of the best in the Big Ten
this year in the opinion of Walter Tra-
gesser, assistant Purdue coach and
former National league catcher. Di-
rector of Athletics N. A. Kellogg su-
pervised considerable improvement
work on the playing field last summer
and fall ami as a result Purdue was
able to play this spring 24 hours after
2.1 inches of rain had fallen here.

Additional drains were placed under
the diamond and the rapid rate at
which the water left the field last week
indicated that they are working fine.
The closely cropped infield is as
smooth as a table, and the outfield
which once conu/'^ed uneven spots
j dangerous to the unwary fielder, is
now in almost as good shape as the
। infield.

Another help to the diamond was
the abandonment of Stuart field’s
gridiron with the completion of the
Ross-Ade stadium. Formerly, bleach-
ers had to be placed across-the infield
to accommodate the football specta-
tors. Eventually Purdue will have a
diamond on the Ross-Ade athletic
field. Purdue now has accommoda-
tions for 4,000 fans at its baseball
games. Baseball has become so popu-
lar at the Boilermaker School, that for
important games, the accommodations
are inadequate.

Hope for Better Weather After Postponement of Butler
Game Last Saturday Because of Snow
Fall; Team in Good Shape

By Tom Stephenson

Providing that it has stopped snow-
ing down in Lafayette, the Maroon
nine will clash with Ward Lambert’s
Purdue team at 2:30 this afternoon,
on Stuart Field. The Norgrenites
just returned from that vicinity Sat-
urday, having a game scheduled with
Butler of Indianapolis which it was
necessary to postpone on account of
snow. Coach Norgren and thirteen
of his regulars left last night for me
Boilermaker game, hoping to meet
with better weather this time.

Those making the trip are Captain
Gubbins, Webster, Macklind, Ander-
son, McConnell, Brignall, Price,
Schneberger, Marks, Zimmerman,
McCormick, Gordon, and Luthrie.
They are the same lucky thirteen that
accompanied Coach Norgren to But-
ler; the same unlucky thirteen that
did not get to play because of the
chilly reception given them by the
Indianapolis weather man.

Dope Favors rurdue

Chuck Hoerger, regular center-
fielder, has been confined to his home
with an injured knee. Price will fill
the vacancy. The probable line-up
for today’s battle will be the first
nine men listed above, with the possi-
bility of either Marks or Gubbins,
starting as pitcher.

From comparative scores, the dope
is much in favor of the Boilermakers,

who have won four straight games.
Northwestern, who defeated Chicago,
took a drubbing from Lambert’s nine
in the opening conference game. Pur-
due also won from the Ohio State
team in a close game last week, to
lead the Big Ten race. Some healthy
swatting of the ball marked their win
over the Buckeyes, and a total of fif-
teen hits were registered against the
Ohio hurlers. This shows what Gub-
bins and Marks will face in today’s
game.

Purdue will also be aided by the
aditional practice which the South-
ern climate has afforded them over
that which the Maroons have had.
This hoo-doo followed the Norgrenites
down to Indianapolis last week to rob
them of a very valuable practice tilt.

WHY DIDI I SEND MY GIRL TO
COLLEGE

She'd Be Safer On the Farm
She was born out in the country.
In the country she was raised.
At dawning she would milk the cows
And watch them as they grazed.
She was my eldest daughter,
And she knew her oats and corn—
But she left off toting water
On that farm where she was born.

Chorus

Oh, she said she wanted knowledge
And I thought there warn’t no harm—
So I sent my gal to college
Though we missed her on the farm.
Now instead of raising chickens
And tending to the bees
She has learned to raise the dickens
In them fast sororities.

Oh, maw, I fear her knowledge
Is gettin’ kind of warm—
Why did she go to college?

She’d be

safer on the farm?

Do you belong
in the Bond Business?

THE bond business has its share of square pegs
in round holes, the same as other lines. If they
don’t succeed, who is to blame?

We don't think the man is entirely at fault. He
probably knows less beforehand about his fitness
for the bond business than the house that employs
him — because he naturally knows less about the
requirements.

Halsey, Stuart & Co. make a sincere effort to
help college men who are considering the bond
business, base their decision on a sound analysis
of their qualifications. That reduces the number of
misfits. It cuts down the period of low earnings.
It accelerates personal development, because the
man who is well adapted to his work get*; Aspira-
tion from it.

Moreover, we support the qualifications a man
has in him, with effective training in the fundamen-
tals of the bond business, before vt look for results.
This training consists of three months' intensive study
of well directed courses in our own bond schools—
and the student is on salary while attending.
