motion picture to lx* shown Thursday
at 4 in the south lounge of the Rey-
nolds clubhouse. The film will lie
shown under the personal presenta-

also glimpses of the settings of the
far west and the scenic beauty found
there.

In conjunction with the ranch,
camping is provided for tourists.
Boating, fishing, horseback riding on
old trails are open to the guests. Out-

Prof. Allee Finds “Termites”
Undermining Foundations

Wendell Bennett was appointed
toastmaster for the Junior class
luncheon tomorrow afternoon from
12 to 1 in the sun parlor of Ida Noyes
hall. Bennett was elected by the class
executive cuncil to the position.

Mr. and Mrs. Bertram G. Nelson
will act as host and hostess for the
class.

According to George Widman, who, j
with Harriet Keeney, are in charge'

courses of 140 and 141.

Is Snell Hall Head

At the present time he is teaching
the above courses, and in addition, is
acting in the capacity of department-
al examiner. He is also the faculty
head of Snell hall, where he resides.

During his undergraduate days at
the University, Mr. Roberts was very
active in campus dramatics, and in
art circles. He was one of the orig-
inators of the Tower Players, and he
is still a very staunch supporter of that
project. He appeared in many plays
and in campus productions. Last

Perhaps many lives were saved by

the rafters of St. Paul’s church on the
Midway at Dorchester and 60th

tified as “termites” by Prof. W. C.
Allee of the University, who states
that this is the only case of a struc-
ture in Chicago being endangered by
these insects which has come to his |
knowledge.

Steps are now being taken to halt
the destruction and to strengthen the
weakened supports of the church, but

depend upon keeping it absolutely dry.

Though rare within Chicago, ter-
mites of this species are common in
nearby region*.

Required Chapel
Not Considered a

Student Bugbeai

Required attendance at chapel is
not considered a bugbear and a pun-
ishment by students of the Univer-
sity.

Although members of eastern col-
leges may wrangle and fret for free-
dom in choosing their religion the
majority of students here continue to
attend compulsory chapel once a
week, and apparently enjoy it, ac-
cording to a concensus of opinion ex-
pressed by members of the four
classes.

Because it is not a difficult matter
for students to be excused on the score
of religious scruples or working hours,
it is usually those who really appre-
ciate the weekly services who attend.
Many people expressed the opinion
that twenty minutes a week was lit-
tle enough to give to religion and
therefore they did not consider chapel
an imposition.

The question of compulsory chapel
was raised when authorities at Har-
vard abandoned compulsory chapel
and Princeton required attendance
after strenuous strugglies. Yale is
in the midst of a controversy now.

DAR, far be it from us to come right out and say that two horns
A on one auTomombileTs fi bad thing. In fact, we see how under
certain circumstances it would be a good thing. For instance, one
horn might get broken.

Several undergraduates have adopted this two horn system on
their automobiles for one reason or another. It seems to work fine.
Probably one horn gets broken every now and then, and they still
have another left to blow.

But did you ever hear this automobile with the three horns?
The one that sounds like some fantastic cross between a Ford, a
Cunningham and a fire engine. Well, it’s probably around some-
place. Sit up until about one o’clock tonight and you’ll be sure to
hear it.

Well, what we started out to say is this: we wish all these va-
rities of horns owned by various undergraduates would all get to-
gether some evening and have a real nice long blow—and then
shut up!

A WANT-AD

WE are looking for copy , for the next issue of our supplement.
Perhaps you can supply us with some.

We want honest criticisms of life at the University. We want
these in great variety. The supplement, if we have our way, will
be a forum on paper. It will be a strengthened, dignified vox-pop
column, in which “A Reader' and “An Old Subscriber” are pro-
moted to the rank of contrbiutors. If we believe that your essay is
honest, and effective without striving after effect, we will print it.
We may disagree with you—we disagree with notions expressed
in the supplement—but you are entitled to a hearing, anyhow.

We take the liberty, however, of a few words of advice. Be
scientific. Analyze your subject sanely, and report your analysis
is simple, business-like terms. Do not jump at conclusions; do not
play to your reader's emotions. Epigrams do not enchant him.
Startling statements merely surprise him. Your public is quite grown
up. Do not take your idea over seriously. You are no crusader.
The University of Chicago needs neither deliverance from a dragon
nor sanctification from a Holy Grail. If a situation is funny, laugh
at it.

If you follow some such plans as these, your story will be ef-
fective. We require that all copy be first honest, and then effective.

IN WHICH WE ATTACK LIBERTY

WHAT do you think (we asked our friend Humblawf) of such
an idea as this: Require every student to attend a symphony
concert once a week. Post a flunkey in the gallery at Mandel to
check up on vacant seats, and issue excuses only to students who
prove themselves quite without what is called the musical ear. In
other words, make concerts compulsory just as chapel is compul-
sory.

Such a scheme (we argued) would help students to keep their
balance. For a couple of hours every week, the activities man would
forget his deadlines and his try-outs, the graduate student would
forget her thesis, and the rest of us would forget our bills. We would
listen to something universal, something that reduces these details
to their proper place. However little we know or care for music, we
could not hear Mr. Stock’s orchestra and fail to understand this: that
there is in the world such a thing as eternity. We would be reminded
week by week, that there is something bigger than Blackfriars shows
and Maroon weeks and Interclass hops, something more lasting than
Monday night chapter meetings (though these last a long time),
something that means more than syntax and atomic weights. What
(we asked Humblawf) do you think?

Your idea (said Humblawf) is foolish. Students must not be
compelled to do things. Students must be free.

Are You Qoing
Into the Bond

Business ?

There is a cycle of fashion
not only for the hats col-
lege men wear but for the
line of work into which
they go.

But your job has to fit
your head as well as your
hat, for it has to fit your
state of mind.

Like your hat also, your
job needs to fit your purse.

Therefore, why not choose
one that brings not only
satisfaction in service but
in financial return.

Selling life insurance isone
of the few modern busi-
nesses that does just this.

It takes:

Intelligence, Zest
and Ability

It gives:

Liberty of action, the
philosophic satisfaction of
selling future security and
present serenity to living
people, and a response, im-
mediate and tangible, in
monetary as well as mental
reward.

Intramural athletics will get under

noon at three o’clock, when six frat-
ernities send their teams out to play
in the opening games of the play-
ground ball schedule and the first con-
tests of the I M spring program. At
four-thirty o’clock, four more teams
will take the field, thus making a busy

How much real brawn there is in
the University will be discovered
tonight when the weights competi-
tion open to all undergraduates is
to he held. Four events will com-
prise the unique contest, namely,
the hammer, discuss and javelin
throws, and the shot put. Each will
be separate but contestants may
enter all four.

The competition is the first to
held in the university but since so
many men around campus have the
muscular ability necessary it is
thought that the entries will be
large in number. Many of the foot-
ball men are certain to take part in
it and in addition the fraternities
are entering their huskiest broth-
ers. The time of the affair is from
five to six this afternoon and the
place is Stagg Field. Men who wish
to enter late can do so at the field
just before the meet.

The causes are varied. It is to be
most emphatically stated though, that

Coach Vorres Sponsors An
Innovation in Grappling

Circles

Friday at two in the afternoon an
innovation in the annals of wrestling
will be given a start at the Univer-
sity. Coach Vorres, head of the wrest-]
ling department, is sponsoring an All I
Cook County High School tourna-
ment. He has worked long on his
plans and Friday they are to ulimin-
ate in the tourney. The meet will
be the first of its kind to ever have
been held hereabouts and it is fell
that it will be very popular'with the
prep grapplers.

Hold Two Meets

Two meets will be held in conjunc-
tion; the major meet, and a consola-
tion one lor the losers. The major
affair will be run off per usual but the
consolation is to have a new ar-
rangement. Not only the first round
losers but also the losers of the sec-
ond and third rounds will be given a
chance to compete again. The arrange-
ment will be carried out in this manner;
the losers of the first round will
wrestle each other, then the winners
of those bouts will take on the los-
ers of the second round regular bouts
and so on till the best are left. Thus
everyone will have all the chance in
the world to prove his worth.

The preliminaries are on Friday
afternoon at 2:00, and in the evening
at 7 00. The afternoon's bouts will
include the 115, 125 and the 135 pound
classes and the evening matches will
be in the 145, 158, 175 and heavy-
weight classes. Saturday afternoon
the semi-finals will be held and Sat-
urday evening the finals will be rim
off. The consolation rounds will be
held along with the regular matches.

Offer Eight Medals

There will be eight medals and
three cups, tor the champions, while
the consolation placers will get four
medals and two cups. Schools may
enter nine men, two in each event.

By Victor Roterus

The University of Illinois will fol-
low the University of Southern Cali-
fornia’s lead next fall and make an
innovation in the middle west that
other colleges and universities
throughout the country might do well
to copy. The down-state school plans
on installing a mammoth loud speak-
er system, the purpose of which is to
keep the crowd at football games and
other athletic events informed of the
details of the game.

Announce Play by Play

In the past the spectator knew less
about the game than the individual
who had received the game over a
radio. The spectator had seen and
heard; but they were few who could
tell who had thrown the winning for-
ward pass, who had carried the ball
for the many gains, how long the
gains actually were, why this team
had been penalized and numerous
other details. The radio enthusiast
knew all this through expert announc-
ing, and thus the spectator justly felt
that he was losing out on something.

But now, at least the .spectators at
Champaign will have access to all
this information which ought to make
the game all the more enjoyable to
people who are not “in on the inside
dope.” During the past three years
the University of Southern Califor-
nia has successfully used in crowds
of 75,000 a machine similar to that
which will be installed at Illinois.

The loud speaker will cost $10,000
and will operate on a radio hook-up.
A man on the side lines will give the
game, play by play, into a phone on
the end of a long cord having several
plug-in stations along the field. He
will be connected with the univer-
sity’s radio station, whose announcer
will repeat the description into a mi-
crophone. Thus the spectators will
be presented with a detailed descrip-
tion of the particular game going on
and scores of other games from
groups of large horns placed about
the stadium.

LaFayette, Ind., April 20. (Special]
to the Daily Maroon).

By Harry L. SNaes

Wallie Marks, pitching for the Ma-
roons, held the strong Bdflermaker
nine to seven hits, but due to errors
and a stolen base, lost a fast tilt by
the score of 6-2 this afternoon. This
victory for the Purdue players streng-
thens their lead in the race for the
Conference title flag. It is the second
straight loss for the Midwayites, hav-
ing lost to Northwestern last week
by seven runs.

Blank Locals in First

After blanking the Maroons in the
opening frame, the LaFayette boys
piled up four hits, one a triple, and
through two errors and a stolen base
by Wilcox, trickled three runs over
the plate before the surprised Norgren-
ites could stop them. This bunching
of clean hits and taking advantage of
errors by the visitors put the c^me on
ice for the hosts. Never after that was
Maxton, pitcher and bat wielder de-
luxe, in danger of losing the lead that
he made for himself.
