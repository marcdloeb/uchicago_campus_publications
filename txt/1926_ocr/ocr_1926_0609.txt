“We feel that the classmates of

FRIAR MANUSCRIPT
MUST BE WRITTEN
BEFORE NEXT FALL

Next year’s Blackfriars show must
be written during the summer months
as all manuscripts and music must be

in

the hands of Phil Watrous, the

new Abbot, by December 1. 1926. W a-
trous believes that the summer months
with little or no scholastic interruption
enables a man to devote all his time
and energy to this important task.

The thing is that the show has tak-
en up a lot of time that could have
been eliminated if the book and music
had been in several months ahead of
time. Ineligibility has caused many
men to drop out of the show and with
less concentrated practice a minimum
amount of time will be spent.

The books of the most successful
shows have been those that have had
a campus atmosphere but that does
not mean that an off campus show
would not be acceptable. Satirization
of campus life and the people and

regulations that make up our
'Chicago offer a fertile field for
show. There is no limit to

life at
a good
which

you can carry the satirization.

For the benefit of those who live
in Chicago or close proximity, Direc-
tor Coleman will be in Chicago for
the greater part of the summer and
Blackfriars have arranged with him
that anyone, who so desires it can
call on him for help in construction
or technique. This should prove a
boon for those who have novel ideas
and lack the ability to work them up
into a complete show.

While most people come to a re-
union to give “seven for ’98,
boys,” eat a dinner, and sing the
good old songs, the alumni of
Rush Medical Collge have a more
serious and definite conception of
the occasion, as evidenced by
plans revealed today.

A series of clinics and demon-
strations, during the week of June
14-18, is scheduled for the medi-
cal school. They are being con-
ducted this year for the first time.
Members of the Rush faculty are
presiding over the groups, which
will cover ten subjects.

Briefly the clinics will be in
general medicine, neurology, pedi-
atrics, general surgery, and gyne-
cology in the forenoons, and in
the specialties in the afternoon.
They will be held at Rush Medi-
cal school, (St. Luke’s hospital,
Children’s Memorial hospital, Cook
County Hospital, and affiliated in-
stitutions.

Farewells are usually teary affairs,
rather funerial in their execution, and
yet this Sphere has only gaiety to re-
port in its farewell functions, for it is
a happy social season that marks the

quarter. If the readers can look past
the dreariness of midnight cramming
previous to the terrors of an exam in
Pol. Econ., they can live too in this
sphere of congeniality.

“Sing,” of course, is the event which
calls forth the interest of every stu-

their revolution is a pretty sight.

Nevertheless, there is a brighter side of the picture. In the
college activities are men and women who work well and unself-

BETAS AND ZETA
BEITS PLAY FOR

DOUBLES TITLE

_ Play at Three O’clock
On Varsity

Courts

Spring intramurals will come to a
significant close this afternoon when
the tennis finals will be played. Cap-
ping a great year in intramural his-
tory the. racket-wielders will take the
varsity courts at 3 o’clock this after-
noon to deckle the singles and doubles
championships.

In the doubles match the Zeta Beta
Tau team, Schier and Flexner, will
oppose the* Beta Theta Pi team, Place
and Fisher, and Place will later play
Hoppe, unattached, in the singles fin-
al. The Beta Theta couple are fav-
ored to win due to their smashing
preliminary victories.

Tough Semi-Finals

The Zeta Bete team earned their
way to the finals by defeating the
Junker-DeBois pair 1-6, 10-8, 0-3. I he
Betas reached the final stage through
their victory over the Sigma Nu’s by
6-1, 75. 64 scores. Hoppe beat Jun-
ker 6-3, 4-6. 6-4 to win his way to the
top of the singles matches and Place
won his semi-finals match by 10-8,
6-4, 3-6, 6-3 counts.

Consolation Doubles

The Sigma Nu team, composed of
Clark and Widmann, won the consola-
tion match for third place yesterday
afternoon when they defeated Junker
and DeBois in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4.
6-4.

The Sigma Nu artists played stead-
ier tennis ami consdqu'ently finally
won out. The match as a whole lack-
ed color and spirit. 1 here were good
shots and bad ones, and it lacked
championship flavor. I he winners won
the first set chiefly through rather
consistent placing, the losers hitting
the ball often into the net. The 2nd
set the losers threatened but were not
steady enough. The best tennis came
out in the final round when with the
score at four all the Sigma Nu pair
tightened up and were able to with-
stand the fighting efforts of the losers.

Aqua-Polo Artists
Keep In Practice

Frosh poloers have been put in
up a mighty fine series of competi-
tion against the varsity men for the
past few weeks. Although official
training has been discontinued, the
frosh water artists are determined to
make good next fall and have been
taking all time possible to get in
shape.

Cornelius Oker, frosh swim team
captain, has been doing exceptionally
fine work in polo practice. He is not
only fast at crawl but can handle the
slippery leather with perfect ease.
Cornie has been more concerned with
breaking the crawl record that with
practicing his mainstay, backstroke.

Dick Hough, Lavezzorrio and Rit-
tenhouse have been doing steady
polo swimming and are to back the
varsity men in future competition.
Hough and Lavezorrio will see their
first year of competition with the
passing of summer, while Rittenhouse
was one of the swim stars in last
season’ dual.

Take Pictures Of
I-M Winners Today

Winners and runners-up in the
various Intramural sports for this
spring are requested to report for
team pictures at Bartlett Gymnas-
ium, 1 o’clock today.

It is important that all teams-
report at this time and promptly
as it will be the last chance to take
the photographs this year. A spe-
cial photographer has been se-
cured, and the pictures will be
taken on the steps at the main en-
trance to the gym. If possible, the
various teams should be outfitted
in the athletic paraphenalea which
goes with the sport that they won,
as this adds to the pictures.

These photographs are of no lit-

ords of significant victories. They
appear in such publications as the
Cap and Gown, and Intramural
yearly handbooks. They are also
put on the walls of the I-M office
as a “hall of fame’’ for intramural

GYM TEAM REMAIN

Flexner, Davidson, Point
To Olympics; Strong

Squad Assured

By Gen Florez

Hoffer’s men, after finishing an im-
mensely successful season in captur-
ing both the Big- Ten and National
Championships, are beginning to think
of next season's competition. Wiscon-
sin and Minnesota have exceptionally
good teams and will be the strong-
est contenders for high honors in the
gym events. Coach Hoffer is very
pleased with the results of the past
competition and harbors high hopes
for the future.

Captain Davidson, who distinguish-
ed himself as individual laurel holder
in past meets* will have three other let-
ter men to back him next winter. Quinn
Nelson and Flexner three out the five
satellites are to be back. Conner and
Paisley are being lost by graduation
and will be very much missed since
their skill in exhibition as well as their
technique was far above par.

Prepare for Olympics

Davidson and Flexner are starting
practice for Olympic competition of
1928, when they will be finishing their
school career. Hoffer thinks very
highly of both men and believes them
to have a good chance in participat-
ing in the international tourney. While
the two stars are preparing themselves,
Hoffer is working the other men in
hopes of entering a erhw of four men
in next year’s National A. A. U.

Y., on June 28. is showing up well in
early drills, according to reports.

Coach “Dad" Vail and his Badger
crew have undergone several trial
spins up the Hudson, and already, in
only a week’s time is showing up well
in comparison with the other teams
there. Columbia and Pennsvlvania,
eastern rivals, are also working out
daily and look to be the class of the
field, along with the Badgers. There
are seven other crews practicing at
Poughkeepsie now.

It was necessary for Dean Owen
of the engineering school to accom-
pany the team east, as the Wisconsin
oarsmen were in the midst of June ex-

LEADING INDIVIDUAL TRACK MEN
OF NATION ASSEMBLE FOR ANNUAL
NATIONAL INTERCOLLEGIATE MEET

To Be Held At Grant Park Stadium On Friday and Saturday;
Wolverines and Coast Stars Among Early

* Arrivals; Stagg Enters Six Men

By Bob Stern

Now that the Prep Interscholastic
has passed into athletic history after
its recent successful performance, the
interest of the Chicago track enthusi-
ast turns with rising enthusiasm to
the National Intercollegiate Track and
Field ‘Championships \vhich are to be
held in the Grant Park Stadium on the
coming Friday and Saturday. The
meet as in former years will be held
under the direction of the University’s
athletic staff and all plans are being
made to make the affair one of the
mightiest that has ever been held.

The best of the college athletes from
every section of the nation are begin-
ning to arrive already—so that they
may have time to train into perfect
condition for their events. The Uni-
versity of Southern California team-
men. winners of the Eastern Inter-
collegiate title are here now and are
working out daily at Stagg Field. Capt.
Bud Houser who holds the world’s
record for the shot put is with them.

Wolverines Strong

Michigan, Western Conference title
holder, will be represented by a
full team of its best men. The re-
nowned Hesterv in the century dash
event, Nirthrup in the javelin, and
several other star performers all plan
to carry back their individual cham-
pionships with them.

Coach Stagg is sending six of Chi-
cago’s best to uphold the prestige of
the University. Captain Jimmy Cu-
sack, Captain Elect Bert McKinney,
Berg, Morrison. Rouse, and Buck Ol-
win are the six chosen. They un-
doubtedly will place in several of the
events. The prowess of the runners
is well known to followers of the cin-
der sport, and though Rouse and Ol-
win have been somewhat jinxed in
their recent efforts, their practice work-

BLUE BOAR

eAmerica’s Favorite Fine Tobacco

For Twenty Years
this rare blend has always won the
enthusiasm of men who take pride
in the refinements of pipe smoking.

outs have shown that they have real
championship ability in the discus and
hammer events.

No Team Scores

The rest of the sectional champions, in-
cluding Stanford, will also be here, for
the meet is open only to the athletes
who have won their sectional titles.
The primary purpose of the meet is to
settle the question as to just who is
the nation’s best in each individual
event. However, no team scores are
kept nor is any team trophy awarded,
but the man who wins in each event is
given the title of national champion in
his specialty.

Bud Houser of the University of
Southern California, holder of the
world’s discus record is working out on
Stagg Field daily in preparation for the
meet on Saturday. He has been giving
some of the ambitious Maroon discus
throwers some valuable pointers on to
hurl the saucer with the least effort.
Salamowitz and Fouche of the Chi-
cago track squad have been working
out with him daily to learn the finer
points of the art.

Practice On Stagg Field

Houser’s teammates, Grumbles and
Dye, are also furnishing the track fans
who frequent Stagg Field with some
eyefuls of keen hurdling when they
stepped the high hurdles in practice in
less than :15, which means that Guthrie
and Werner of the Big Ten will have a
job on their hands to defeat the Pacific
coast speedsters. Southern California
won the Eastern Intercollegiate last
week and looks like the favorite best
team to win team honors although no
record is kept of team points in this
meet. Houser will wear the colors
of the U. S. C. for the last time on
Saturday and will endeavor to break
the world’s record in the shot put and
the discus, his specialties.
