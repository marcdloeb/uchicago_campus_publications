SENIORS PLAN
SECONDANNUAL

JUBILEE DINNER

Ban on Speeches to Make
Banquet Unique;

Plan Stunts

Junior Jubilee is the title that was
given to the banquet of the Junior
class last year during the Spring
quarer. This year the festivity will
be known as the Second Annual
Jubilee of the class of 1926. Not only
in name will this banquet resemble
that of last year, but in many of the
features also. The most noteworthy
of these, as has been announced be-
fore, is that there will be no speeches
but some short snappy stunts, which
Tom Mulroy, manager of the d-nner,
declares to be highly entertaining.

Another attractive feature of it,
according to Mulroy is that it is a
bargain, a bargain scarcely paralled
in this city. The price of the din-
ner will be seventy-five cents -no
cover charge, no extras—just seven-
ty-five cents in to it.

Parade Begin# At 6 O’clock

At 6 o’clock the festivities will
begin with a big parade starting at
the circle. Mulroy disclaims any
connection between this parade and
the one that is going on down in
tne loop at the present time. It is
hoped by the managers that this
parade will become a precedent for
future senior classes. The members
of the senior class will form behind
the band and march from the circle
pass all the girls’ doritories and frat-
ernity houses. Thence they expect
to ascend to the third floor of the
School of Education into the cafe.

Tom Speak* In Chapel

Tomorrow’ in chapel Tom Mulroy
will give a short talk about the ban-
quet. In this way he expects to
arouse the enthusiasm that will “put
it over big.” At the close of the
service tickets will be sold by the
women of the Senior class. Hand
bills will also be passed out advertis-
ing the affair.

MERRIAM MAKES
NEW CIVIC STUDY
OF LARGER CITIES

How cities, counties, park districts,
towns, drainage districts and other
types of local political units can co-
operate in matters of local improve-
ment will be determined in a new
study launched by Prof. Charles E.
Merriam, political scientist at the
University. The study will scrutin-
ize the government of metropolitan
areas. It will be undertaken by the
committee on local community re-
search. Prof. Jerome G. Kerwin and
others will assist Prof. Merriam.

According to Prof. Merriam, a
careful study will be made of the
many scores of local governments in

Keutzer Sings at
Junior Luncheon

Clyde Keutzer, last year’s Blackfriar
star, will entertain along with Stan-
ley Young and Harold Koerber at the
Junior class luncheon at noon today in
the sun parlor of Ida Noyes hall.
Blackfriar songs will comprise the
program.

Harriet Keeney and George Wid-
man, co-chairmen of the luncheon,
have been working on plans to make
the affair a success and report that
the class has responded satisfactorily.
Assording to Miss Keeney, the pur-
pose of the luncheon is to give class
members an opportunity to get to-
gether and to give the council, who
will act as host and hostesses, an op-
portunity to meet everyone. Wendell
Bennett has been elected by the class
executive council to act as toastmaster
of the luncheon.

BIBLICAL TALES

PROVEN FRUITS
OF IMAGINATION

Nile Valley Discoveries by
Breasted Undermine
Old Theories

Professor James F. Breasted, who
has spent the last seven months in
archaeological research in Egypt,
landing in New York on the White
Star liner Majestic yesterday, de-
scribed his work as “like removing
the layers of a cake.”

The excavation at Armageddon
has shown six distinctive layers. The
first stratum, Prof. Breasted declares,
is at least six thousand years old.
This expedition to the Nile Valley
has three purposes; to translate the
coffin inscriptions in the Cairo Mu-
seum, to copy the hieroglyphics at
Luxor, and to complete the diggings
at Armageddon.

Inscription* Deny Bible Storie*

The coffin inscriptions were writ-
ten in ink on the side of the coffin
“so that the dead Egyptians could
learn from the walls who their com-
panions were.”

The work, Prof. Breasted goes on
to say, gives those people who be-
lieve in the early stories of the
ancient world no room to attempt to
prove their contentions. ‘In these
and thousands of other ancient in-
scriptions deciphered in Egypt there
in nothing to bear out the biblical
stories,” Prof. Breasted said. “I am
not quarreling with the fundamen-
talists, but for stories like the flood
and the creation of the earth in six
days—absolutely no.”

To Confer With Rockefeller

Prof, Breasted, returning with his
son, Charles, will remain in the East
a few days to discuss with John D.
Rockefeller the establishment of a
Museum of Egyptology in Egypt.
Shortly after Mr. Rockefeller an-
nounced his donation several months
ago the government put up such
hindrances as to make it unadvisable
to continue further until there was
a complete understanding. Until
this conference has been held, noth-
ing definite may be said, Prof.
Breasted announced.

Enthused wifh the result of his
labours, however, he was very em-
phatic in predicting that a great deal
of ancient world life will be discov-
ered before the research is com-
pleted.

accompanied by explanations by
Miss Langan of the work done by the
Settlement. The group of women will
also visit a dancing class attended
by the children of the neighborhood.
After the tour, the women will have
tea in the Hull House cafeteria.

Persons who wish to go on the trip
may meet either in the foyer of Ida

Fords: Problem
of East Indies

Fords present as big a problem to
the natives of the Dutch East Indies
as they do to Americans, says Assist-
ant Prof. W. M. Senstius, who has re-
cently returned from a nine months’
leave of absence, spent in the Philip-
pine Islands and the Dutch East In-
dies. He neglected to state whether
or not the colleges there were bothered
with the proverbial “wise cracks’’ that
abound on the outer shells of the cam-
pus’ tin cans.

Prof. Senstius was sent to investi-
gate the relation between soils and
tropical climates; the progress of the
methods of agriculture in the Indies;
and to study the main industries of
the Philippine Islands.

The main purpose of the research,
sponsored by the University, was to
investigate a recent hypothesis among
students of geography. This theory
is to the effect, that the soil is a func-
tion of the climate; that is, wehever
a particular climate is prevalent, the
same type of soil may be expected to

Stevens Returns to
Work After Illness

Prof. David H. Stevens, secretary of
the English department, who was
stricken with scarlet fever a month
ago, returned to the University to re-
sume his work this week.

Mr. Stevens was quarantined at the
Durand hospital during his illness.
While he was absent his classes were
taken over by Profs. Robert Morss
Lovett, George Sherborne and
Charles R. Baskervill. Although Prof.
Stevens was only out four weeks in-
stead of the usual six, he says he feels
quite able to carry on his work.

more or less note were buying fifty
cent ties, and looking at the five dol-
lar scarves, at Marshall Field and
Company. One tie—a five dollar ar-
ticle—'Struck them simultaneously. It
was of heavy imported silk, with a
swirl of black and white blending into
greys. This symphony of beauty re-
sembles, according to a mild spectator,
Pomeranian marble.

Now five iron men don’t come with
college lads singly. So the boys cam-
paigned. What they craved was three
lads, fraternity men, each of whom
could borrow a dollar. The tie to be
worn one night by each and taken be-
fore morning to the fraternity house of
the next wearer.

After rejecting thousands of applica-

Parker Hall and Esther Cooke were
elected co-chairmen of next year’s Set-
tlement Drive, Mary Harvey and
Holmes Boynton became finance chair-
men, and some of the outstanding crit-
icisms received from the seniors in
answer to the questionnaires distrib-
uted in chapel last quarter were dis-
cussed at the weekly meeting of the
Undergraduate Council held yesterday
in Classics.

The Council agreed that this year’s
Settlement Drive, particularly Settle-
ment Night itself, was a great success.
The new heads have all had consider-
able experience in Settlement work,
particularly Parker Hall, who has been
active in the organization for three

tions, the
following
desirable:
editor of

charter members found the

Al Heald, of Kappa Sig,
The Daily Maroon; Wally

Williamson, Phi Gam, news editor of
The Daily Maroon; Stan Young, Sig-
ma Nu, chorus manager of Black-
friars; George Morgenstern, Alpha
Delt, and Milt Mayer, Zeta Bete, both
Daily Maroon freshmen.

One of these days a surge of heat
will permeate the campus. And then

years. The drive is scheduled for
latter part of next November and
early part of December.

Erin Party

In appreciation of twenty-five years
of faithful services, the women of Fos-
ter hall gave a surprise party lastnight j
for Miss Catherine O'Grady, who has
been in the hall since April, 1901. Miss
O’Grady’s sister, Hannah, was in the
hall for fifteen years before her, so

tendance for seniors, the withdrawal
of books from E-ll on Friday night
for the week-end, and making several
other minor suggestions, the Council
at last completed its work on the sen-
ior’s criticisms of the University. This
scheme, new this year, is to become a
permanent feature of senior class ac-
tivity, according to Charles Anderson,
president of the Council.

In defeating the suggestion of an ac-
tivity limit for all students, the Coun-
cil decided that this was a matter for
the individual to decide. As students
vary in ability, energy, and interests,
the Council thought there could be no
fair basis for a rule limiting the ac-
tivity of a student. However, they
seemed to agree that too much cam-

EVOLVE THEORY OF
SERUM TO COMBAT
SEVERAL DISEASES

Serum to stave off the attacks of

have
the re-
experi-

meats, and are now seeking to apply
it. Dr. Arthur Locke, Seymour Co-
man. fellow of the University, Dr. E.
F. Hirsch and Miss Edna Ruth Main,
working in the laboratories of St.
Luke’s hospital, are the three scien-
tists.

Serums now in use have a high de-
gree of specificity, that is, they are ef-
fective for only one disease, Dr. Locke
explains, and many difficulties result.
The serum may de a different strain
from that of the toxin to be combatted,
even when the general nature of the
disease is known. Valuable time is
often lost determining even the gen-
eral disease to be dealt with. A serum
effective against all bacteria toxirfs
could be applied at once, he points out.

Specificity in a serum is directly
proportional to a certain “binding sub-
stance” which exists in the unit of
serum, according to the new theory.
Therefore, it has been concluded, re-
duction of the binding substance will
increase the avidity of the serum, or
give it a wider range of effectiveness,

and the problem upon which the
of scientists are now working is
of producing a serum in which
binding substance is minimized.

SHOWS IN TOWN

In Which Bernard Granville, Actor and Idealist, is Interviewed
By Crouch and Trumbull

gERNARD GRANVILLE is a man of ideals. It is the popular con*
U ception, fostered in the Methodist Church basement, Schlogl's
restaurant, and other strongholds of the old respectability, that a
man cannot be both an actor and an idealist at one and the same
time. Yet Bernard Granville, we say, undoubtedly is. Beneath his
veneer of grease paint (if we may put it so) there beats a heart at-
tuned to the finer things of this life. Methodist as we are, we could
not but recognize this fact, and we accordingly forebore giving him
one of the little tracts, ‘'God’s Red Lights,” which the good pastor
has authorized us to distribute when there are souls to be reclaimed.

Mr. Granville is at present presenting his art for approval in
Castles in the Air” downtown, and a senile doorman made him
fall easy prey to a determined interviewer. (But then all interviewers
are determined). Mr. Granville wore a fur coat, a grey suit, and
his habitual knowing look when he was, figuratively speaking, col-
lared. He made little show of resistance, and, better still, he started
to talk.

‘Musical comedy,” he said, “moves in cycles of twenty years
or so; the type material and music of the Gilbert and Sullivan oper-
ettas of the Nineties are again finding expression in shows like "Cas-
tles In the Air” and “The Student Prince.”

“English actors and English humor are of entirely the same
cast an American; when one talks about the ’English sense of hu-
nor’ disparagingly,” continued Mr. Granville, with a professional
lift to his left eyebrow, ‘‘one takes a body blow at the same time at
the Ameircan sense of humor, for one is the other, and both are the
same, if you quite follow me.”

Then Mr. Granville’s idealism came to the surface. “It irks me,”
he said, ‘‘to see contemporary dramatists looking to the gutter for in-
spiration for their plays. I believe that it is impossible for the musi-
cal comedy to entertain without playing for the muffled snicker, in-
stead of the open, wholehearted laugh, for the applause of our bas-
er parts, instead of the approbation of our better natures. It is my
earnest opinion that every play should tend to stimulate our moral
natures, a view held in common with me by the great Phineas Taylor
Barnum.

“I regret to see a dramatist of the caliber of Eugene O’Neill
subverting his genius to the level of the lower depths, to which he
invariably goes for his themes. I hold the belief, however, that
O’Neill will see the error of his ways and mend them, and that he
will soon become a force of moral value to the community. “Yes,
indeed,” he summed up, rising to his feet, “I am counting on his sup-
port in the advance towards idealism and morality in the theater.
You will pardon my abrupt departure,” added Mr. Granville, sid-
ling out the door, to follow what looked strangely like the “third
from the left,” ‘ I must have my moments of privacy, in which 1 can
dream, I can build my castles in the air.” But why did he choose the
Town Club to build them in, and why the third-from-the-left to build
them with? And why were we there? There are mysteries, our
friends.

FOUR TEAMS WIN OPENING CONTESTS

Track Coaches Decide Not to Enter Chicago in Penn State Relays

ANTON BURG TO
BE ONLY LOCAL

ENTRY TO PENN

Send Entire Team Except
Burg to Drake

Races

Chicago is going to Penn. But not
as was first expected in a massed
track team; instead only one track
athlete is carrying the Maroon col-
ors into the big Penn Relays. Chi-
cago will also be represented at Des
Moines. Twelve or thirteen track-
men will go there to compete in the
various events of the Drake Relay
Carnival. Thus although the team
will be rather split Chicago men
will be at the two most important
meets.

27th Year At Penn

Once again thus the Maroons will
be contestants at Penn. Chicago was
the first western school to send her
athletes to the eastern affair and it
was largely through her support that
the meet became a nation one. This
will be the twenty-seventh year that
Chicago has completed. And although
only one man Anton Burg, is making
the trip he is expected to finish high
up among the place winners. He is
entered in the high jump, his special-
ty and if he holds true to form will
probably take first in that event.

The relay team js not going to
Ph^adelplua to take part in the
medley because no man has been
found to take the place of Les Beall.
For a while it was thought that Stu
Spence would do for the place but
he has been declared ineligible; so
Coach Stagg has decided not to send
the medley team to Penn but rather
to break it up and send other teams
to the Drake event.

Relays to Drake

The half mile and four mile relay
outfits will go to Des Moines togeth-
er with several of the indirtdual per-
formers. McKinney, Kerwein, Mic-
kleberry, L. E. Smith, Armstrong
and Weddell are to make up the half
mile group; four of them will run
on the relay and four will run in the
220 dash; which of the men are to
twice has not been decided. The
four mile team will be composed of
Capt. Cusack, Hegovich, and Hitz.
That is the order in which they fin-
ished the event at Ohio. Trials for
the weights were held last night; it is
probable that Hobscheid, Oldwin,
and Rouse will be the weight men
to go.

The teams will probably leave to-
night for the prelims on Friday. Al-
though they are not expected to do
exceptionally well, they will no
doubt show in their respective
events.

FORMER MEMBER OF

In the pitching box, from where
he hurls curves with skill and pre-
cision he is known as a freshman
mound prospect but in public life he
is none other than former State Rep-
resentative Arnold of the Illinois
legislature and student at he Uni-
versiy. Mr. Arnold who is married
and he father of two children en-
tered the university last fall to ob-
tain a university degree, specializing
in political science. But when he
turned out for the frosh diamond
team, he showed that he is just as
much acquainted with a baseball as
with parliamentary procedure, the
green shirters gasped with astonish-
ment. Yes, he is a righthander.

Coaches Abolish

Football Leader
at Stanford U.

Abolition of active football captains
was effected at Stanford University by
the executive committe of the student
body. Hereafter the position will be
honorary and only awarded at the end
of the season. An active field captain
will be appointed for each contest by
the coaches.

Initiative for this move came from
the coaches. They favor the plan be-
cause it will give them more freedom
in the selection of men to play in each
particular game.

The inovation receives the support of
the Daily Palo Alto.

The method of choosing captains in
advance has not worked out to the
satisfaction of all. After a player is
selected he may go into a slump. As
a result, the team benefits little by his
leadership, and in some cases actually
suffers, due to the justifiable hesitation
on the part of a coach to ‘bench” the
captain of his squad.

The following conflicting opinions
were among the many given in the
Daily Californian, when the news
reached the University of California:

Benton W. Holmes, ’25, captain of
the 1926 varsity basketball team: "I
think that the Stanford plan is better.
After a man has been elected captain
for a season he is apt to fall down.
People expect a captain to be far bet-
ter than the best of his men. After
all, a captain is not much more than
a figurehead.”

F. L. Kleeberger, chairman of the
physical education department: “The
system adopted at Stanford puts too
much power in the hands of coaches
that are not, as a rule, graduates of
the university at which they are coach-
ing. They are older than the players
and consequently see things differently.
Team memebrs, themselves, are the
only ones who should select their own
leaders.

GYMNASTS GATHER TO REAP THE
- REWARD OF LONG AND HARD WORK

By Victor Roterus

Coach Hoffer’s gymnasts will put
the official and proverbial lid on their
season when they will stage their last
meet tonight—at Hutchinson Com-
mons where they will gather to grab
and grunt at the annual banquet. And
as usual there will be a horde of med-
als presented—conference champion-
ships, national championship, individ-
ual championship and others which no
one can justly grudge them for, as any
team that performs as consistently and
satisfactorily as this group of athletes
is deserving of all the insignia that is
available to honor gymnastic tri-
umphs.

It is hardly necessary to dwell on
the past season. All that need be said
is that the team went through a re-
markable season, winning the confer-
ence title at Lafayette, and beating
the University of Pennsylvania for na-
tional inter-collegiate honors.

Davidson, a sophomore this season,
was elected captain as a reward for
his wonderful work, throughout the
year of the Big Snow. Davidson is
adept at the horizontal bar, parallels,
rings and tumbling; and Coach Hoffer
predicts a great season for him next
year in the horse event which he is
now rehearsing. So all in all, he well
might be termed versatile.

DIAMOND SQUAD
DRILLS FOR TILT

WITH HAWVEYES

Vogel’s Proteges Tough
Foe for Maroon

Nine

With two consecutive defeats in
their first two Conference games, the
Maroon nine will endeavor to ring
up their first win when they clash
with Otto Vogel’s powerful ball toss-
ers at Iowa City on Saturday. The
warm weather that the squad has
had for he last few days should be
conducive to better baseball than
they have displayed hitherto.

Blame Error* For Losses

Errors and inability to hit in the
pitches are blamed for the losses
against the Purple and the Boiler-
makers. The Norgrenites outhit
Purdue, but the hits were too widely
scattered to produce runs. Last
year’s regulars are doing all the
hitting, the new men having as yet
failed to show any promising stick-
work. The stocky Brignail, McCon-
nell, and Webster are the only men
who have found their batting eyes.
The timely wallops of Red Cunning-
ham have been sadly lacking. With
the return of Churck Hoerger, who
is ill and Kyle Anderson, who is on
crutches as a result of a twisted an-
kle, Maroon hopes will jump up a
notch.

Gubbins On Mound

Gubbins will go to the mound
against Iowa, and should have better-
luck. The diminutive southpaw was
not right in the frigid weather
against Northwestern, and if the
weather is warm his slans should
prove difficult for the lowans. The
Hawks are in great trim after a
southern trip and a Avin 'is pre-
dicted for them.

Others at the banquet will be Ben-
son, Connor, Flexner, McRoy, Nelson,
Paisley, Stevenson, Neubauer, Collins,
Sissman, ami retiring captain Jerry
Quinn. And only two of this group
will not be present at next year’s ban-
quet when, undoubtedly, another flock
of championships will be celebrated.
Jimmy Connor and Paisley will be
graduated this Spring. Connor was
recognized as the best tumbler in the
land.

Davidson, Flexner. Nelson and
Quinn wil be the big guns of next
year’s team, but plenty is expected
from the others. So it seems as if
there is a great deal of justification for
rumor that next year they will con-
tinue their monotonous string of titles.

Plan 4th Annual
Fencing Meet for

Saturday, May 8

On the evening of Saturday, May
8th, at Bartlett gymnasium, 57th street
and University avenue, the University
of Chicago will hold its fourth annual
fencing meet, open to all amateurs of
Chicago and vicinity. There will be
bouts in novice, junior and senior
classes in foils, sabres and duelling
swords as well as a special event in
foils for ladies.

Award Prize Ribbons

Prize ribbons will be awarded for
first, second and third place in each
event. No entry fee is required and
Entries may be made until 7:30 p. m.
when the bouts will begin. It is ex-
pected that there will be a large at-
tendance from schools and athletic
clubs, as well as from the University.
A special foil competition, limited to
high school boys, will be a feature of
the meet.

The University wishes to encourage
the spreading interest in the sport,
which is shown by the fact that eleven
Chicago high schools have added fenc-
ing to their athletic program, and that
the Illinois Fencer’s League is now
completing its organization in this city.

Divide Entries in Three Classes

The three classes into which fencers
are divided represent degrees of ex-
perience. A novice is a fencer who has
never taken a prize in an open com-
petition for novices, a junior a fencer
who has won first place in an open
Competition for novices, and a senior
a fencer who has won first or second
place in an open competition for jun-
iors. This classification is designed
to act as a hardship and to encourage
the inexperienced fencer to test his
ability in competition against oppon-
ents of his own amount of training.

Following are the important rules
which vary from A. A. F. rules:

1.	Infoil and sabre the contestant
first scoring five points is the winner;
contestants change sides when one has
scored three points.

2.	A riposte counts only one point.

3.	In foil the target is the whole
body from the collar to waist, and
sword-arm to the elbow. A stop-
thrust on the arm is a foul, as is also a
slap with the point.

SIGMA CHI, PHI SIGMA DELTA, PHI
GAMMA DELTA AND T. S. 0. COME
THROUGH WITH CLEAN VICTORIES

Sigma Chi Is Victor Over Lambda Chi Alpha, 13-8, in Only
Close Tilt of the Day; Few Spectators
Watch Games

By Tom Stephenson

Playground ball was fittingly
ushered into the annals of Intra-
Mural Sportdom yesterday afternoon
when the spring athletic program
opened with eight Fraternity teams
sending their nines forth to battle.
After the first day’s play was over,
the four teams who remained un-
defeated were those representing
Sigma Chi, Phi Sigma Delta, Phi
Gamma Delta, and Tau Sigma Omi-
cron. The four who got away to
bad starts were Pi Phi Pi, Lambda
Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa Psi, and Alpha
Sigma Phi. The Kappa Nu-Delta
Sigma Phi contest was postponed.

Heavy Hitting I* Feature

Heavy hitting characterized every
game, all of the winning teams gar-
nering double-digit scores, and only
one nine, the Phi Psis, being held
scoreless. Most of the hurlers
showed signs of newness, and the
batters made use of this fact by
slapping the ball for two and three
base hits with regularity. Bartlett,
tPhi Gpm, and Caplow, Phi Sig,
were the class of the hurlers, and
expert work by them made their
teams look as formidable, contenders
for the Beta and Alpha League
championships, respectively. Scott,
Sigma Chi, also pitched a good
game.

Sig Chi Takes Close One

Closest and most exciting of all
the games was the 13 to 8 victory of
Sigma Chi over the Lambda Chis.
The Sig Chis took the lead in the
first inning and kept it until the
end, but were constantly threatened
by the Lambda Chis, especially in
the first half of the fifth, when the
latter brought in four runs to cut
down the Sigma Chi lead to a 11-3
score.

The Sigma Chis tightened up
however, and cinched the game by
cool, but effective playing. Scott
and Glywn formed the winning bat-
tery, while Keller and Kreuger did
the heavy work for the loosers. Col-
lins, Frauf, Glywn and Stromer all
scored two or more runs for Sigma
Chi, while Martin, Abrahamson, Ful-
rath, Norberg and Gillispie were the
Lambda Chi Alpha point-getters.

Phi Pi Phi Lose, 10-2

Phi Gamma Delta won from Pi
Phi Pi by a 10 to 2 count. Von Am-
mon first up to bat, scored right off
the bat and put the Phi Gams into
a lead that was never lost. The ex-
pert hurling of Johnny Bartlett was
a great factor in this, while some
heavy hitting in the fourth, fifth
and sixth inning gave the winners a
big lead.

Phi Psi Shut Out

Phi Sigma Delta, led by the shut-
out pitching of Caplow and Priess,
walloped the Phi Psis by a 14 to 0
score. No scoring by either side was
registered until the last of the third
inning, when Priess brought in three
runs with his home-run swat. He
repeated with another in the fourth
inning, and the Phi Psi support weak-
ened to let in several runs. Woehler,
the losing hurler pitched a ^ood
game, but was not backed up very
well by his mates.

Few Players

Handicapped by a scarcity of play-
ers, the Alpha Sig nine was forced
to defeat at the hands of the Tau
Sig outfit by a 17 to 2 count. The
winners started out with a first inn-
ing “rally” which netted them 7
runs, and repeated in the third inn-
ing with five more. In the meantime
some more Alpha Sig players ar-
rived on the scene, and with a full
team put up a good battle for the
remaining innings of the contest.

THE DAILY MAROON, THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 1926

RUINED

She was a pure and lovely girl of
sweet sixteen; no one had ever kissed
her except the iceman—and he was :
her brother.. Her mother had gone to I

heaven, and her daddy was no longer
on this earth, so she was an orphan,
but she had little brothers and sisters
to take care of... One day a wicked

travelling salesman called at the door
and asked for her mother, and when
told mama was in heaven, he said,
“Oh, you’ll do for mama,” and he
started to sell her a vacuum cleaner.

Now like all pure and lovely girls of
sweet sixteen, she always wore a neat
white dress—the only one she had—
which served to enhance the purity of
this naive little maid. It happened
as our heroine and the wicked travel-
ling salesman were alone in the parlor,
talking vacuum cleaners, her little
brother came in from making mud
pies. Innocently he parted the cur-
tains and entered the room. What did
he see there? * * * At that in-
stant a hysterical scream was heard,
and the pure girl cried, “Oh, naughty,
naughty!” Then the wicked travelling
salesman rushed out the door with his

vacuum cleaners under his arm.
Ruined! The horrible truth must dawn
on you, gentle reader. That child had
ruined her only white dress with his
muddy hands.

ON the west wall of the new Divin-
ity chapel we find this admirable senti-
ment to inspire us:

Ye Shall Know The Truth And The
Truth Shall Make You Free. Of
course, translated this means:

If You Have The Lowdown On
Some Things Around This University,
You Are Free To Get Away With ,
Murder.

testants in the history of the poster
conests, the competition for honors
was extremely close, according to
Paul Cullom, Abbot of Blackfriars,
and the selection was most difficult.
Savidge’s poster, however, was chos-
en as the most typical of the Uni-
versity life portrayed in the show’.

A close comeptitor for honors was
Miss Frances Owen, the only woman
to submit a poster. Among the
others whose work received favor-
able criticism were Carl Lippe. Ev-
erett Lowry William Cotant, Ame-
dee Cole. Frederic Bager, James
Root, and Rudolph Samuels

The posters will be placed on ex-
hibition in Harper W31.

Chorus rehearsals are now pro-
gressing rapidly, and Hamilton Cole-
man, the director, declares that the
choruses will be the snappiest of the
year. The Tag-Along chorus is at-
tracting especial attention.

New specialty acts are still being
chosen. Jack Kinsey, who appeared
in the Settlement Night program,
will do a Charleston act. Harold
Koerber and Stanley Young will give
a vocal duet with ukelele accom-
paniment.

be found. It would follow from this
hypothesis that there would be a dis-
tribution of soils in a tropical climate
according to elevation as is found in
certain latitudes. In hunting for ma-
terial, Prof. Senstius had to climb
mountains ranging in height from six <
to eleven thousand feet. He says, “I '
found that field observations do show '
a partial confirmation of the theory
but more study needs to be made to
give a final conclusion.” .

In the Dutch East Indies conditons

are considerably changed from what
they were eight years ago, said Prof.
Senstius. Every one has prospered so
that even the natives ride in American
made automobiles. The Ford, Dodge
and Buick are the most prominent.

In the Philippine Islands the main
industries are the raising and manu-
facturing of sugar, lumber, and Ma-
nila hemp. The plantations are not as
efficiently managed as are the factories.
This may be due to the fact that the
factories are managed and controlled
by Americans, for the most part, while
the plantations are controlled by the
natives.

While on his tour Prof. Senstius
gave several lectures. While in Manilla
he spoke to the Agricultural College,
Los Banos, and to the Philippine scien-
tific society. In Java he spoke to the
experiment station workers, planters,
and a gathering of the general public,
on the progress in geography teaching
in this country.
