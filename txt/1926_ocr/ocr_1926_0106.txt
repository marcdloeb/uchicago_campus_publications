NEW BUILDINGS
MARK ADVANCE

OF YEAR 1925

Point to Medical Group In
Resume of Past

Year

y

Officials of the University, review-
ing calendar year of 1925, point to
the beginning of the great School of
Medicine buildings as the chief physi-
cal symbol of progress.

In a statement President Mason de-
clared that “with the beginning of con-
struction on these buildings, and the
dedication and occupation of the Raw-
son laboratory of Medicine and Surg-
ery on the west side, our medical pro-
ject is in actual process of realization.
This means an epoch of medical educa-
tion in the middle west of inestimable
importance.”

Name Buildings

The medical group comprises the
Albert Merritt Billings Hospital, to-
gether with the Max Epstein DisfL.T-
sary; also buildings for surgery, medi-
cine, pathology, physiology and physi-
ological chemistry and pharmacology.
Ground was broken last May, and con-
struction proceeded rapidly. The cor-
nerstone of the hospital was laid last
October. It is estimated that four
years or more may be required to com-
plete these buildings, which involve an
estimated cost of about $4,500,000. Or-
ganization of the staff has been furth-
ered by appointment of Dr. D. B.
Phenister as professor of surgery and
Miss Anna Wolf superintendent of
nurses.

In emphasizing the medical group,
officials of the University at the same
time assign due importance to other
work which brings the total cost of
buildings undertaken or completed past
the $8,000,000 mark. Major buildings
include the $1,700,000 University chap-
el whose foundations are being laid;
the completed Theology building and I
the Joseph Bond Chapel of the Divin-1
ity school; the Rawson laboratory, re-1
cently dedicated; and the Whitman
laboratory of Experimental Zoology,
the gift of Prof, and Mrs. Frank R.
Lillie. In addition, ground has been
broken for Wieboldt hall, which is to
be devoted to the study of modern
languages, and of the fieldhouse for
indoor sports.

Development Fund Increase

Funds for all these buildings, except
Wieboldt hall, were obtained either
prior to or apart from the development
campaign, which has brought to the
University pledges of nearly $6,000,000,
not counting the conditional gift of
$2,000,000 by the General Education
Board of New York City. The total
of all contributions and pledges, includ-
ing such special gifts as the $1,000,000
given by Douglas Smith for the medi-
cal foundation bearing his name, and
the $1,000,000 given by John D. Rock-
efeller, Jr., to the Divinity school, is-
nearly $10,000,000. I'p the words of

Chicago Symphony Brings Down
Laughter with Humorous Sketch

By Alfred V. Frankenstein

A small miracle was worked yester-
day afternoon at Mandel hall. The
Chicago Symphony orchestra played a
piece of music that is intended to be
funny, the march of fauns in the bal-
let "Cydalise,” by Pierne, and the audi-
ence really laughed.

The orchestra’s big offering was the
“Sheherezade” suite of Rimski-Korsa-
kov. It was played presumably because
university concerts are, theoretically,
educational. But “Sheherezade,” alas,
is the only thing of Rimski-Korsa-
kov’s ever played on educational pro-
grams. Mr. Stock went exploring in
the unexplored and gorgeous sea of
Rimski-Korsakov recently, and fished
up a golden fish, the “ Christmas Eve”
suite Had he played this instead of
the inevitable, inescapable “Shehere-1

RUSH MEDICS RAISE
$190,000 FUND AS
GIFT TO CAMPAIGN

More than $190,000 has been
raised by the alumni of Rush Medi-
cal College in their drive to add
$250,000 to the Development fund
of the University, of which Rush
College is now a part, it was an-
nounced by Dr. Ralph Webster, di-
rector of the campaign. Dr. Web-
ster and his son, Ralph have arrived
in Chicago after spending several
months in the Orient with the Ma-
roon baseball team for which Ralph
is first string catcher. The Maroons
returned to Chicago several weeks
ago, but Dr. Webster and his son
lingered in Manila, P. I., arriving
last night.

Dr. Webster will resume his posi-
tion as instructor at Rush college
next quarter and will start at once
working to raise the remaining $60,-
000 of the Rush quota. The faculty
members of Rush college have sub-
scribed $61,000, Dr. Webster an-
nounced. The $190,000 total repre-
sents the subscription of 1.037 per-
sons.

PROF. COUNTS

JOINS FACULTY

Noted Yale Professor Is Add-
ed to Staff

Dr. George S. Counts, Prof, of Ed-
ucation at Yale university, who is to
become a member of the Faculty of
the School of Education of the Uni-
versity on July 1, 1926, will devote him-
self to advanced work in educational
sociology. Prof. Counts is a graduate
of Baker university and in 1916 took
his Doctor’s degree at the University.
He has held professorships at the Uni-
versity of Delaware, Harris Teachers
College, and the University of Wash-
ington, and for the past four years has
been at Yale, where he attained the
rank of full professor. He was recent-
ly a member of the commission which
made a survey of the Philippine . 1s-
tands and he is now chairman of a
committee on investigations in co-
operation with the United States Bu-
reau of Education.

Prof. Counts has published mono-
graphs on arithmetic and secondary
school population and is joint author
with the late Prof. Chapman of a book
entitled “Principles of Education.” He
has in press a monograph dealing with
the course of study in American high
schools which was prepared after he
had visited high schools in all parts
of the country under the auspices of a
committee of the Commonwealth
Fund.

Faculty members of the school of
education expressed their pleasure at
the news of Prof. Counts’ return to the
University as an addition to their num-
ber, and welcome him both for his
personality and prestige.

zade,” he might have done some- real
educational work.

After it, he gave us the pleasant
“Waltz Triste” of Sibelius, another of
the great unperformed, whose every
note is stamped with the genius of one
of the great composers.

He opened with the prelude to
“Hansel and Gretel,’ and closed with
some selections from Berlioz’s “Faust.”
It is rather a curious fact that the
Goethe version of “Faust” has been set
to music by two Frenchmen and one
Italian. Berlioz pictures in his opera
a distinctly French devil, and some dis-
tinctly French creatures of Hell. His
dances of cylphs and will-o-the-wisps
are far too heavenly. The dance of
the sylphs, is, f believe, the most per-
fectly formed melody in the world, and
I expect to get murdered for saying
so. I

HARDING TELLS
RADIOAUDIENCE
OF CONFERENCE

Denominational Meeting Ad-
vises New Attitude for

Churches

Surprising student reactions and im-
pressions of church acitvities which
found expression in the recent Inter-
denominational conference were de-
scribed by Glenn Harding, a graduate
student of the University, last night in
a radio talk relayed from the broad-
casting station in Mitchell tower.

The conference which was in ses-
sion in the First Methodist Episcopal
church of Evanston, Ill., during the
last week of December, was the first
student conference of its kind of
national significance, as more than 809
students representing the different de-
nominational groups were present.
About 300 student advisers connected
with denominational groups of educa-
tional institutions were invited to be
present but did not take part in the
proceedings.

Consider Live Questions

Discussions of pertinent religious
questions commanded the attention of
the representatives at each session.
Among the problems considered were:
Denominationalism, the relation of
church to industry, to the racial situa-
tion and to war and the missionary
program.”

On the last day of the conference
resolutions were presented regarding
these situations, Harding explained. It
was recommended that denominations
should be unified and that young peo-
ples’ societies should be standardized
in the same manner.

Present Resolutions

Resolutions criticizing the church’s
attitude in the industrial racial and war
situations were adopted. A missionary
program calling for an exchange of
representatives was approved. Thus
when the United States sends mission-
aries to China, the Chinese should have
a right to send missionaries to the
United States, in return.

It was recommended that students
get direct contact with the laboring
classes and the experience of laborers,
that they should limit themselves to
expenditures of the average income.
Industry should be put on a basis of
production for service rather than for
profit.

The conference recommended that
the new Dyer anti-lynching bill be
passed, and that development of
friendly intercourse between races be
encouraged through inter-racial groups
and a study of the history and achieve-
ments of the races.

W. A. A. ANNOUNCES
CLOSE OF CONTEST
FOR ORIGINAL SONGS

The song contest to be sponsored
by W.' A. A. will close Monday, Jan.
11, instead of Thursday, Jan. 4, as was
previously announced, and all contri-
butions must be submitted on or be-
fore that date.

The songs may be mailed either to
the W. A. A. office in Ida Noyes hall
or to Eleanor Fish, president of the
organization, at 5722 Maryland Ave.
The songs may range from the typical
college type to the University loyalty
variety. The words must be original
although they may be adapted to well
known music. However, new music
accompaniment will probably meet
with greater consideration, according
to Miss Fish. Songs for part singing
are especially desired. The names and
addresses of the contributors must be
written on the reverse side of the
song sheet in order that there may be
no possibility of partiality, in the de-
cisions. The judges have not been de-
cided upon as yet but will be an-
nounced later. To the winner of the
contest will be awarded a five dollar
gold piece. It is hoped that one will
be written worthy to take its place
among the other University songs, ac-
cording to Miss Fish. |

Dr. Edwin Oakes Jordan, chairman
of the department of Hygiene and Bac-
teriology and Director of the Howard
Taylor Ricketts laboratory at the Uni-
versity, will discuss the yielding of
typhoid to science in a lecture next
Monday evening held in Orchestra
hall. This lecture is one of a series
of illustrated talks presented by the
University to the citizens of Chicago.

Prof. Jordan is widely known as a
health authority throughout the United
States and has often been con-
sulted as an expert in health problems
ill Chicago. He has been president of

FIELD IS VICTIM OF
COURSE NUMBERING;

REPEATS SUBJECT

Tom Field, Advertising Copy
manager of The Daily Maroon has
just discovered that he is a victim
of the systematized plan of number-
ing courses which was introduced
this year by Dean Wilkins. He has
just realized that he took a course
in Modern European History twice.

In 1924 Field registered for His-
tory 3. In 1925, beguiled by the at-
tractive new number that adorned
his old course, he registered, en-
tirely unwittingly, according to him-
self, for it again. Not until the final
examination came around did he
discover that it was not the first
time he had attempted to obtain
credit for the course.

Last year the course was known
as History 3 and ostensibly treated
Europe as it existed between 1800
and 1900. The new course, how-
ever, was very confusingly labelled
twentieth century history. Tom
says that the more he studies the
period the more he likes it and is
even considering specializing in that
particular field.

CHOIR WILL GO

ON AIR TONIGHT

Present Enlarged Radio Pro-
gram This Week

Literature, music, science, history,
and social theory will contribute to a
radio program this week representing
every phase of university activities.
The University is broadcasting on its
new and greatly augmented schedule.
The majority of the programs will be
put on the air by The Daily News
station, WMAQ.

Tonight the University choir, under
the direction of Mr. Mack Evans, will
sing carols appropriate to Twelfth
Night.

Prof. Percy Homines Boynton, critic
and essayist, is scheduled for a lecture
on “Two Popular American Fallacies”
tomorrow evening. This will be the
first of a weekly series under the di-
rection of Mr. Boynton, in which the
University will for the first time make
an effort to bring together the research
work of scholars in every field of
American life. Prof. Boynton will dis-
cuss the myth of American isolation
from the rest of the world and the
parallel fallacy of a peculiarly fortun-
ate destiny set aside for the United
States.

The lighter side of campus life will
be represented after the Thursday lec-
ture by a group of students from the
University Y. M. C. A. Athletics, col-
lege songs, and a brief talk on what
college life really means from the
viewpoint of the undergraduate will
make up the program.

lOn Friday Prof. Fay-Cooper Cole,
noted anthropologist, who was one of
the chief scientific witnesses at the
Scopes evolution trial, will begin an-
other series of weekly lectures with an
explanation of the life of “Primitive
Man.”

More than half of the graduate
women students at the University are
under thirty-five and only eleven per
cent of them are married, an analysis
of the student body at the University
shows. Approximately one-fifth of
the graduate women are under
twenty- five years of age, a fourth
of them are between twenty-five and
thirty, another fifth between thirty
and thirty-five, leaving thirty per
cent over thirty-five.

Additional data compiled in the
graduate office show that thirty per
cent of the graduate men are mar-
ried. In a few cases both husband
and wire are registered in one or
another of the graduate schools. At
the time the survey was made it was
pointed out by University authorities
that in view of the zpal with which
married graduate students pursue
their work, even though they are
handicapped by inadequate finances,
there is a real need of housing ac-
commodations for them.

“The married students frequently
live with their children in ‘light
housekeeping’ rooms that are very
ill-adapted to provide conditions un-
der which intellectual work can be
carried on. It is recommended there-
fore that the University recognize the
needs of this group by providing sim-
ply furnished flats in the University-
flat buildings adjacent to the campus
for married graduate students and
that the needs of such students be
considered in the future housing pro-
gram of the University.’’

It was revealed further that fifty-
two per cent of the undergraduate
women and twenty-five per cent of
the graduate women live in their own
homes. Statistics collected two years
ago showed that twenty-five per cent
of the undergraduate men lived in
fraternity houses and four per cent
of the graduate men.

Bob Fisher Wins
Big Daily Maroon
AdvertisingA wa rd
-1----------------

Robert Fisher, a freshman, was
awarded the cup given by the Martin
to the winner of the advei Lisins con-
test conducted during the fall quarter.
The cup was presented at the annual
Maroon banquet which was held on
Dec. 17.

Robert Klein was second in the con-
test and Myron Fulrath third. Fisher
will hold the cup until the next award,
which will be made at the end of the
current quarter.

The new contest, which will be con-
ducted this quarter, will be more
heated, according to Milton Kreines,
advertising manager of the Maroon,
as many new competitors are expected.
Those who are considering entering
the contest, are asked to report to
Kreines in the Maroon office, Ellis hall,
some afternoon this week.

Dr. Jordan to Tell Public How

Science Conquers Typhoid Fever

thor of an authoritative text on “Gen-
eral Bacteriology,” and of a volume
on “Food Poisoning.”

Typhoid fever has been reduced to
the extent that it no longer claims
thousands of victims each year. The
reducing of the typhoid death rate in
Chicago from nearly sixteen in 100,-
000 persons in 1910 to less than two for
the same number in 1924 has been aid-
ed by the chlorination of the city’s
drinking water. A public milk supply
from tuberculosis-free cattle will insure
the elimination of practically all tuber-
culosis of the bones and joints among
Chicago children. The death rate from
diphtheria has been lowered material-
ly, and the disease is expected to be
greatly reduced in the near future by
rendering all children immune.

BREASTED WILL
ENTER ON NEW

FIELD IN EGYPT

“Further Back Than Tut” Is
Watchword of New

Research

For countless millions of years
there have rested the untroubled
bones of a man whose story is un-
known, and the dust of what were
. once his achievements. Prof. James
Henry Breasted has set out on a new
line of archeological endeavor—to
fathom the inscrutable records that
lie hidden under the ground of the
Nile valley.

When the general educational
board’s appropriation of $200,000 for
the continuation of Dr. Breasted’s
research was announced, a mildly in-
terested world exclaimed, “What a
charming person this King Tut must
have been, that so much money
should be spent on him!”—and let it
go at that. But the man who fur-
nished the world of fashion with
something new in the way of patterns
has long since been restored to his
figurative tomb, and the men who
plunge into the limitless past have
gone on.

Will Vi.it Nile

The new field of endeavor has tak-
en the University’s noted Egyptolog-
ist into the Valley of the Nile, where
he will determine the chronological
sequence of prehistoric occupation in
that part of the world, and link up
the Nile Valley with prehistoric
, Europe and the preceding geological
ages.

Outlining possibilities of such an
expedition and pointing out that no
systematic survey of the Nile River
terraces and caverns bearing traces
of ancient man has ever been made,
Prof. Breasted said: *

“An examination of our projected
plans and work for the last six years
will, I hope, make it clear that the
desired support of the Oriental In-
stitute offers a unique opportunity
for the first effective occupation of a
new area of investigation, from which
we are assembling for the first time
all the recovered facts regarding
human origins, and out of which is
growing a new conception of man,
based upon this newly available
knowledge of the hitherto lost chap-
ter of the human career.”

Tells Start of Venture

Inspiration for the new archeaolog-
ical venture came about a year ago
when Prof. Breasted discovered a
mass of rubbish in a cavern, whose
location he describes as “about a
day’s journey above Luxor.”

ALBERT MANSBRIDGE
WILL GIVE TALK IN
CHICAGO SATURDAY

“Adult Education and the Union
of the English-speaking People” is
the subject of a talk to be given by
Mr. Albert Mansbridge, Honorary
Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,

for Adult Education, and a prominent
Lowell Foundation lecturer at Bos-
ton. The talk will feature a lunch-
eon of the English-Speaking Union
at the Palmer House, on Saturday,
Jan. 9.

Mr. Mansbridge is the leading
world authority on the older English
Universities, Oxford and Cambridge.
He is the founder of the Workers’
Educational movement, which is now
one of the major educational forces
of Great Britain and is a very pro-
minent author, especially on educa-
tional subjects, as well as being a
most distinguished speaker. At pre-
sent he is on a speaking tour in this
country.

The luncheon, which will be given
at 12:30, has been arranged in honor
of Mr. Mansbridge. Reservations
at $1.50 a plate may be made at the

university officials, “our friends have
been more generous to us during the
last twelve months than in any previ-
ous calendar year.”

The development campaign has
brought a response from the alumni
putting that body within less than
$200,000 of the quota of $2,000,000 as-
alone have contributed about $190,000.
The campaign is to go forward in 1926
with the encouragement of the large
advisory committee of citizens, recent-
ly formed.

Retire M?ny Professors

The student boil ' has increased in
what is described as ? normal degree.
More than 100 new members have been
added to the faculty, whicn during the
same year has lost by retir -ment more
than a dozen men who had reached
the retiring age of sixty-five Notable
among the new members who had re-
ceived appointment is .Professor Wil-
liam A. Craigie, who nas begun his
work of assembling a monumental dic-
tionary of American English. Among
others are Professor Archer Taylor.
Prof. W. W. Chartere, Prof. EdwaAl
Sapir, and Prof. B. L. Ullman. .

An educational innovation put into
effect with the autumn quarter of thi>
year was the formation of a Woman's
Council, whose membership is made
up of women having charge of the
interests and welfare of the women stu-
dents. Organization of this Council,
which deals with problems such as in
most universities come to the attention
of the dean, or deans, of women, is
described as having reached a stage

where successful operation
fidently be predicted.

University College Adds

University college, the

downtown

department of the University, has not
only had an increase in attendance, but
has launched various new instruction
and research projects of value to per-
sons desiring to study in hours not de-
voted to their occupations. The School
of Commerce and Administration has
made air advance in enterprises under-
taken in cooperation with the com-
munity, such as the Institute of Meat
Packing and a study of problems in
shipping perishable commodities. The]
Home Study department, furnishing
instruction by correspondence, has in-
creased largely in registration and in
the scope of the courses offered.

Among research projects completed
or undrtaken one of the most import-
ant was the experiment concerning the
“ether drift,” or the effect of the rota-
tion of the earth upon the velocity of
light. Results of this experiment, an-
nounced by Prof. A. A. Michelson'
early in the year, were considered to ]

furnish a new’ confirmation of the rela-
tivity theory of Prof. Albert Einstein.

E would like to be the conductor of an orchestra. To stand
with our back to our audience, to command a regiment of

of flutes, cornets, cellos, harps, and oboes (whatever oboes are),
to make every man keep step, aim straight, and fire at just the
right time,—is one of our private ambitions.

We would ignore our listeners, of course. No time for grand-
stand play there. Our whole mind would be on our job. Not a
move, not a sound—not so much as a single squeak—no. not even
one little obligato—would escape us.

“More harmony, Joe,” we would shout. “Rosin up a bit, Phil.” |
“Careful, Jake.” (We would point a warning baton.) “Now Bill,
the snares. That’s it.”

Thus we would build up, bit by bit, element by element, an
opus. Then, with every detail in place, every man doing his share
of the job, we would raise both hands in a gesture of benediction.
“Now, keep together boys,” we would shout. “Hold it and keep
together.” We would synchronize the parts with a great soothing,
graceful sweep of our baton.

Our audience, of course, would not hear these directions. The
music would drown them out. But what would we care for our
audience? Let them hear us or not, as they please. Our concern
would be for our job, for the command of our regiment.

The concert would end; we would turn and bow. Our friends
would whisper in awe. “A great man, this chap Hoganboom,” they
would say. “Truly a master mind.”

YEARBOOKS UP TO THE MINUTE

THE University annual is the link which connects the alumnus
with his undergraduate days. It is the only general record
of his classmates and activities. The only reminder of the ascend-
ancy from the freshman year to the senior. With the expansion
of the University it becomes necessary to expand the volume, not
only in size but in quality. The Cap and Gown has hesitated, in
recent years, to follow the edict.

The growth of the yearbook has not been consistent with the
growth of the University and campus activities. A notable im-
provement was made last year when several supplementary sec-
tions were added; but they are inadequate.

A college or university is judged by such by-products as this.
Is our annual indicative of our size and strength? The outsider
-who picks up the book is not impressed by the cover; upon glanc-
ing through the book he sees pictures of fraternities and clubs,
organizations and societies, but little that intimately illustrates
the campus life, which plays such an important part in college
education.

The editors of the Cap and Gown have an unlimited field in
which to work. They ought to begin at once I

ANNOUNCE INTRA-MURAL CAGE LEAGUES

S. Benson Is New Maroon Athletic Trainer

FIFTY-FOUR TEAMS DIVIDED INTO

CAGEMEN DRILL
FOR INVASION BY

HAWKEYE SQUAD

Defense Good But Maroons
Must Find Basket to
Win Games

With the first Big Ten game but
three days off. Nels Norgren is giving
his cagemen plenty of practice in or-
der to spur on the team for the in-
vasion of the powerful Hawkeye bas-
kctecrs, Scrimmage was the menu
dished out to the .squad whose ranks
are gradually being depleted.

Norgren was not entirely pleased
with the showing the Maroons made
against Drake, and is polishing off the
rough edges in passing and shooting.
Great stress is being laid on blocking
and the short pass. Zimmerman and
Alyea both work the short pass well
and manage to work the ball down the
floor. The other members are not
quite so clever at manipulating the ball
and are endeavoring to improve their
floor work.

Defense Strong

The Maroon defense is strong this
year and should manage to give the
strong Iowa five a stiff battle if the
Chicago sharpshooters can find the
basket. Sam Barry has a smooth run-
ning team that relies on the short pass
and pivot to bring the ball within the
range of the hoop. In Hogan and Mc-
Connell, the Iowa mentor has two
brilliant guards who have an eye for
the basket. Hogan was considered the
most sensational long shot at the Na-
tional Interscholastic three years ago.
Van Deusen and Harrison, two former
all-state forwards, arc expert floor men
and accurate shots. Raffensberger, the
football guard, performs at the tip off
post.

Iowa Has Edge

Although Iowa is conceded to have
a decided advantage, the Maroons may
find themselves and knock Barry s
quintet from their title aspirations.

The Chicago eagers are rapidly
rounding into form and may hit their
stride against the confident visitors.
Two years ago when Chicago tied
for the Big Ten title, the Hawkeves
upset the Maroons and robbed them of
the undisputed leadership of the Con-
ference. The Maroons are set on eve-
ning matters and at the same time in-
tend to be among the leaders them-
selves.

Maroon Splashes

The Maroon swimmers have evid-
ently gained a position of prominence
in the newspaper lime-light during
the past few weeks. Rittenhouse,
Fellinger, Wilder and Captain Ed.
Noyes have all had their share of
photograph publicity. The public
saw Ed. Fellinger’s beautiful mid air
pose in the Tribune, but we wonder
whether he hurt himself when he hit
the water; but then they probably
use a sea gull for the birdie in those
pictures.

Marrie Shore, former Chicago na-
tator, has stopped at the “old swim-
ming hole” while on the way to his
recent Alma Mater, the University of
Michigan. The Wolverine swim crew
is depending on Morrie to net theqi
a few winning points, he being class-
ed one of the fastest breastrokers of
the season, until he meets Mygdai
who has a good chance to take him
down a few notches.

Will Announce Point
Winners For Autumn

Fraternity sporting circles arc in
a flurry of expectancy today, for to-
morrow the I-M office announces
the participation points awarded
during the fall competitions. The
fraternity with the highest total will
be proclaimed to be the autumn
champs and if the total is high
enough will have a hot start towards
the winners laurels for the year.

The rivalry during the past ses-
sion was exceedingly keen so a
goodly num‘her are in the running.
The Kappa Sigs however appear to
be several jumps ahead of the rest
of the field, but their lead is far
from secure. The tabulations are be-
ing rushed to completion tonight
and tomorrow the results will be
published in The Maroon.

BEDTIME YARN

The football season was over, and
only the winter wind rushed through
the leafless trees of the Green Forest,

which only a short while before had
reverberated with “Nine rahs” and the
“Varsity Song," wafted up from down
yonder where was the Green Stadium.
Only in the crossroad's grocery store
maintained by Durkin and Fox was the
season still on, and it was possible that
the cracker-barrel experts there would
not get the final game played until
Green Meadows University started off
its next year’s schedule.

The experts were at it on this par-
ticular evening, as usual, “Yessir,” said
Durkin the Fox, “that’s what I heard.”
“But,” said Barkis the Beaver, “it can’t
be so. No sir, it can’( be so.” he re-
peated plaintively. “Didnt he bawd
Grange out something awful when Red
went and joined the Bears, and didn't
he say the pros was a bunch of bad
eggs, and didn’t he . . . ” Barkis the
Beaver was in poor shape and stopped
wheezing, for breath, regretfully eying
his paunch.

“But I tell you that’s what I heard,”
replied Durkin the Fox. “A lot of
fellows on the inside say so. Yessir,
they say that Zuppke owns the Chi-
cago Bears. Of course, I don’t know
whether to believe it or not, but that’s
what a lot of fellows say,” he re-
peated dogmatically. “Aw," rejoined
Barkis the Beaver, “it can’t be so.”

“And why,” put in Osw’ald the
Owl, “can’t it?” With that, he shut
the one eye be had opened to say it,
and tocked bis head with the air of
an owl W’ho had propounded a poser.
‘Well,” said Barkis the Beaver, taking
a long breath and talking very, very
rapidly, “didn’t be bawl Red out some-
thing awful when he joined the Bears.

HAS SEVENTEEN
YEARS EXPERIENCE

IN SIMILAR WORK

Is a Graduate of Chicago and
Is Taking Two Courses
Now

Succeeding the late Johnny John-
son, veteran trainer for scores of U.
of C. athletic teams during the past
years, is Mr. Simon Benson, Ph. B.,
A. B., B. S., a very capable man for
this responsible position. Mr. Benson
not only knows surgery and medicine,
due to constant study and practice
along these lines, but he is unfortun-
ately very well acquainted with the
athletic sidejrf his new job, due to
several coaching contracts which he
has fulfilled for various nearby high
schools and colleges. Added to this
is the valuable fact that he is a grad-
uate of the University of Chicago,
which further qualifies him for his
present profession and helps to make
him an ideal man for the position.

Served a Long Time

Since 1009, when he served as medi-
cal-gymnast and surgeon for the Cen-

tral Y. M. C. A. of Chicago, he has
been actively engaged in work similar
tp his present profession. In 1911 he
went to Milwaukee, where he con-
tinued his Y. M. C. A. work, until of-
fered a similar position in the Sacred
Heart Natorium of that city, where he

Trackmen Work For
Coming Indiana Meet

Coach Tom Eek’s board runners and
performers began a serious grind on
Monday for their coming meet with
Indiana in Bartlett gymnasium, Jan-
uary 29. Reports have it that the
Hoosiers are blessed with some stellar
trackmen this season, as their lineup
is composed of veterans.

Although Chicago is unusually
strong, in some respects the team is
unbalanced. Coach Eck announced
that in all probability the meet would
be decided by superiority in one or
two deciding events. Due to the short
training period he is stressing condition
more than actual performance. The
men were broken in during the last of
the autumn quarter when several prac-
tice sessions were conducted.

Captain Jim Cusack is expected to
place in his favorite events, the mile
and half-mile. He will be assisted by
Owens, captain of the cross-country
team, in the mile run. Kernwein. Wed-
del and McKinley are in the dashes.

I-M Wrestlers Will
Grapple For Honors

Men who enjoy wrestling but are
not out for varsity or freshman
squads will have a chance to show
their wares in the intramural wrest-
ling tourney to begin soon. The
prelims will come off on the after-
noon of Wednesday. Jan. 20 at 3:30,
and the finals two days later, on
Friday afternoon, at 3:30 also.

There will be seven counts for
which the winners will be given
gold, silver and bronze medals for
first, second and third places re-
spectively. The meet will be run
off under the management of
George Graham, captain of the var-
sity wrestlers, Coach Vorres, and
Idalou Farwell, Intramural manager.
These three will see that all entries
are given fair treatment.

WOMEN’S SPORTS

SEASON IS BEGUN

As the winter sport season opeps,
basketball and swimming will hold the
center of interest in women’s athletics.

Pep and enthusiasm have so far been
displayed by the fact that large num-
bers of women have come out for
swimming, and even more are expected
to show’ interest in basketball, a sport
which was popular last year.

Swimming aspirants for the Junior
College squad should come to the Ida
Noyes pool at 3:30 on Mondays and
Wednesdays, Senior College at 3:30 on
Tuesdays and Thursdays. All women
who know the principles of swimming
are urged by Mrs. Curtis to try out.
Interclass contests will be held accord-
ing to the athletic schedule which will
be announced later.

Gordon Wallace Is Appointed as Manager of Basketball This
Quarter; A Silver Basketball Goes to the
University Champions

Intraumural basketball will start
with a bang Thursday night when the
first of the interfraterity games of the
quarter will be played. Between 80
and 100 teams will be in the compe-
tition this year and the prospects look
good for some stellar aggregations.
The games will begin at 7:15 and all
games will be over by ten. Playoffs
of the postponed games will be held
at 10:15.

Several of the quints have been
worked out, and although it is a little
early to predict anything, there are a
few’ that show unusual possibilities.
The Phi Psi’s, Psi U’s, Sig Chi’s, and
Delta Sigs look like the best at the
present w-riting.

Wallace New Manager

George Wicmer, head of the intra-
mural department, announced yester-
day that Gorden Wallace had been ap-
pointed as manager of basketball to

succeed Karl Zander who failed to re-
turn to school for the winter quarter

The awards and prizes this year will
be bigger and better than ever before.
In class A a silver loving cup will be
given to the winner of each league.
In the non-fraternity 1 eague eight
medals will be given the members ol
the winning team and the same w'ill
be done in the graduate league. A
beautiful silver basketball mounted
upon a mahogany pedestal w’ill be
presented to the team which wins the
university championship, while the first
eight members of the team will re-
ceive gold medals. The runner ups
will receive bronze basketballs and

medals.

The effort was too much for a beaver

go no further for a moment.

“That Britton what?” demanded
Durkin the Fox. "Pull ydrself together
and tell us.” “Ur . . . cof . . . ”,
wheezed Barkis, and then, making a
superhuman attempt, he breathed,
“that Britton poked him ... on the . .
nose.” Then he slid to the floor, a
limp heap. “I do not believe it.” said
Oswald the Owl. opening both eyes.
Barkis looked up from the floor with a
glassy eye. “Neither,” he said, "do 1
but that’s what they say.’

A wild eyed Pol. Econ. student burst
into the office with this scheme to re-
form Chicago: “The trouble with the
inhabitants.” say; he, “is that they’ve
got to be al! the time rushing from one
end of the city to the other. Now why
not apply scientific principles to the
situation? Analyzing it all out we find
ourselves hanging to the straps with
a trainload of people going one way
while another string of cars whizzes by
hauling just as many in the other di-
rection. This is bad economics. We
must find the solution in the clearing
house method. Just count all the peo-
ple who want to go north—suppose
there are three thousand, then count
all the people who want to go south—
for instance, about tweny-nine hun-
dred. And instead of all this commo-
tion and fuss just let everyone stay
where they are except one hundred
who would be sent south to square the
balance.

“Then,” concludes this genius, “they
could tear up all the L tracks and put
the I. C. engineers to work scrubbing
the Art Institute.”

Ten or twelve hours a day toils the coolie. If he
carries all he can, he moves one ton one mile in
one day. For that he receives twenty cents.

Cheap labor! Yet compared with our American
worker, receiving at least twenty-five times as much
for an eight-hour day, the coolie is expensive labor.
In America we move one ton one mile for less than
one cent. The coolie, working by hand, accomplishes
little; while the American, with electricity’s aid,
accomplishes much.

Plenty of electricity and cheap electricity —these
are two great advantages which America enjoys
over the rest of the world. While our present gener-
ating capacity is 20,600,000 kilowatts, new develop
ments call for 3,000,000 kilowatts more per year.

To college men and women— potential leaders—will
fall the duty of finding more and still more work
for electricity, with less and still less toil for our
workers. For the task is but begun!
