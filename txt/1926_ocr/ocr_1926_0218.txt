LITERARY NEWS
SECTION MAR. 3

Eight Page Magazine Will
Supplement Daily Issue

Every Two Weeks

The Daily Maroon will supplement
its regular four-page edition with an
eight page literary magazine, Wed-
nesday, ' March 3. The literary sup-
plement will become a regular feature
of the daily paper in future.

The first and only edition during
the Winter quarter wii! be a “Local”
number drawing its contributions
from the many famous men and
women of the faculty. It will contain
a comprehensive section for the thea-
tre as well as one for books. Poetry
will also have a page. Interviews with
prominent theatrical stars and news-
paper editors will be a part of the
magazine, as well as the many fea-
tures. It will be published every other
week throughout the Spring quarter.

Walter G. Williamson, one of the
news-editors of The Daily Maroon
will be the editor of the first number.
He worked on the idea throughout the
Winter quarter, but was unable to
execute his plan owing to the deple-
tion of the Maroon staff.

“It is my plan,” said Williamson,
“to fake charge of the first number to
see that nothing goes wrong. After
the first edition is off the press it will
take care of itself. I intend, with the
aid of the editors, to select an editor,
and business manager who can devote
all of their time to this project. They
will have their own staff and will be
independent of the daily publication.
The editorship will be on a competi-
tive basis as will the other staff posi-
tions." The selected staff will start
work on the bi-monthly publication
at the beginning of the Spring quar-
ter.

This new section will appear on
Wednesday of every other week. Af-
ter the first few issues, the space will
be devoted to contributions of stu-
dents and faculty members. Special
effort will be made to have articles
written by prominent members of the
student body. Clever essays, used in
class work, may also be featured. In-
terviews with leading faculty members
will give much additional material for
this section.

Royal Purple of
Roman Collegian

Really Maroon

By Mary Winner Hughes

Royal purple isn't royal purple at
all, but maroon, and the Roman' col-
legian was as particular to choose the
color to match his complexion as is
the collegian of 1926. This informa-
tion is revealed by Miss Lillian Wil-
son, formerly a student at the Uni-
versity who has recently written a
book on the Roman Toga.

Following Miss Wilson's finds, the
students of Dean Gordon Laing’s class
on Roman private life are realistically
carrying forward her ideas by dress-
ing a set of wooden dolls a la Roman
fashion.

A Roman, Miss Wilson discovered,
is not as old as he feels, but as ancient
as the type of toga he wears. And so
Catullus, who flourished during the
Imperial period, finds his wooden fig-
ure draped with a dark brown toga,
while the form of his son, Rufus, is
covered with a white one, with a wide
royal purple—no, maroon—band, un-
til he has reachefl the age.of seventeen
years.

One may converse with these visi-
tors of Dean Laing’s, at his office,
where they have graciously permitted
themselves to be displayed as depic-
tors of Roman fashion.

ADDAMS STATES
HOPE OF PEACE

Says Governments Begin To
Distrust War

“Governments of the world are
learning to distrust war as a method
of procedure,” stated Jane Addams, of
Hull House fame, in a talk to mem-
bers of the Liberal Club last night.
War is being challenged not only on a
moral and ethical basis but from the
viewpoint of efficiency.

“If there is going to be world peace,
it will come through the governments;
it will either come through the League
or through consciousness of necessity
of uniting.” said Miss Addams.

As a means of international peace,
she outlined and explained four well-
known methods. These were the
Hague Tribunal, the Interparliament-
ary Assembly, the World Court, .and
the League of Nations.

In discussing her widely diversified
travels, Miss Addams said that the
people of India are being trained to
rule themselves, although they are pre-
occupied with religion. The same con-
dition exists in China, but it
seems each governor of the thirty-two
provinces is trying to get control of
the government here.

What's On Today

meet today at 4:30 in Harper M-15.

PHOENIX-CIRCLE ‘‘Wet” Prom Not

MAKES BOW TO
CAMPUS TODAY

Prize Cover for First
Issue of Dual

Magazine

The Prom Number of The Phoenix,
the big issue of the year and the first
to be published since this magazine's
merger with The Circle, will be on
sale on campus today.

Probably the most striking feature
will be the cover drawing. It is done
by Fred Handschy, editor, and is the
first he has ever done in his four
years’ connection with The Phoenix.
Although, at Handschy’s request, no
signature or title appears under the
drawing, it is styled by him: “The
Lady and the Troubedour,” and is a
charcoal and wash sketch. It was done
while Handschy was attending the
Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and
won a prize in a nation-wide art con-
test.

Continue Co-ed Letters

One of the features of the issue will
be the fifth installment of “Letters
from a Co-ed.” According to opinion
of those who have seen it. it is the
best of the series. Because of the
supposed change in tone of the maga-
zine, there was some hesitation as to
whether or not this installment should
be run.

“Extra-Curricular Characters,” a
two-page spread drawn by Irma Selz
is another high-light of this number.
The sketches which accompany the
drawings are done by Allen Heald.

Contains Parody

One of the sure fire bits of parody
in the issue is by Jo Waters and will
be entitled, “The Private Life of Ju-
liet Capulet.”

Chimes to Ring
Out Old Folk

Songs At Ten

Bohemian, Dutch, Old English,
Scotch, German, and Scandinavian
folk-songs are included in the list of

new music especially selected for the I
University chimes by Mack Evans,
University choir director. Music
from this new list will be broadcast ।
from the Mitchell Tower station ev-
ery night from Tuesday to Friday,
inclusive.

An old Dutch melody “Revelie,”
and an Irish sea song are the most
interesting pieces of music in this
group, acording to Evans. The music
has been selected for its technical ex-
cellence as well as its tunefulness,
and has been arranged for the limit-
ed range of the bells in many cases.

Recent technical experiments have
improved the broadcasting quality
of the bells, according to Paul Kel-
ler, University chimer. Because the
chimes have a range of only ten
notes, it is extremely hard to find
good music which can be played on
them.

“Because of the limited range of
our set of chimes,” said Keller, “I
think it would be fine if a graduating
class would make the University a
present of a bell or two. In this
way we might build up a splendid set
within a few years.”

Prof. Robert E. Park, head of the
department of Sociology, will speak
on “Negro Race Consciousness”
from Mitchell Tower tonight at 9:00.

Dr. Rodney L. Mott of the depart-
ment of Political Science will speak
on “Law and Administration” to-
morrow night from the same station.

LEE RESTS EASILY;

HAS SLIGHT FEVER

Deemer Lee, news editor on The
Daily Maroon, who is confined in Du-
rand hospital with an attack of scar-
let fever, is reported to be in a good
general condition. He has a slight
fever, but is able to sleep well.

Probable; Letter
Unnecessary

______

Terming the action as unneces-
sary, students and advisors of the
University expressed their surprise
at the open letter circulated among
fraternities, with a request that they
refrain from drinking at the Wash-
ington Prom.

Gerald Karr Smith, executive sec-
retary of the Y. M. C. A., holds the
opinion that the University is of a
very high moral tone, which makes
a request of that kind superfluous.
“It is unfortunate,” he said, “that
such a warning has gone out, and
even more, that it has been confineu
to the fraternity men of the Univer-
sity. The w’omen as well as the men
should have received tht same letter.
This is not an implication that they
drink, but merely a suggestion that
they should be appealed to in order
to exert their influence in upholding
the general moral standards of the
annual prom. I contend that the re-
quest and warning should have been
general, not directed toward parti-
cular groups.”

It should be taken for granted
that there is no drinking is the opin-
ion of John Meyer, co-editor of the
Cap and Gown. “I have seen no ex-
amples of it,” he said.

“I do not see the need for such a
letter,” said Gifford Hitz, co-editor
of the Cap and Gown, “for I have
understood that there is no drinking
at such functions.”

Stewart Lytle, head of the inter-
scho astic meet for the coming year
considered the letter very good. But
he added that, “As for drinking, ft
has not been known to me.”

Dean Chauncey S. Boucher, ex-

pressed his approval of the letter as
a reminder. “It is to be regarded as
a pre-cautionary measure to prevent
any possible blot of the reputation
of the Prom,” he said.

The standards of former Univer-
sity social functions have apparently
persisted in the memories of those
who attended them, thus making the
letter of warning seem useless.

HEAR SPEECHES FOR

LEADERS AGREE ON EVE
OF PROM THAT GEORGE

Everything Ready For Greatest Prom In
Thirty-Two Years; Leaders
Review History

PROM BULLETIN

Alice Boulden and Dorothy
Rae, of the “Gay Paree” company
will be guests at the Washington
Prom tomorrow night at the South
Shore Country club. They accept-
ed an invitation last night after

• their performance at the Apollo
theatre. Who their escorts will
be could not be learned last night.

Miss Boulden and Miss Rae are
the principals in a “two man”
team which puts over a number
of song hits nightly at the Apollo
theatre. They will probably give
several of their specialties at the
Prom. What they are especially
noted for, they admit, is their ren-
dition of a song called, “Every
Little Girlie Has To Have a Lit-
tle Bull.”

. . With Patricia Ann Manners, this
makes three stars of loop theatres
who will attend the Prom.

LET IMPORTER

IN SAYS BOARD

Board of Undergraduate Pub-
lications Issues Statement

Representation of The Daily Ma-
roon at meetings of the Undergradu-
ate council by a Senior staff member
was recommended by the Board of
Undergraduate Publications at a
meeting held yesterday afternoon in
Cobb hall.

The Board statement follows:

“While the Board of Undergraduate
Publications has no opinion to ex-
press as to the question of open meet-
ings it recommends that The Daily
Maroon be represented at the meet-
ings of the Undergraduate council by
an accredited member of its Senior
staff,—recognizing of course that clos-
ed executive sessions may be neces-
sary for the discussion of personalities
and that at such sessions the Maroon
reporter would retire.”

“Both the Maroon and the Council
have good points to offer,” said Ad-
dison Wilson, chairman of the Board.
“I think that the Council meetings
ought to be open to a Maroon report-
er unless they are executive sessions
at which personalities are being dis-
cussed.”

MEMBERS OF SENIOR
CLASS TO ASSEMBLE

AT LUNCHEON TODAY

Of the one hundred tickets which
have been alloted for the Senior class

luncheon, to be held today at 12 in the

sun parlor of Ida Noyes hall, only a
few remain, according to committee
chairmen. If any tickets are obtain-
able they may be secured from the
following women an campus: Eleanor
Rice, Beryl Berringer, Eleanor Fish,
Margaret Roberts and Natalie
Combes.

No chapel services will be held to-
day, in order to enable students to at-
tend the luncheon. The latter will be
a purely social affair, and Jeanette
Hayward and Earle W. English, who
have charge of the luncheon, promise
several very novel features for the en-
tertainment. Mr. Frank H. O’Hara,
director of student activities, and Mrs.
Robert Valentine Merrill, director of
Social Activities, have been asked as
chaperons. The luncheon will be over
early enough to permit those students
who attend to reach their 1:30 classes.

By Al E. Widdifield

“The Prom-leaders are ready for
the thirty-second time in the history
of the University to celebrate the
birthday of the cherry tree amputa-
tor,” said Graham Kernmein, one of
the leaders of the promenade, last
night.

The words of Graham Kernwein
recalled the occasion of the first an-
nual “Washington Ball” given thirty-
two years ago—in 1894—under the
endorsement of President William
Rainey Harper, at the Hotel Barry.
A four-piece orchestra—piano, flute,
violin, and accordion, furnished the
music for the waltzes and quadrilles.

Tells of Prom’s Past

Down through the thirty-two
years, Kernwein pointed out, a series
of changes have taken place. Leaders
have given the Prom in many differ-
ent places. In 1897 it was the Chi-
cago Beach hotel; in 1902 it was
Bournique’s Dancing academy; in
1922, Ida Noyes hall. 1924 began
the South Shore Country club regime
where the Prom has held sway for
three years.

Tomorrow night continuous music
will furnish a bit of innovation for
the dance. The combined forces of
“Husk” O’Hare and his Casino Club
ensemble, and Ralph Williams with
his Victor Recording orchestra will,
according to Paul Cullom, who has
witnessed three Proms, be the finest
musical arrangement ever made for a
Washington Promenade.

Patricia Manners To Attend

Wtih the acceptance of an invita-
tion to Patricia Manners, who plays
the part of Gretchen of Heidelburg
in the play, “The Student Prince,”
Prom-goers have been given an addi-
tional entertaining feature. This
will be the first time in several years
that a “loop” celebrity has attended
the Prom. Last year Francine Larri-
more, who was reported to be at-
tending the dance' in company with a
University graduate student, failed
to appear due to the furor in the
ranks of the campus women who be-
lieved that they should be invited
to the Prom in preference to theari-
cal stars.

Says Prom Grows Yearly

“It seems as if each year the Prom
plays a larger role in the lives of the
undergraduates,” said Lucy Lamon,
one of the Prom leaders last night.
“Down through the thirty-two years
of its existence one can see it grow
in importance. It is a fitting affair
to climax the social activities of the
winter season.”

Editors of the Prom Maroon wish
to announce that this publication will
be placed under each plate at the
Prom dinner. The paper is now on
the press, and will be ready on the
eve of the Prom.

OFFER FISKE PRIZE
TO CAMPUS POETS

Students of the University who
are interested in the writing of
poetry have been urged to submit
their work in competition for the
John Billings Fiske prize. Since
there are no limitations as to the
length, subject, or form, there is a
wide range for talent which should
encourage young writers.

Contributions should be sent to the
President’s office before March 1st.
They should be type-written, and
signed with a pseudonym. Only one
poem may be submitted by each stu-
dent, and this must be accompanied
by a sealed envelope containing the
name and address of the writer.

Those who have won the prize be-
fore are ineligible.

CLASS SPIRIT

WE hear of school spirit—that spirit of enthusiasm which ranges
throughout the entire school, the alumni, the faculty, as well
as the graduate and undergraduate student bodies; and then we
hear of class spirit—that spirit of enthusiasm which supposedly
ranges throughout each particular class, the senior, the junior, the
sophomore, the freshman. This spirit is of an especial kind; it
touches each member of each class in a particular manner; in a word
it is an individual sort of a spirit.

O'

THE BOARD AGREES

.UR contemporaries are with us. The Board of Student Publica-
tions, meeting for the first time since last October, added its

recommendation to The Daily Maroon’s request for open council
meetings. The Undergraduate council is a legislative body, re-
sponsible to the public that elects it, and so must be open to the in-
spection of that public. Secret meetings may of course be allowed for
personal discussions; but all votes, actions, and decisions must be
open to teh student body. A Maroon representative at the council
is one way of obtaining an open council.

Such a measure will not be a compromise. It will be the opening
of all important council meetings to the public—nothing less. The
restrictions of courtesy must be observed, of course; the public need

not know (nor does it care
much) why Jake Bilgewater isn’t
voting for MacMcQuorkle for the
job of Prom-leader. But if the
council plans to undertake works
of general interest like the
present study of seniors com-
plaints, etc., the public should be
allowed to listen in. The public
cares, and should be encouraged
to care.

Tie For Second

Preventing the redoubtable Sprad-
ling from scoring at all in the opening
half and then stopping him from scor-
ing more than two buckets in the last,
the close guarding Maroon eagers up-
set the Boilermakers last night .21-19.
Babe Alyea, starred for the winners
with three baskets and two free
throws.

This upset, the last so tar of a
year of dope upheavals in the confer-
ence cage mess, puts Purdue in a
quadruple tie for second place with
Michigan, Ohio State and Iowa in the

.500

class. Wisconsin and Illinois

lead the race at present with four

wins

and two losses each, having a

percentage of .666.

Close Guarding

During the first twelve minutes of
play, no Purdue score was made due
to the well executed guarding of the
Maroon clad warriors. In the mean-
time the latter were piling up a sub-
stantial lead. In the last three min-
utes of the half Purdue came back
and almost tied the score, which was
13 to 12, favor the Norgrenites at the
half.

But this scanty lead might not last
long, what with the past results of
the present season staring one in the
face. Any one of six or seven squads
still has a chance to cop the title,
though the Maroons are perhaps out
of it. Yet they may still have a few
upsets under their belts for the others.

Another league winner was crown-
ed in last evening's intramural basket-
ball play, when the Phi Sigma Delta
“B” team downed a fighting Kappa
Sig five to the tune of 15 to 10. This
contest completed an undefeated rec-
ord for,, the Phi Sigs. The score at
half time was 9 to 1, the Kappa Sigs
coming back strong to cut down the
big lead and put a threat into the close
play of the last period.

No Substitutions Made

Fingold, of the winners, and Scher-
ubel, of the losers fought out a scor-
ing duel and led the attack for their
teams. Fingold won individual honors
with nine points. EtheLtein, Donchin,
Shure, and Fried completed the Phi
Sig personnel. Kelly played well for
the Kappa Sigs. Neither team made
a substitution, but both were heavy on
the fouls.

Close guarding kept the score down
in a hard fought Graduate League
game, which the Packers, a husky five
from the C. and A. School, won from
Hitchcock hall by a 11 to 6 score.

Winners Have Weight

It was the advantage in size that
helped the winners to forge ahead in
the second period, after a 6 to 6 stand-
still had been fought out in the first
half. Both teams showed form that
compares favorably with that of the
fraternity league. The Packers have
by far the heaviest outfit in Intra-
mural competition, and promise to
give the fraternity champion a real
game if they play them for the Univer-
sity title.

OF INTRA-MURALS

Takes Place of Wiemer
To Finish Work of
Quarter

In
who

the absence of George Wiemer,
has left school for the present,

the Intra-mural department, under the
leadership of Paul Cullom, elected
John Howe to the post of Winter
.Athletic Manager. This was the most
important piece of business which the
intramural department transacted yes-
terday afternoon at its board meeting.

It also nominated the several com-
mittees which are to run the Winter
Athletic Revue; these will be pub-
lished in tomorrow’s Maroon along
with other news concerning the Re-
vue.

Howe is a junior in the department
and his work in the past makes him
well fitted for the position. Last
Spring he managed the intra-mural
playground ball tournament, which
was featured by the interest and fast
play shown by the contestants. Even
though the play was interrupted by
many days of rain and bad weather, the
tourney was the most successful of
many years. An innovation at that
time was the participation of non-
fraternity teams.

Arrangements are being made and
plans completed for the tenth an-
nual National interscholastic basket-
ball tourney which will be held in
Bartlett Gym during the first week
in April. Henry Sackett member of
the varsity cage team will manage
the big affair this year it was an-
nounced. Invitations will be mailed
nt to all the state champions just
as soon as they are decided and in
some cases the runner ups in tne

of the most successful in years. The
committee hopes to have upwards of
150 entries in the meet this year,
making it one of the largest.

MATMEN TO GRAPPLE
WITH ILLINI TUESDAY;
EXPECT TOUGH MEET

With the big meet of the season
scheduled for Tuesday against the II-
lini, Captain George Graham and his
grapplers are working hard this week
in effort to get themselves into shape.
The team which is composed of six
sophomores and one senior is improv-
ing rapidly and will give the veteran
Illini matmen a real battle. The down-
staters have two real men in ex-Cap-
tain Kinny and Captain Gciss. The lat-
ter is a middleweight and will meet his
ma!'h in Bob Massey who has been
going great of late. Kinny in the 135
pound class will clash with Graham in
a battle of veterans.

In one of the closest meets possible
Wisconsin was defeated Friday night
by a score of 12 to IL With the score
7 to 11 against the Maroons Johnson,
a newly converted heavyweight, threw
his opponent Muegge to terminate a
terrific battle and thus won the match
and the meet. Graham also won his
match by a fall while Massey obtained
the decision over Chada. Davis, one
of the best welterweights is out for
the season having sustained an infect-
ed leg. He will be replaced by Kurtz.

LAMENT

The poets rave of coal-black eyes,
And chant of eyes of blue—

I ... I have eyes of grayish-green,
A poor neglected hue.

These golden heads win endless
praise

Black, auburn hair the same—
But mine is simply medium brown,
And no one seeks my name.

Some poets choose tall heroines
Some call small ones divine—
But I’m a hopeless in-between,
The unsung type in mine.

Oh, damit Turk, nobody around
here loves me but my Sorority sis-
ters—and we haven’t got a chapter
