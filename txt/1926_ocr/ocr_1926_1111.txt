fy&w&Mn^tem APPOINT THIRTEEN TO FROSH BOARD get glimpse of

Food is one of' the primary con-
siderations of life. Thus has it been
always with me:

“So was it when my life began,
So is it now, I am a man:
So let it be when I grow old,

Or let me die!”

But living at a frat house, it is very
problematical whether I shall have
the opportunity of growing old be-
fore dying, for this very element of
food that I am speaking about may
put me under sod ere much more
snow flies. Only last night, after
pushing back my plate of food, un-
disturbed except for a couple of in-
vestigatory gouges, I turned grumhl-
ingly to the house president and let
out one of my customary plaintive
sobs about the food. “The meat,” I
pointed out, “is impossible. The corn
is scorched, the mashed potatoes sog-
gy. What kind of management is
this?” To which he replied imper-
turably, downing his victuals the
while: “Any complaints about the
food must be made to the steward.”
He said it mechanically—he had said
it often before.

*	*	*	*

“If,” continued this autocrat of
the dinner table, anticipating my
coming remarks, “you should ever
feel any hostility towards the lady
who officiates out there”—and he
pointed towards the kitchen—“do t
not express it either to me or to her
directly. If your thoughts are of
such an explosive nature that you
must air them, do so in some harm-
less fashion—say through the medium
of your column in The Maroon.”
With which cutting remark, he turn-
ed away, leaving me to ponder on an
empty stomach on the injustice of
things. Little did the fellow think I
would take him up (Horatio Alger),
hut just see how he’s fooled.

* *	*	*

I do not think that the situation
exists only at the eating club where
I eat, now well, now’ indifferently.
Observation—that is, eating at other
places—forces me to believe that it:
exists at every eating club that eats.
My thoughts, I know, are the thoughts
of plenty more. They are no slam
at the frat, or at the cook. Things
simply are as they are, and always
have been. Of course, some fraterni-
ties are, hapily, not so situated. Their
cooks go on through the years cook-
ing to the satisfaction of the succeed-
ing generations. The other day, for
instance, a chapter letter blew in
from Wisconsin. “Cora,” said one of
the items, “has now been with us
fourteen years.” This, patently,
either indicates that she is a pretty
noble cook, or that the boys are a bit
weak-kneed, and lack the courage to
give her notice.

*	*	*	*

Now (lest our lady read this) I
want to say that the cook has good
‘lays. The Brussels sprouts, potatoes
au gratin, salad, etc., of the other
evening, for example, were excellent.
I am inclined to lay her failings,
when they occur, to the fact that
the materials with which she has to
work are not so good. That’s the
fault of the grocery store, and of no-
body else. I have been considering
the situation for some time. I have
considered it in conjunction with
John Allison, whose experience at
home and abroad (at other houses)
for four years makes him expert on
the point. I feel, and he feels, that
the collegians at large would appre-
ciate good food, simple and well
done—and reasonable. We want,
here and now, to feel out the campus
on an Allison-Morgenstern Food
Shoppye or Pantrye. Well boys,
what’s the sentiment?

GROUP GOVERNS
CLASS OF 1930
UNTIL ELECTIONS

Seven Men and Six Women
Compose Groups; Autrey
Chairman

The last and most vital step in the
organization of the Freshman class
was made yesterday with the appoint-
ment of thirteen members of tiie
class to the Board of Management
by the Undergraduate Council. This
board wil have entire charge of all
freshman activities and relations un-
til the election of class officers in the
winter quarter, when it will automat-
ically dissolve.

Elect Thirteen

The thirteen elected, of which
seven are men and six women, are:
Autrey, chairman; Arthur Abbott;
Dexter Masters, Wanzer Brunnelle,
Leonard Hirsch. Frank Milchrist,
Waler Knudsen, Rosaline Hamm,
Betty Rouse, Gertrude Goddard, Jean
Harvey, Carol Cundy, and Margaret
Newton. The group was selected by
the h^ads of the various campus ac-
tivities as those who seemed to show’
the most interest, ability and person-
ality in their respective departments
of work. ,

According to Wendell Bennett,
chairman of the Undergraduate Stu-
dent Council, this idea is a new
one in the runing of a class.

This will be a precedent for future
incoming freshmen. “Election of
men and women to this group,”
Wendell Bennett said, “is based al-
most entirely on the reports the
heads of activities give regarding
them, and their general attitude and
personality.

N. C. CONWAY, YALE
SENIOR, CHARLOTTE

VANDERLIP ENGAGED l

Charlotte Vanderlip, a former stu-
dent at the University and a mem-
ber of Esoteric has announced her
engagement to Norton C. Conway, a
senior at Yale. Miss Vanderlip’s par-
ents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank A. Vander-
lip are both alumni of the University,
they were members of Delta Kappa
Epsilon and Esoteric respectively.

Mrs. Vanderlip, the former Mabel
Narcissa Cox was a student at the
University from 1899 to 1902. It was
during this time that she met Mr.
Vanderlip a meeting that led to their
marriage.

EIGHT HOUR EXAMS

COMMON IN ITALY

Eight hour exams for college stu-
dents during which eating, smoking,
or sleeping, but no talking or laugh-
ing is permitted will be one of the
subjects discussed by Signore Tam-
borra in his lecture on “Italian Cus-
toms” at a meeting of II Circulo Ital-
iano tomorrow’ at 4 :30 in Ida Noyes
hall. Signore Tamborra, who is a na-
tive of Bari, Italy and a graduate of
the Royal Technical Institute of
Italy, will also emphasize the fact
that Italians, unlike Americans, nev-
er eat on the street.

Mirror Issues Call

All women interested in working
on committees for the production
staff of the Mirror, who have not
signed up, may do so today from 12

Foot-Ball Phoenix

Crashes Through

Campus To-day

The “Block and Tackle” number
of the Phoenix charged down the
campus today.

A penciled portrait of Coach Alon-
zo A. Stagg on a maroon field and
surrounded by gridiron warriors
makes up the cover. It is the work
of Carl Bonan and Gerard Barry.
Bonan sketched the “Oki Man of
the Midway” and the background was
designed by Barry.

A story of Coach Stagg and his
w’ork on the Chicago campus is one
of the features of the November is-
sue. The secret of Capt. Wallie
Marks’ popularity as well as the work-
ings of the team on and off the field
are divulged.

Quarter by quarter the Army-
Navy game is burlesqued. Biblical
Literature 242 makes it debut with
biographies of Jeremiah of Bethel
and Dirty Dalton.

with a program of piano solos at an
open house in the south lounge of
the Reynolds Club today from 4 t) 6.

Mr. Irwin was president of last
year’s glee club, and has made art
extensive study of the piano. The
Y. M. C. A., in an effort to promote
greater sociability among students,
especially new students, is sponsoring
the informal affair. Stewart Kenney,
social chairman ef the “Y”, is in
charge. All men are invited, and re-
freshments will be served.

Swedish Arts and
Antiques Discussed

By Mrs. A. Berg

“Sweden has her antiques and
her arts as well as any other coun-
try,” said Mrs. Anna Peterson
Berg, Swedish author and teacher.
“I have come to America to bring
one of these arts to the Swedish
families here and to all otheis
w’ho may be interested.”

Mrs. Berg has been instructing
American teachers in the old Swe-
dish needle-work. In order to
spread this work and establish an
international art, she has taught
in many American schools. Fol-
lowing her program, she spoke last
night at a meeting of the Scan-
dinavian club in Ida Noyes hall.

COUNCIL ENTERTAINS

Tea for graduate and undergradu-
ate students will be served by Fed-
eration council members and spon-
sors this afternoon from 3:30 to 6
in Ida Noyes hall. Cooperating with
Dean Sophonisba Breckinridge, Fed-
eration is sponsoring this affair to
help create a feeling of good fellow-
ship among the graduate and under-
graduate schools. The tea was such
a success last year that a second one
is being given this year.

FIRST SOVEREIGN

LAW NABS TWO
AT ILLINI GAME

Expend Efforts to Stop Re-
sale of Tickets

Scalping, famed in song and story
as the sport of the first Americans,
has pitched camp in another form
on the very threshold of Stagg field.

The football ticket committee
checking up today on its efforts last
Saturday to prevent the resale of
tickets to the Chicago-Illinois game
announced that disciplinary action is
now being taken by the University of
Illinois against one student arrested
at the gate for trying to resell a tic-
I ket he obtained from the Illinois al-
lotment. Two other tickets, also in
the Illinois assignment, were offered
l for sale at the gate and the agents
1 taken into custody by the Hyde Park
police, the committee further re-
ported.

University To Inflict Penalties

I “Every effort is being made to pre-
1 vent the scalping of tickets fop the
remainder of the Chicago games,”
said Lester F. Blair, chairman of the
football tickets committee. “The Uni-
versity has made it clearly under-
stood that football tickets are sold
to specific individuals and may not be
resold at any price, and any person
breaking this regulation is subject to
as severe a penalty as the University
and the law can inflict.”

The recent apprehension, of
scalpers dealing in tickets for
Army-Navy game has aroused a
public interest in the matter.

educational Psychology* department
will give a preliminary report on the
“Study of Foster Children” at a
.meeting of Phi Delta Kappa tonight
at 7:30 in Blaine hall, room 117.

Professor Freeman’s talk will be
based on his work on foster children,
conducted to discover to what extent
favorable environment will improve
these children. Tabulated informa-
tion of 400 children as compared
with their surroundings, the charact-
er of the home and the age adopted,
will be discussed.

Monday

Today is “swingout” day for the

Seniors and their long-heralded canes.

The cane is a recent addition to
the University senior’s wardrobe and
has taken its place as a result of a

movement set on foot early in
quarter. The new style has the
proval of the Undergraduate and
terfraternity councils.

the

In-

This year is the first time that any
official mark of distinction has been
given the seniors. It is believed by
those who sponsored the movement
that the canes will aid to build up
class spirit.

The canes are for sale at the Uni-
versity book store and may be pur-
chased at any time within the Text
few weeks. They are very plain,
being entirely undecorated and unor-
namented.

No Politics In India

Asserts Sir Whyte

“Lack of political parties, the ba-
sis for popular government in nearly
every nation where democracy has
succeeded, is a serious obstacle to the
present experiment in democracy in
India, Sir Frederick Whyte, first
president of the Legislative Assem-
bly of India asserted in a public lec-
ture at the University yesterday.
This is due partly to the background
of the Indians and partly to the sys-
tem established by England,’ continu-
ed the speaker.

The lecture was the third of a
series of four being delivered at the
University by Sir Frederick Whyte
on the political situation in Asia,
and particularly India.

Marie, queen of Roumania, will
visit the University Monday.

At 3:45 p. m., November 15, 1926.
this small section of the country that
doesn’t recognize royalty will be on
its toes to welcome the first foreign-
, er bearing the title of sovereign to
| visit the campus. European royalty
i in the form of the Crown Prince of
I England and the Crown Prince of
! Sweden—the latter receiving an hon-
ary doctorate—has visited the cam-
pus before, but the only supreme rul-
ers, by hereditary or political right,
entertained in the annals of the Uni-
, versity are the late William McKin-
ley and the late Theodore Roosevelt,
presidents of the United States.

Max Mason Heads Committee

President Max Mason will head the
committee of welcome for Marie’s
visit. Other members will be: F. C.

TODAY is Armistice Day.

This day eight years ago with wild joy we rejoiced in the
cessation of hostilities. We hoped and believed that the last gun
which sent its shrieking charge of death over the devastated western
front would be the last one in history to take its toll of human life.

The war to
face of the
armistice, a
to come.

end wars was over and war had been wiped from the
earth. But now we realize that all it marked was an
temporary ending of armed hotilities. Peace has yet

Today we celebrate an intermission in the carnage. The war
spirit is still with us. In Europe, Asia and America fighting is now
in progress or the seeds of future discord are rapidly germinating.
Today we reverently remember the millions of men who died. In
this country comparatively few families will have their life-long sor-
row made more poignant, but in Europe there is scarcely a family
which has not contributed one or many more than one dear life to
the huge total of the killed.

Today, we, who may be the cannon fodder of the future, can
mourn with them. And we can resolve to prolong the present
armistice so long that war will pass from the earth. We can work
toward international good-will that we may avert the catastrophe of
another world war. Then perhaps our posterity may have instead
of “Armistice Day,” Peace Day.

TWENTY-TWO COMMITTEES

w

E NOTE with amusement an announcement in a recent edition
of the Daily Cardial, University of Wisconsin newspaper. It

seems that the authorities up at Madison have hit upon a master
plan for guiding the wandering steps of the students. They have
appointed twenty-two brand new committees which from now hence-
forward will “regulate all phases of student life.’*

Many of these committees, no doubt, actually will function
and will perform indispensable services. But we suspect that such
committees as those labeled “Student Life and Interests," “Societies,
Fraternities and Politics,” and “Cardinal Advisory” will be pleasant
groups which will meet occasionally, make impressive reports and
do nothing.

The regulation of all phases of student life by neatly classified
committees is a rosy dream. At best it can be only superficial and
negative, because self-respecting students, we have observed, have
a habit of rgulating themselves. In the whole economy of student
life regulations and faculty committees count for little. And rightly
so. University men and women should and do and will regulate
themselves.

Over a white blanket of snow
there were imprints of three hundred
and fifty-two feet yesterday after-
noon following the Intramural An-
nual Cross Country Run. With the
cold wintry air whistling through
their jerseys, three Phi Kappa Psi
men. Farwell, Trowbridge, and Yaeg-

which gave their fraternity first place.

BADGERS-HAWKEYES
RENEW RIVALRY IN

DISTANCE CONTESTS

When the Badger and Iowa Cross
country teams meet at Madison
Homecoming Day, most of the old
grads will see their favorite race of
the year. The two conference
schools have long been keen rivals
in the long distance events, and
when the ten entrants from each
school start off over the hill and dale
Lake Mendota course one of the
prettiest races of the year will be
seen. The harriers will match their
skill over a distance of four and
nine-tenths miles. The Badgers after
their recent victory in the Chicago
quadrangular event feel that a Wis-
consin triumph will be the natural |
outcome.

Hoffman, Aaron. Goodman, Krieger,
Winning and Yaeger.

The day was extremely cold, the
course hard and slippery, and the
wind strong. Scores of spectators
lined the course.

Three men composed a team and
finished for their fraternities in the
following order: Phi Kappa Psi, Delta
Sigma Phi, Sigma Chi, Tau Delta Phi,
Delta Upsilon, Chi Psi, and Phi Kap-
pa Sigma. The winning teams were
chosen by taking the place in which
the first three members of a team
finished and adding them together
and the team having the lowest score
after this was done was the winner.

Grueling Race

The race started on time and with
the first gun the harriers lurched off
in a large bunch all fighting for the

The Maroon clad gridders are
being the guests of the various
fraternity houses, for dinner, and
for a general get together—to
talk over the coming battle. This
custom has been in vogue for sev-
eral years, before all the import-
ant football games.

Last week dinner was served for
the boys at the Deke and Psi U
houses. Last night they were the
guests of the S. A. E.’s and tonight
they will be at the Phi Psi house.
These dinners will continue until
the end of the football season.

STAGG SUPREMACY

IN HOCKEY; FROSH
CONTINUE TO LEAD

Freshmen women continued to hold
their lead in the interclass hockey
tournament by defeating the Sopho-
mores 2 to 1 yesterday on the Mid-
way. Seniors beat Juniors, 2 to 0,
and now hold second place in the
series.

The games were marked by long
slides and sudden tumbles and bore
strong resemblance to skiing meets.
Ann Port, L. W., was the outstanding
offensive player and Helene Eck-
stein. C. H., the most effective defen-
sive member of the Freshman team.
Helen Lamborn, L. F., and Alice
Wiles, C. H., starred for the Sopho-
mores. In the Soph forward line,
Irene Rothchild, Aline Grossman and
Florence Herzman vied for sliding
honors.

The Seniors out-coasted their op-
ponents in a close race, with their
defense living up to the good reputa-
tion acquired in previous games.
Polly Ames, L. F., was sliding cham-
pions for the Juniors.

The following scores show that in
the past games between Chicago and
Northwestern, Chicago has won
twenty-six; lost seven, tied three.
Chicago’s'last defeat in 1918. Chi-
cago has scored 649 total points as
compared to 123 for Northwestern.

schedule for all conference
has been growing worse,
schools have been accused of
ing an easy group of games

schools

Some
arrang-
for the

sole purpose of winning the cham-
pionship, while others have strained
inter-school relationship by an ar-
bitrary attitude in choosing their op-
ponents. This new plan, as present-
ed in the current issue of the Big Ten
Weekly, has the advantage of being
equally fair for every school, and of
being able to be worded out to a
mathematical certainly.

In the new plan each school would
have five conference games instead
of the four that some of them play
now. Three of these would be tradi-
tional rival games, that is, games
which have been played for a num-
ber of years. The two remaining
contests would be worked out on a
round-robin schedule. This schedule
would extend over a period of six
years. At the end of this period each
school would have played each round-
robin game twice. This would allow
one to be a home game and one to be
a traveling game.

The Maroons had another easy
night of it. That makes it three in
a row. Something should come of
this, for in previous weeks when
Stagg’s men worked harder than Tro-
jans they got no place the succeeding
Saturday. Now the work policy is
just opposite, and it is hoped that
the results obtained will also be op-
posite.

The drill was constituted, in the
main, of practice on the couple of
new open plays that plays that the
Old Man hqs conceived. Timing and
rhythm were especially stressed. The
interpretations were ragged. There
was no hard scrimmage, and the drill

took place beneath the shelter
north stand.

All the regulars reported.
Anderson was in suit, but did

of the

Kyle
no ac-

tive work. Stan Rouse’s ankle both-
ered him, but it is expected to be
in shape for the Northwestern game.
He hurt it again in the Illinois battle
after he had been out of practice on
its account for the week following
the Ohio game.

Whether to word or look

I cduld not say;

And though my eyes may often stray
To other eyes,
Yet I can say,
I have been faithful to you,

The current men’s styles are being
