FOR RECEPTION

OF PRESIDENT

Set New Date For Students
To Meet Pres. Mason
in Hutchinson

Undergraduates will be received by
President Mason at Hutchinson Com-
mons February 10. instead of Feb-
ruary 12, as previously announced,
Graham Hagey and Ainiee Graham,
co-chairmen of the reception, stated
yesterday.

Plans are being made by the com-
mittee to have at least 1,000 undergrad-
uates meet Pres’dent Mason person-
ally. Mrs. Mason will also be present
to greet the students, and several uni-
versity officials and their wives will
be in the receiving line.

The reception will be held at the
Commons from 7:30 to 9:30 o'clock.
There will probably be a three piece
orchestra, according to the committee’s
arrangements. Tentative plans are to
provide refreshments, also.

Invite All Undergraduates

The committee emphasizes the fact
that every undergraduate is invited, to
this reception, to hear President Ma-
son speak and to meet him. Some
time ago, in giving his impressions of
the University after his first quarter
here, in an interview which was pub-
lished in The Daily Maroon, President
Mason expressed a desire to become
better acquainted with the students of

the University.

Undergraduate

council, which is sponsoring the recep-
tion, hopes that the president's wish
may thus be partially gratified.

Anderson Introduces Speakers

Charles Anderson, president of the
Undergraduate council will introduce

the speakers,

Mason and

Vice-President F. C. Woodward. In
the receiving line Will be Mr. and Mrs.
Mason, Mr. and Mrs. Woodward. Mr.
and Mrs. C. S. Boucher, and Mr. and
Mrs. Robert V. Merrill. Mr. Boucher
is now acting dean of the college <■>*’,
arts, literature and science, in the ab-

sence of Dean E. H. Wilkins,

W. A .A. Purchases
Lodge at Palos Park

W. A. A. has secured from the coin-

inissioners of Cook County,

farm

house and twenty acres in Palos Park,
which the organization will use as a
lodge. This report was made yesterday
by the committee which has been look-
ing for a suitable site. The land is lo-
cated between 104th Street and 119th
Street, near the Palos Park ski slide
which it is expected will afford en-
joyment.

Committees to furnish the house and
to convert part of the grounds into
tennis courts and baseball diamonds
have been planned. Eleanor Fish has
asked every member of W. A. A. to
decide which committee she desires to
be on and report at once.

This lodge will be used throughout
the year by W. A. A. as a place for
recreation where the women may en-

Whether the Undergraduate council
was justified in forbidding a reporter
from The Daily Maroon to enter a
meeting has divided not only the coun-
cil itself, but the student body also.

This fact became apparent today
when members of the governing body

campus activities. At yesterday's meet-
ing, where the question was raised

and settled by a 9-2 vote.

Allen Miller, leader of the senior class,

unmistakable defeat.

The premiere of the Dramatic As-
sociation’s Playfest, as you know is
set for 8:30 tonight in Mandel. The
three one-act plays on the bill are not
due for a long run cither here or any-
where else, if present plans are fol-
lowed; tomorrow night, indeed, will
mark the only other performance of
Mr. Trebow’s mimes (good word,
mimes').

All this, however, is beside the point.
The real news is, not that the show’s
coming off tonight, but that I give it
my unqualified and expert approval.
Mr. Frank Hurburt O’Hara and the

board of Kleagles
thought it’d plug
some established
critic were to give

of the Playfest
the ticket sale if
campus dramatic
the show his en-

dorsement. Last night before dress
rehearsal, accordingly, they started to
look around.

But critics were rather scarce. Mr.
Alfred Frankenstein had taken himself
off to a bassoon recital, and there real-

ly wasn’t
around. At
last resort,
my doubts
setting up

another bona fide expert
the last moment, and as a
I was pressed into service,
as to my credentials for
as a critic cleared away,

and T myself let down into a seat in
Mandel to see the show. Thus it is •
that I. and not Mr. Frankenstein or
somebody with the true critic’s look,
give my sanction to whatever the as-
sociation sees fit to put on the boards

tonight.

For, even if it isn’t any bet-

ter than what T saw last night, it’ll
still be a very good show.

The first play which I saw was “The
Gat.” featuring Messrs. Kerr and
Webster, and a mail-order revolver.
(The Tribune can get an editorial out
of that). The revolver was shot off
at the end of the show, and that, on
the whole, was the big noise of the
performance.

DRAW THE BLINDS

T'HE undergraduate council has rejected a motion to admit re-
•*• porters from The Daily Maroon to its meetings. Reporters, the
members feared, might misconstrue the council’s proceedings; and
their presence the frank discussion necessary to the council’s success.
The result would be inaccurate stories and stilted meetings.

This decision shows a misunderstanding of the true nature of a
governing body. Government, the council apparently believes, is
a business to be carried on in secret. Questions are to be proposed,
discussed, and voted upon, behind closed doors; afterwards, the re-
sults are to be announced to the public which waits outside. Any
part of the discussion or voting which the public might misunder-
stand and disapprove is to be censored from the report; at any rate,
it is not to be stressed.

Such a view of government is out of date, in America at least,
by a century and a half. It is not the view that we, as citizens in
the making, ought to learn. Government is the public’s business;
and the public has the right to know in every detail how its business
is transacted. To say that the public might not understand, is no
argument; a council must so conduct its business that the public and
! *vep a reporter from The Daily Maroon) WILL understand. To
say that council-members would be embarrassed in an open meet-
ing, and afraid to say what they think, is a confession of weakness.
The councilor’s job is to say what he thinks, and to say it aloud. His
words must stand the test of-public criticism. He must speak and act
in broad daylight. If he is afraid, he is no true councilor.

WE’LL SEE YOU AT PLAYFEST

w

HEN the curtain goes up. at 8:30 tonight, campus talent, both
literary and dramatic, will be presented to the public at the

men in all of the dormitories, and
many clever stunts are being arranged,
according to Kathleen Bimrose, chair-
man of the Y. M. C. A. Campus Com-
munity committee, sponsoring the
event.

The purpose of this committee is
to foster closer relations between the
women of the university who live in
the dormitories and those who live off
the campus. The vodil is staged an-
nually as a part of its program.

Kelly hall is planning to present a
pantomine of A. A. Milne’s book of
verse. Green hall will burlesque
“There Wasa Crooked Man”, in very
clever style according to advance in-
dications. Foster hall's act will be
a pantomine of several Mother Goose
rhimes. Other halls are also working
on their acts. Special numbers will
be presented by Marie Lewis, Dorothy
Freund, Betty Le May and others

CAGEMEN HOPE TO

REPEAT OHIO WIN

GREEK CONTESTS

ARE ROUGH BUT

PLAY IS SPEEDY

Few Forfeitures Feature
Evening; Small
Crowd

By Bob Stern

Everybody, including both

the

players and the spectators seem to be
saving all of their pep for the Intra-
mural basket finals; or at least that
was the way things looked at the
games played in Bartlett last night.
The spectators were conspicuous by
their absence and the players were
conspicuous by reason of the rough
stuff that they tried to substitute for
good basketball and teamwork But
just because the boys played rough
and got all het up the games were
interesting to watch. No champion-
ship work was exhibited but probably
the wily basketeers are keeping some-
ing up their respective sleeves to use
in the semi-finals next week.

The Alpha Delt-Phi Gam tilt sched-
uled to be the high spot of the eve-
nings play was called off since the
Alpha Delts were initiating. Thus
far neither of the teams has been
bowed in defeat and the game would
have been a finish affair. The Chi
Psi’s and Phi Psi’s however staged a
nip and tuck battle that had all of the
earmarks of a real contest. A few
moments before the end of the fray
with the count 14 to 15 the game
was anybodies until the Chi Psi’s by
dint of having the better basket eyes
sank two counters to the Phi Psi’s
one and took the honors, 20 to 16.
The Phi Psi’s, last years champs,
might have turned the score around
if Drain had not held them in check
with a fine exhibition of guarding.

Easy Win

The Phi Kaps put on a runaway
act with the Lambda Chi Alpha tos-
sers and took home the bacon to a
tune of 47 tn 1. The looser’s guard-
ing was a bit weak and the Phi
Kaps bombarded the hoop with great
success. Hibbott with eight baskets,
Johnson with seven, and Christianson
with six led in the orgy of scoring.

The remaining games were fairly
even. Everyone on both teams broke
into the point column in the Phi Beta
Delta-Alpha Sig tilt with the Alpha
Sigs trailing on a 14 to 11 score.
Place and Padock accounted for the
Beta win over the Zetes, totalling
eighteen out of their team’s twenty-
one points. Eckstein and Westerman
did the heavy point work for the
Zetes, who were able to garner only
fifteen points to the Beta’s twenty-
one.

WHAT o7 IT?

ygQNie MORfiENSTE^N

What has happened to the stadium?
What has happened to the field house?
After all the uproar about a bigger
athletic plant, after all the false
starts on ground-breaking, there’s
neither a stadium rearing its pillars
upwards on Stagg Field or a field
house spreading itself over the ter-
ritory at Fifty-sixth and Greenwocd.
As the medicine men would chant, as
they prance with hunched shoulders
about the fire: “There’s something
rotten, there’s something rotten,
there’s something rotten in the state.”

My question (prompted by a receipt
of a letter from ‘Subscriber,’ of Rock-
ford, Ill.) are not rhetorical ones.
Unfortunately I am unable to offer
a solution to the problem of what has
happened to the bigger and better
stadium and field house movement. At
a loss as I am, I still throw out my
questions. Perhaps some condescend-
ing being among The Authorities will
answer them.

I am made the subject of a maud-
lin attack by Terrible Turk in today s
Whistle for my uncompromising at-
titude in regard to the chapel rush-
ing argument, presented yesterday in
“these columns.” Despite all the win-
dy mouthing of Turk, I feel it my
reluctant duty to extend my palm and
say, “Your hand, old man, your hand.’’
For Turk has come around to my view
after all. He has, doubtless, read my
yesterday’s column and seen the
light. He is for more and merrier
chapels. He acknowledges the chapel
as a forceful rushing argument. It is
such things as this that make me be-
lieve that, after all, even the most
ignorant of humankind can, by judi-
cious distribution of enlightening
reading matter among them, in time
be reclaimed from barbarism and
abject stupidity.

Green defeated Greenwood 21 to 18
after a bitterly contested battle and
Drexel ran away with Kelly to the
tune of 19 to 8 in the inter-dormitory
tournament games played last Wed-
nesday. The outcome of the struggle
between Green and Greenwood was ir
doubt until the last few minutes of
play since the score was tied through
a great part of the game and both
were playing their hardest. In th®
end Green came out victor becaus-
their teamwork was superior to that
of their opponents.

In the Drexel-Kelly battle Drexe1
got its advantage during the second
half and during the first part the
playing was about even on both sides.
As a result of last night’s contests
there have been several shifts in the
standings of the halls.

In the compiling of the average num-
ber of baskets scored by and on Big
Ten basketball teams thus far in the
conference race, Norgren’s Maroons
figure prominently. They are at the
bottom of the heap in one and at the
top in another, according to statistics
garnered by the Big Ten Weekly.

Maroons Average Low

The Bartlett performers have scored
an average of 6.3 baskets a game while,
conversely, they have been counted on
by an average of only 6.6 throws per
contest. This indicates that although
the Maroons are the poorest offensive
| team amongst thej* contemporaries
they also possess the sturdiest defense.
It accounts for their present .500 rat-
ing.

These same figures reveal the four
leaders in scoring; their averages are
Indiana, 12 baskets a game; North-
western, 11.8; Michigan, 11.6; Pur-
due, 11.2. However the defenses of
these same aggregations seem to suf-
fer in turn as they are also at the bot-
tom of the second column with the
following averages Michigan, 10; Pur-

Attention is now being centered
on the annual intra-mural bridge
tournament in which play will begin
this afternoon at 3:30. Thirty-six
teams have entered forming six
leagues. The leaders of each will
play for the University champion-
ship after completing their respec-
tive schedules.

Judging from the success attain-
ed in past years, indications point
to a good season and many hotly
contested matches are assured.

The department has scheduled a No-
vice meet for this afternoon which
will present all of the, events of the
j usual intercollegiate meetings .

The affair will be open only to
' those ’ undergraduates who have

Buckeye five. The locals won the in-
itial game by the narrow margin of
one point, but the retur contest is ex-
pected to be one grand fight from be-
ginning to end. though the Ohio Stat-
ers are doped to win.

Strong Defense

I he Maroon team is acknowledged
to be one of the strongest in the
Conference and is claimed to be un-
beatable on its own floor. But when
it travels away from home it loses this
seeming advantage, which has been
demonstrated by its losing all its out
of town engagements. The sometimes
disappointing but otherwise happy
thing about the games thus far this
season is the fact that they either lose
or win by a few points at the most.

The Fasteners (relatively) have a
squad which believes in the theory that
“the best defense is a good offense”
and hope to prove this theory which
has been all but tottering because of
the various Maroon upsets. They have
a team composed of five good shots
among whom “Cookie” Cunningham
is the outstanding luminary. The lo-
cals stopped him last week end, but
Olsen, Buck coach, may have perfect-
ed some new system of play by which
he will be able to score.

GRAPPLERS MEET

MINNESOTA TEAM

Coach Spiros K. \ orres will pit bis
potentially strong mat team against the
blond invaders from the north, when
the Maroons grapple with Minnesota
here tomorrow night. The Gophers
were decisively defeated by the Paul
Prehn’s powerful Illini wrestlers a few
weeks ago but they have now improv-
ed considerably and Vorres, expects
an exceptionally close contest.

In the 117 pound class the Maroons
will have Stoehr and Laverde with
Sternfield performing in the 127
pound class. Capt. Graham who has
developed into one of the most able
wrestlers in the Big Ten is expected
to register a fall against his opponent
in the lightweight division. Davis will
work in the welterweight ranks and
Tiancock bear the brunt of the work-
in the heavyweight division. The light-
heavy weight and middleweight repre-
sentatives have not yet been decided
upon.

folks back home were rolled up in the
second play, a parcel called “The Let-
ter.” Miss Louise Quinn and Mr.
Leo Stone, among others, were in
this. Miss Quinn was good. She
comes from my home town. Oak Park,
so I hear; that must explain it. Mr.
Stone (who provided neither mother-
love, self-sacrifice, or th’ folks back-
home part of it) was good, too. He
comes from Kalamazoo; that must ex-
plain it. The others were all good. too.
I don’t know where they come from:
that must explain it.

“Spiced Wine” was the third play.
Mr. Seward Covert was in “Spiced
Wine.” (Mind you, that’s not the
same as if 1 had said he was “in
liquor”). The Ladies Home Journal
has proved we ain't that kind of boys
around here. Covert wore tights. He
is, however, playing a serious par*—
indeed, he gets poisoned at the end. I
reiterate, Covert wore tights, but he
wasn’t.

i *	*

Besides the three plays, incidentally,
there are a couple of entr’actes. Mon-
sieur Henri David and his troupe of
trained seals—Frogs, I mean (that’s
another way of saying Frenchmen,
children)—will perform in one. \M>
Fuqua, one of th' boys, will do card
tricks in French, while Maurice Laclaff
will give readings from Victor Hugo’s
great work, “La Vie Parisienne."

Jerry Quinn, the gymnast, will
leave off swinging dumbells for the
two evenings to swing Joe Barron
around in what is technically termed
a soft-shoe dance. Some uncouth in-

dividual has risen up to remark, “Huh!
if it's Joe Barron he won't leave off
either.” But that is beside the point.
Prof. Frederic C. Woodward, master
of ceremonies for the occasion, will be
clever in divers ways. I have seen it
all,and I say it's good; for the modest
sum of $1.00, or six pins, you can have
the pleasure of encoring me.
