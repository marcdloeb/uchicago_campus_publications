THESIS PROVES
PAUL'S STENOG

KNEW GREGG’S

Henry O. Lloyd Reveal*
That Apostle Paul Had
Shorthand Writer

The apostle Paul had a stenog-
rapher who took down his letters in
shorthand, a recent examination of
Greek papyri, containing the orig-
inal documents of the New Testa-
ment, shows. A study of the bearing
of the Greek papyri on the New Tes-
tament made at the University by
Henry O. Lloyd, a graduate student,
revealed this fact today.

That the writing of shorthand in
those days was a definitely estab-
lished trade with a full apprentice-
ship is further shown in Mr. Lloyd’s
thesis. According to a contract of
155 A. D., he observes, an ex-magis-
trate of Oxyrhynchus apprenticed
his slave to a short hand writer.
Just what forms these writers used
is not clear. It is certain, however J
the investigators says, that the prin-
ciple of abbreviation in every pos-
sible circumstance was adopted, a
fact which has complicated the work
of modern translators considerably.

Stenographer* Human

To errors that often accompany
dictation may be attributed many
seeming inconsistencies in the New
Testament, Mr. Lloyd points out.
The stenographer or “semiographo”
may have been day dreaming or plan-
ning a feast for “that evening” while
he or she was recording the letter.

Affirming that by showing dicta-
tion and shorthand to be prevalent,
the papyri have considerably illum-
inated the study of Paul, Mr. Lloyd
continues: “Papyrus discoveries have
thrown light upon the form in which
the New Testament writings were

HAROLD VINAL, POET
AND PATRON OF ART,
TO READ HIS VERSE

Harold Vinal, poet and editor of
“Voices,” will talk informally and
read from his verse Tuesday at 8 in
the Reynold club theater. The read-
ing will be held under the auspices
of th? Poetry club and tickets have
been pitted on sale at fifty cents.

“Mr. V inal is in the city on his
first lecture trip to Chicago,” said
George Dillon, president of the Poet-
ry club. “He has received a great
deal of attention in the east, not
only because of his distinguished ser-
vices in the behalf of art in general
but also because of the charm and
individuality of his own poetry. Mr.
Vinal is known as one of the most
stimulating, witty, and effective lec-
turers in literary circles,” Dillon
ended.

PROF. T. CROSS TO
PRESENT IRISH POET

James Stephens, prominent Irish
poet who is making his second Chi-
cago appearance, will be presented
to his audience by Prof. Tom Peete
Cross of the University. Mr. Ste-
phens will speak Sunday evening,
Jan. 17 in the Recital Hall of the
Fine Arts building.

The poet made his first Chicago
appearance in recent years here at
the University last Spring when he
was well received by his audience.

"ickets will be $1.50, and may be
procured at Alexander Greene’s
bookshop, 803 Fine Arts building or
bv mail to that address if accom-
panied by a self-addressed envelope.

“MAC” WEARS TRACK
SUIT; NOT HIS FAULT

While practicing for Intramural
basketball in Bartlett gymnasium
the other day, Austin (Five Yard)
McCarty was relieved of a new
ninety-five dollar overcoat and a
suit of clothes. In the pockets of
his clothes were the keys to his
car and fifteen dollars in curren-
cy. When questioned later as to
whether he recovered the clothes
or not, McCarty answered, “Oh,
shut up; I’m sour.”

McCarty is not the only man
who has lost valuables in the gym-
nasium. Time and again students
who are careless about closing
their lockers retunr to find that
their property has been disturbed.
Inasmuch as this condtion exists
and no practical means has been
found to stop it, Mack, the locker
attendant, advises every patron of
the gymnasium to put his things in
his locker and to lock it.

PHOENIX BOARD
ADDS TO STAFF

Additions Made to Editorial
and Business Depts.

Ten undergraduates were added to
the editorial staff, and three to the
business staff, of the Phoenix at a
meeting of that publication’s govern-
ing board yesterday afternoon.

Rainey Bennett, Jane Bruening,
Allen Heald, Robert Lauter, Victoria
Smith, Josephine Waters, Irma Selz,
Stuart Bradley, Harriet Renick, and
Lou Frohlich won positions on the
art and editorial divisions, while
Kenneth Engel, Wilburt Frindley,
and William Stevenson have been
added to the business department.

Announcement to all contributors
that the office hours of the Phoenix
board will be from 3 to 4 every day
was made, and the deadline for the
next issue was decided upon. All ma-
terial for the January Phoenix must
be in by Thursday, Jan. 14.

Details of the “collegiate Ford”
contest will be revealed in the forth-
coming issue, and the contest, for
which prizes will be awarded in the
way of inducement, will begin the
following month.

FRIAR AUTHORS TO

WRITE FIRST ACTS

Prospective authors of Blackfriar
books are urged by Hamilton Cole-
man, the producer, to write their first
acts and lyrics from their scenarios
and to get them ready for judging.
He asked that all scenarios be shown
to him before detailed work on the
first act is started.

Many are competing for the honor
of being the author of the play, Cole-
man declared, but there is yet time
to complete and hand in any yet un-
finished manuscripts. The judging
date will be announced in an early
issue of The Daily Maroon. Until
that time prospective authors and
composers are asked to apply them-
selves to their work.

Plan Informal Tea
for Entering Women

Entering women will be enter-
tained at a tea sponsored by Federa-
tion Tuesday from 4 to 6 around the
fire-place in the Y. W. room of Ida
Noyes hall. The presidents of the
three women’s organizations on cam-
pus will be present. All entering
women with their upper class coun-
sellors have been invited to attend.

DRAMATS HOLD
FIRST TRYOUTS

FOR PLAY FEST

Short Plays Comprise Pro-
gram To Be Presented

For Settlement

Plans for the University’s annual
“Winter Play Fest” which is given
each year for the benefit of the Uni-
versity settlement are now being
made. The program will, as usual,
consist of short plays written by
students, and presented under the
auspices of the University Dramatic
association.

This production is the association’s
biggest attempt of the year, accord-
ing to George Bates, president. It is
therefore necessary that the student
body of the university give its heart-
est co-operation.

Set Tryout Date

Tryouts for the Play Fest will be-
gin Tuesday at 3:30 and all candi-
dates must be on hand. According
to Margaret Joseph, all those inter-
ested in setting and costuming as
well as acting should be present at
this time.

To Know People
Live With Them,

Dr. Cole Advises

To write a book on a country of
which one knows only the rudimen-
tary customs is an impossible task,
according to Dr. Fay Cooper Cole,
associate professor in the depart-
ment of Anthropology.

“A person from Mars without
knowledge of the earth might inter-
pret the most ordinary actions of
persons here very differently from
the way he would if he knew all of
the facts of the case. For instance,
the inhabitant of Mars might attend
a church on earth, and because the
people were kneeling, infer when he
visited a gymnasium that it was an-
other church.” So said Dr. Cole as
we approached him for an interview.
“That is the reason why we anthrop-
oligists live with the persons of a
country, to obtain a better concep-
tion of the conditions under which
they live.”

Mr. Cole has spent some time in
Asia and the Philippines obtaining in-
formation for books. He has also col-
lected specimens as illustrations for
the Field Museum of Natural Sci-
ence.

CONTINUE NEW SET’
OF RADIO LECTURES

That education should be for char-
acter rather than the mere collection
of information and that this is the
modern tendency in all scientific
teaching is the opinion of Prof. W.
W. Charters, of the school of educa-
tion. Consequently he is not sure
of the respective merits of the small
college and great modern university.

This at least is the gist of the
lecture which Prof. Charters will de-
liver from Mitchell Tower at 9
o’clock next Tuesday night. Prof.
Charter’s title will be, “Education
and Personality.”

The second of the series of radio
lectures which Prof. Percy Holmes
Boynton is supervising will be de-
livered next Thursday night. The
lecturer will be Prof. C. E. Merriam,
head of the department of political
science. This series on “American
Life” will be continued for several
more weeks.

Accessories Make
The Ensemble; So
Did Santa Claus

Notice the way the campus has
been brightened lately? Have you
been overcome by a sudden blaze of
many colors of every variety and
hue? Yes, Christmas has come and
gone; the holly and mistletoe have
disappeared; the dances and gayety
of the Yuletide season are now only
pleasant memories. But still remains
the warmth and glory of the holi-
days; the Christmas ties are now up-
on us.

Oh Christmas - tide how many out-
rages are committed in thy name?
Throughout the rest of the year this
bit of masculine wearing apparel is
selected with a reasonable degree of
choice and discretion. But at Christ-
mas time they’re gifts.

PROF. ATTACKS

OLD FALLACIES

Boynton Discusses Isolation
and Manifest Destiny

“Out of the first wave of national
enthusiasm following the American
Revolution arose two particular con-
vi^ions which have had a demoral-
izing effect to the present day,’’ as-
serted Prof. Percy Holmes Boynton,
in a radio lecture last night. “One
fallacy concerns the magnificent iso-
lation of the United States, and the
other its manifest destiny which re-
lieves the citizen from responsibility
toward the government.”

Tracing the development of the at-
titude that the affairs of Europe are
of no concern in this country, Prof.
Boynton asserted that George Wash-
ington’s warning against entangling
alliances was meant to apply to a
definite contemporary political prob-
lem.

Despite policies of isolation, Amer-
ica had often become embroiled with
European countries, Prof. Boynton
said.

HOME WORKER SEEKS
RECRUITS ON CAMPUS

Miss Laura Parker, the executive
supervisor of work among the “farm
and cannery migrants” of Delaware,
Maryland, and eastern Pennsylvania
will be a guest of the Y. W. C. A.
on Tuesday. Miss Parker wishes to
meet and talk with any campus wom-
en who may be interested in paid
summer work among these people in
the Y. W. office on the second floor
in Ida Noyes hall.

For the last five years, undergrad-
uates from eastern and middle west-
ern schools have been doing this, type
of work.

The work which Miss Parker super-
vises is of the home missionary type,
in which workers care for and edu-
cates the younger children of the^
foreign families who emigrate with
the crop seasons and are engaged in
harvesting and canning.

Prof. Hering to Talk
on ‘Christian Science’

———— •

“Christian Science and the World’s
Redemption,” will be the subject of
a lecture to be delivered under the
auspices of the Christian Science So-
ciety by Prof. Hermann S. keying,
C. S. B., of Boston, Mass., Monday
at 4:30 in Mandell hall. /

Prof. Hering is a member ifthe
Board of Lectureship of The Mother
Church, The First Church of Christ,

UNDERGRAD. COUNCIL

SEEKS CRITICISMS OF

CAMPUS INSTITUTIONS

Student Council Plans Report On University’s
Shortcomings As Evidenced By Comments
Received In Chapel Next Week

When interviewed on the plan
of the Undergraduate council to
question the seniors on four years’
mpressions and suggestions, Pres-
dent Max Mason and Dean Ernest
Hatch Wilkins, Dean of the Col-
’eges, concurred in their belief
that the project could result in no
.arm, and would doubtless be of
-reat benefit to the University.
They feel that the cooperation
vhich is necessary for develop-
nent must begin with the student
ndy.

“Although I have not been informet
of the details of this plan,” stated
President Mason, “any project that
tends toward betterment through co-
operation meets with my sympathy.
We are all pardners here, and a better
school can be developed only when the
trustees, faculty, and students work
together. Since the student body is
fundamental in the betterment of the
University, I heartily endorse any
move for co-operation that the stu-
dents may make.”

Supporting President Mason’s atti-
tudetude toward the proposed project,
Dean Ernest Hatch Wilkins declared,
“I see nothing but good in the work
which the Undergraduate Council is
about to undertake. If any branch
of the school needs criticism, and we
know that we have not reached per-
fection, there are none better able to
express an opinion than those who
have been on campus for four years.”

TIME EXTENDED FOR

SUBMITTING GORDON

CONTEST SPEECHES

Extension of the time limit until
Monday noon, Jan. 11, for the prep-
aration of orations for the annual
Anna A. Gordon oratorical contest
was granted yesterday.

Papers were due today according
to the original announcement but ad-
ditional time was given so that stu-
dents might take advantage of the
week-epd to work on their papers.

The general topic of the contest
is prohibition and the reasons for its
failure. Papers that are submitted
Monday will be turned over to a com-
mittee of judges who will select the
best five for oral presentation. The
winning oration will then be entered
in the competition for the best es-
say in the state.

•1LIPINOS TO HONOR

MARTYR AT BANQUET

To commemorate the death of Dr.
/ose Rizal, Filipino patriot and mar-
tyr, the Filipino Triangle club of the
University, is giving a banquet and
program tomorrow at 6:30 in the
Gold Room of the Chicago Beach Ho-
tel.

Dr. Rizal was executed by the
Spanish authorities in the Philippines,
Decemler 30, 1925, because of his
expose < / the tyranny of the Spanish
regime in the islands. His death,
however, only served to set aflame
the Filipino revolution, then in its in-
.piency, and ultimately led to i
final overthrow of the Spanish rub
n the Orient.

When members of the senior class
come to chapel one week from Thurs-
day they will be given an opportun-
ity to express their critical opinion
on any department or institution of
the University and its function. This
is the plan of the Undergraduate
council as presented and suggested by
Charles Anderson.

College problems will be intim-
ately treated on the slip, which will
be passed among the seniors, by crit-
icisms which will be based on three
years association with the University.

Sort Opinion*

After the individual opinions h^e
been collected by the council they
will be sorted departmentally. Those
dealing with the English department
will be turned over to its head;
those with the school of education to
the head of that department, and
so on.

Those criticisms which do not have
definite bearing on anyju^jvjdi^l de-
partment will be turned over to twen-
ty student committees appointed by
the council. After all results have
been examined, digested, and com-
piled, a report will be made by the
council which should sound the key-
note of the University’s chief short-
comings, if there are any.

Want Comments

“The fundamental objective of the
scheme,’’ said Charles Anderson, au-
thor of the idea, “is to obtain a
frank impressionistic opinion of the
University from the senior’s point of
view. The greater the number of
comments, the more we shall be pleas-
ed. Every bit of criticisms will be
carefully indexed be it constructive
or destructive.”

“This will mark a new epoch of
activity in the annals of the Under-
graduate Council,” said George
Wiemer, president of the Junior
class, and member of the council, last
night.

ANNOUNCE JUDGES
FOR SONG CONTEST

Announcement has been made of
the three judges for the W. A. A. col-
lege song contest. They are Mrs.
Charles R. Robbins, who instigated
the idea, Mack Evans, director of the
University choir, and Harris R. Vail,
music director of University High
School. The prize winners of the
contest will be announced next week.

The contest is open to everyone
and a five dollar gold piece will be
awarded to the winner. All songs
must be in the W. A. A. office by
Monday, according to Eleanor Fish,
president of the organization. “The
purpose of the contest is to cre-
ate some new collegiate or loyalty
songs for the University,” Miss Fish
continued.

End Chicago Song

Contest Monday

Monday will end the college song
contest, which is being sponsored by
W. A. A. All manuscripts must be
submitted on or before that day, ac-
cording to Eleanor Fish, president of
the organization. The names and ad-
dress of the person submitting the
manuscript should be written on the
reverse side of the song sheet.

the brevity of the books and the
inaccuracies of quotation now that
we know how awkward was the type
employed.

“Knowledge that rolls were em-
ployed also checks the idea of mixed
up leaves in John, as leaf books were
probably unknown, or nearly so,
then. There seems to have been the
additional handicap of scarcity of
material, judging by the way the
same papyri have been used over
again, back and front. Then, too, the
exceeding destructability of the ma-
terial has thrown light on many prob-
lems such as why the end of a book
like Mark is missing, and why sec-
tions of a letter have found their
way into the wrong context, broken
bits together in the same file having
been unfortunately pieced together
by a later copyist.’’

ANNOUNCEMENT

'T'HE Daily Maroon has made a shocking discovery.

X Through its expert sleuthing seArice (which undermines
the whole campus, and pries into the Quadrangles' deepest
mysteries) your newspaper has learned something that will
alarm its dullest reader.

It is too late in the week to print so important an expose.
We must lock it in our desk till next week. We trust, however,
that our readers will watch this colum closely for further dis-
closures.

____________________________________________________________i1

A NEW-BETTER-YET

'T'HE undergraduate council has done something. Its president
A has roused it to action on his All-For-Chicago project.

The plan is this: The council asks the seniors for suggestions. It
asks them what their problems are, what complaints they have, what
work it ought to undertake. The Better Yet cMhpaign used the same
scheme, with success.

We have plenty of problems to report, plenty of complaints to
throw into the ballot box next Thursday noon, plenty of knots for
the council to untie. Some of us would like to see changes in the
coaching system. Many of us have fault to find with the courses
in physical culture. The University libraries have their shortcom-
ings. The honor system sometimes fails to work. The activities will
get their share of knocks.

The All-For-Chicago project will state such problems in a con-
crete form. It will give a picture of our difficulties as we ourselves
see them. It will put the questions direct.

The council will have at hand data that councils have not had
before. With that material, it can build up a program.

MEET HAWKS IN FIRST BIG TEN GAME

Open 1926

ATTENDANCE OF
COEDS FEATURE
OPENING NIGHT

All Gaines Are Run Off
Smoothly; Play Is
Good

A very busy place was Bartlett (»ym
last night, when twenty-two frater-
nities brought their teams and rooters
there to open the inter-fraternity bas-
ketball season, most popular of all in-
tramural winter sports. From 7:15 un-
til 10:15 the three small courts were
in constant use, and with several
games going on at once, accompanied
by the yelling of the spectators and
whistles of the referees, the old gym
was shaking worse than a dance hall
crowded with Charlestoners.

Hhwever, an interesting scene was
presented with so varied an assembly.
'There were, for example, all colors of
the rainbow, to say nothing of all the
letters in the Greek Alphabet repre-
sented there on the outfits worn by
the |warm of athletes. There was on
display almost every stive of basket-
ball, as played from coast to coast.
There were close games for the spec-
tators who did not care who won. and
there were run-away games for those
who did care.

Good sportsmanship and hard play-
ing characterized every contest, and
the alibies offered by the loosers were
good ones. It was a highly successful
beginning for what is predicted by
Gordon Wallace, Intramural man-
ager for basketball, to be one of the
best features on the Intramural pro-
gram.

Several teams looked very good in
their play last night, among them the
A. T. O’s, Dekes, Phi Gams, Phi Psis,
Phi Sigs an;J others, but early games
do not indicate very accurately what
the final rating will be after the men
get in condition and the teams get
their team work perfected. There were
no upsets last evening as there was
no dope to start with. Nobody, not
even the players themselves, knew just
what there chances were, but now that
the teams have made their debut and
showed whjt they have, the old dope
bucket will soon be put into use.

Deke-Alpha Delt

So far the best game of the evening
was played by the Dekes who copped
from the Alpha Delts by a score of 27
to 21. Both teams exhibited fine team
work during the fray, but the winners
had their eyes on the basket and sank
most of their shots.	*

Crimson Editorial Rouses Ire

Of Some, Approval Of Others

By Victor Roterus

Since the Harvard Crimson’s very
outspoken and direct article on foot-
ball reform appeared some weeks ago,
the leading dailies of the east have
hurriedly gone on record as either
approving of or opposing the drastic
proposals offered by that college or-
gan.

The editorial was the result of the
yelps of football reform agitators who
were more than usually audible and
in evidence during the past year. Un-
like the rumblings of previous years
when the attack was aimed at bru-
talism, the protests of these untiring
advocators ahd been directed at the
menace and evils of professionalism

and at the commercialism or football
hysteria so prevalent during the
months of October and November.

Some of the features included in
the now-famous editorial were:

1.	That all students who
play football be assigned
teams.

2.	That all October games

want to
to class

be mere-

ly intramural or interclass games.

3. That three intercollegiate games
be played the following month against

only such schools that are
out a similar program.

4. That an endowment be
support these games, thus

carrying

made to
relieving

football from paying the entire cost
of the athletic program.

WHAT of IT?

WORft MQ^GENSTifqj

“I have been around here long
enough,” writes Maroon Toque, “to
appreciate the justice of your remarks
on the productivity of the Chicago in-
terscholastics in the way of athletes. 1
can. with some stretch of imagination,
conjure up the names of some Maroon
athletes who were lured into school
by the strong-arm boys during some
one of the interscholastics, but the list
is not so long. On the other hand,
the percentages of prep stars who
eluded the wiles of our most repre-

sentative collegians and went

where else to
hugely.

‘‘During the

some-

school looms up rather

holidays I had occasion
of the boys who was a

classmate of mine in high school, and
who is now attempting. Mr. Zuppke
notwithstanding, to develop into one
of those $100,000 football players at
the University of Illinois. He was
telling me of the Illini freshman squad,
and from all accounts it is a whale.
The freshman captain this fall, one
Timm of * Twin Falls. Idaho, my
friend declared to be in line for al-
most as much publicity as the Big
Ice Man From Wheaton who just left
the Twin Boroughs. My friend did
not expect that Mr. Timm’s jersey
would 'be enshrined in the Illinois
trophy case (a la Grange) upon grad-
uation, but all the same he said that
the Twin Falls Tornado (I am an-
ticipating the Herald-Examiner) will
do until something better turns up.

"Memory harks back to a day in
May last spring, that day. to be prices,

scholastic 1 rack Meet was being held’
here tor the laudable purpose of broad-
ening the mind of the growing high
school athletes of the nation, strength-
ening the great principles of amateur
sport in this glorious country, etc.,
etc. And, as I recollect, one Timm of
Twin Falls, Idaho, was running hith-
er and yon, getting in a dish here, a
hurdle there, and generally occupying
himself to the business of bringing
honor and glory to dear old Twin
Falls High.

8. That unnecessary newspaper pub-
licity and the picking of all-star teams
be discouraged.

The New York Times declared con-
cerning the article: “The remedies
proposed strike at the root of the evil.”
The New York World said in regard
to the proposals: “They are shrewd
and they are genuine.” The Boston
American, however, treats the discus-
sion lightly: “After all, whaever Har-
vard does, football will still be the
greatest game in the world.” The
Providence News is cynical: “We
shall not trust very strongly in Har-
vard's leadership of the cause until af-
til after a season when the Cambridge

men shall have defeated Princeton
twenty and Yale by forty points.”

BEGIN CLASSES FOR
WOMEN FENCERS ON
MONDAY AFTERNOON

Women’s fencing classes will begin
Monday at 3:30 in the corrective gym
nasium of Ida Noyes hall. It is an in-
novation for women, as previous to
the winter quarter the art of fencing
was taught only to men.

Classes will be held twice a week,
on Mondays and Thursdays. All those
women who are interested in this sport
must pay the required fee. which is
five dollars for ten lessons, before
Monday afternoon. The checks should
be made payable to Dr. Alvan Hen-
nanson and placed in an envelope ad-
dressed to Harriet Ray, representa-
tive of minor sports on the W. A.

A. board. They may be left with
Wheelan in the check-room of
Noyes hall.

The required costume consists

Ida

of a

long-sleeved middy, bloomers, rubber-
soled shoes, and old street gloves. An
attempt is being made to interest the
women of the'University in athletics
by offering sports of an unusual sorts.
It is hoped that the results of this
effort will aid in eliminating the pre-
valing idea that "gym” is a necessary
evil.

SPLASHERS HOLD

PRACTICE MEET

The swimming meet

to be held
Gym nata-

tonight at the Bartlett

torium has been the center of atten-

tion for the past few days. With the
return of many stars of past years
the Freshman-Alumni combination
has been strengthened considerably,
and the chances are that the Varsity
men Will have to do their utmost in
order to cope with their opponents
fast times.

Another added feature of the meet
will be the addition of the men who
are ineligible for Varsity competition
this season, to the Frosh Alumni
duet, thus making the team a trio.
The ranks of the Varsity squad have
been somewhat impaired by ineligi-
bility, thus weakening it consider-
ably, and adding strength to the al-
ready mighty combination.

The line-up and order of events
will be as follows: Relay team, Var-
sity, Captain Noyes, Rittenhouse,
Redfield and Greenburg. For the
Frosh-Alumni: Protheroe, Blinks,
Dorf, Byler, Blinks and Jenkins.

200 yard breastroke: varsity, Myg-
dal, Diamond, Baurucher; Jenkins,
Florez, Harkins, freshman alumni.

Forty yard crawl: Noyes and Rit-
tenhouse, varsity; Protheroe, Blinks
and Oker, freshman alumni.

440 yard crawl: Lane, Greenburg,
Krogh, varsity; Boyer, Lavezzorio,
freshman alumni.

(Continued on page 4)

gren’s harried Maroons will jog out
on the Bartlett floor to take on, for
better or for worse, Mr. Sam Barry’s
imposing Iowa basketball team. The
Maroons have won one and lost three
so far, while the Hawkeyes have
dropped a one-point game to Notre
Dame, and won three. If there is
material for drawing conclusions in
this information, you are at liberty
to do so.

Maroon Play Erratic

1 he Maroons are suffering from
their usual early season inability to get
started. I hey have devoted too much
of their time in games to midfloor
manoeuvering and pottering around.
Against Drake this was especially no-
ticeable, but the boys came to life in
the last seven minutes and made

enough points so that they were beat-
en respectably.

Norgren probably would like to
change his men around, but he lacks
enough high class material to allow
much shifting. John McDonough at
guard has been consistently satisfying,
and Zimmerman at forward has got
in some good bits, but the rest of the
players have been rather too consist-
ently ragged for much enjoyment in
the Chicago stands.

Alyea Playing Well

Capt. Alyea at center has been play-
ing a fairly good floor game, but he
has not been going at a really fast
pace at any time. His three baskets
in the last minutes of the Drake game
represent his only sustained scoring
burst, but inability to hit the basket
has been a common failing with all
the Maroons right along. McConnell,
a good scorer and floor man, may get
a crack at center against Iowa.

The Hawkeyes are a strong passing
team, with three veterans to carry
things along. Capt. Van Deusen, a

especially the athletes, are overworked.” Prof. H. S. Canby, Yale.

DEAN IN HOSPITAL FROM OVERWORK

JORDAN TELLS
HOW SCIENCE

FIGHTS FEVER

University Bacteriologist De-
scribes Progress of Science
in Recent Years

Successful drives, in both the lab-
oratory and the clinical fields, which
have immensely reduced the death rate
in many of the deadly diseases were
reviewed by Dr.\ Edwin Oakes Jor-
dan, chairman of the Department of
Bacteriology at the University in a
public lecture last evening at Orches-
tra hall.

Under the title “The Conquest of
Disease,’ Dr. Jordan, who is one of
the most widely known bacteriologists
and health authorities in the United
States, described the impressive prog-
ress made by mankind during the last
few decades in combatting disease,
particularly such scourges as typhoid,
diphtheria, malaria and scarlet fever. I

Describes Medical Warfare

Having illustrated processes and
effects through this discussion of
diphtheria, Dr. Jordan took up the
warfare waged, in America and
throughout the world, upon that dis-
ease, and also upon tuberculosis, ty-
phoid, malaria and scarlet fever. He
showed by means of charts displayed
on stereopticon slides just what curve
the death rate from tuberculosis in
the United States * took during the
years from 1812 to 1911.' The chart
showed at a certain point, at about 1885
a sudden drop in the death rate, con-
tinuing more or less consistently. That
point when the death rate began to
"toboggan” came with the discovery
of the tubercule bacillus—a discovery

WINNER OF CONTEST
TO BE ANNOUNCED AT
SONG FEST THURSDAY

"Sing-a-ma-jig” for all university
women will be held under the auspices
of W. A. A. Thursday at 3:30 in the
main gymnasium of Ida Noyes hall.
This affair has been planned for the
pleasure of all university women who
enjoy singing and for those who would
like to learn the best-known college
songs.

Mrs. Charles Robbins, accompanied
by her daughter, Helen, will lead the
sing. She will be recognized by a
great number of women as the song
leader in the various gymnasium class-
es last quarter. Upperclass women
may remember her from former years.
At this time the announcement of the
prize winner of the song contest con-
ducted by W. A. A. will be made. "We
consider ourselves very fortunate that
Mrs. Robbins has consented to at-
tend,” said Eleanor Fish, president of
the organization.

FEDERATION GREETS
NEW WOMEN TODAY

Presidents, of the three women’s or-
ganizations, Y. W. C. A., W. A. A.,
ind Federation, will speak informally
at a tea to be sponsored by Federation
today from 4 to 6 in the Y. W. C. A.
room of Ida Noyes hall.

“The purpose of this tea is to ac-
quaint the entering women with other
women on the campus and to endeavor
to create a spirit of friendliness be-
tween the women. It is thought that
gathering around the fire in the Y.
W. C. A. room will give an excellent
opportunity to the women to become
acquainted with each other,” said Bet-
ty LeMay, chairman of the publicity
committee. Women have been urged
to attend with their upper class coun-
cillors.

Borneo Pygmies
Without Beauty

Aids Says Cole

Every man is his own architect and
every w’oman her own modiste among
the pygmies on the island of Palawan
north of Borneo, according to Prof.
bay-Cooper Cole, anthropologist of
the University, who described this
group of people in a radio lecture last
Friday night through The Daily News
station, WMAQ.

“There are no beauty parlors, per-
manent waves arc permanent, and fa-
cial creams are quite unknown,” Prof.
Cole said. But the pygmies beautify
their bodies with scars from self-
inflicted wounds.

Most of the food supply conies from
hunting, and all the members of a
pygmy settlement share alike, no mat-
ter who kills the game. Their society
is almost entirely communistic with-
out private property or ownership of
land.

They are very low in the scale even
of primitive peoples, according to the
lecturer, who cited the Palawan trible
to illustrate the definite facts which
modern sciences has been able to learn
about the infancy of the human race.

Ancient Flints Found to Date

Back One-hundred Thousand Yrs.

A thousand pieces of flint, chipped
by the hand of primitive man. and
brought to the University of Chicago
from Egypt by Dr. James H. Breasted,
noted Egyptologist, have been classi-
fied in a study made for the depart-
ment of anthropology by Miss Louise
Cross and have been found to date
back at least to the palaeolithic era
from 50,000 to 100,000 years ago.

Dr. Breasted’s discovery of these
flints was one of the things leading to
his request to the General Education
Board of New York for additional
funds with which to carry on excava-
tions in the caverns of the Nile to de-
termine the chronological sequence
and parallel development of prehistoric
man in Egypt. Miss Cross’s work is
the first effort made at the University
of Chicago to record evidence of pre-
historic craftsmanship from the The-

New Chute Stops
Maiming of Books

At Harper E-l 1

E-ll books will have better care,
will be rebound less often and will be
in better condition generally in con-
sequence of the enlarged chute for the
return of books which was just com-
pleted, according to Mr. E. A. Henry,
head of the Readers’ department of
the University libraries.

The improved return chute was built
to facilitate handling books on the
part both of students and library em-
ployees. With the old return system,
no more than about a dozen books
could be placed in the chute at the
same time, said Mr. Henry. A pass-
ing student, in a hurry to get his
book back on time, would thrust it
against the line already filling the
opening and this final push would be
enough to break the binding of sev-
eral of the books. Some of the smaller
and lighter books would fall to the
floor because nothing had been con-
structed to keep them on ‘the table at
the base of the chute.

Four times as many books may now
be accommodated by the remodeled
chute. This, said Mr. Henry, means
less harsh treatment for them, and a
preservation of the •bindings. A rail-
ing has also been built to prevent
books from falling from the table if
they have been thrown down with too
much force.

ban heights.

Louise Cross Makes Analysis

By comparison with findings of Eu-
ropean archeologists and study of the
various types of flint in the collection.
Miss Cross has been able to conclude
that the University’s collection “shows
at least some upper palaeolithic as well
as undoubted lower palaeolithic char-
acteristics.” and that “it is of extreme
antiquity.” Moreover, marked similar-
ity has been found between the Egyp-
tian flints and those discovered in Eu-
rope by scholars in Continental fields.
The former have characteristics iden-
tical with those of the European Chel-
lean, and Moustercian epochs.

Miss Cross continues: “In Egypt
Dr. Breasted has gone over the avail-
able material, and has published the
results in his articles on ‘Origins of
Civilization’. The same flints were evi-
dently washed down from the heights
and deposited before the Nile began
to fall in its level and to develop from
the lacarstrine stage into river with
sufficient current for cutting dowp the
present river terraces. They are em-
bedded in great numbers in the rock
of the upper river terraces, which was
hard enough in the Eleventh dynasty
(2160 to 2000 R. C.L to be excavated
for tombs.

Flints Indicative of Culture

“Even if the cutting did not occur
until the second interglacial period of
Europe—based on prabable relations
between the pluvial of Africa and the
glacial of Europe—these flints are con-
siderably older, and must antedate
any certain dating of European arti-
facts?

ELECT EIGHT WOMEN
TO MAROON STAFF

Three sophomore women have been
elected to the staff of The Daily Ma-
roon as sophomore editors. Madge
Child, Betty McGee and Doris Mode,
will fill these positions until the end
of the spring quarter when formal elec-
tions <vill be held.

Marie Gelpern, Harriett Harris,
Harriet Lemon, Kathryn Sandmeyer,
and Irma Selz are the five freshmen
who will be retained as reporters.

Freshman women who wish to try
for staff positions may meet with Ger-
trude Bromberg, woman’s editor, any
day from 2:30 to 3:30 in The Daily
Maroon office.

Experiment Upon

Maroon • Athletes

With Violet Ray

College football like ultra-modern
wars may be waged in the laboratory
with the aid of test tubes and micro-
scopes, if the highly unique ideas buzz-
ing in the brain of Simon Benson, new
University athletic trainer, work out
into facts. Benson, who in addition
to his capacities as a guide to Maroon
athletes, has the added distinction of
being a chemist, plans to work out1
some of his theories in thv training
quarters.

He is interested mainly in the action
of ultra-violet rays on the human body
and he intends to find out exactly how
they work and why. He intends to
study the treatment he gives the Ma-
roon warrior with the ultra-violet ray
equipment in Bartlett gymnasium and
then report his findings to the chem-
istry laboratory. Wherever the results
hold possibilities of improving the con-
dition of the body, they will be applied
io the athlete. Thus both pure science
and applied science will benefit. Ben-
son points out.

“Many of the beneficial effects of
ultra-violet rays are known to science,
but there is much to be uncovered,”
says Benson. “The training quarters
where individuals are treated daily
with therapeutic light afford an excel-

lent laboratory in which to carry on in-
vestigations. I am interested specifi-
cally in the action of light on food;
to what -extent it will produce vita-
m*res and so forth.

“If the studies turn out successfully
(and al! scientific matters are extreme-
ly problematical), we shall attempt to
apply what we have learned to athletic
training, thereby allowing athletes to
benefit from the theoretical problems
of pure science, and as light has been
shown to have a very pronounced ef-
fect on certain foods, it is obvious that
the two subjects have a very definite
relationship and that one can supple-
ment the other.”

It is believed that Benson is the
first theoretical scientist to be added
to a university athletic staff. He con-
troverts the popular notion that train-
ing quarters are habituated by rough
and ready gentlemen who wear iron
hats and jerseys and who know as
much about anatomy as Babe Ruth
or Harry Wills.

Select Recipients
Of Henry Strong -

Scholarship Award

Eight students of the University,
twice as many as are usually honored,
have been chosen by Dean Ernest
Hatch Wilkins to receive the Henry
Strong scholarship, given by the
Henry Strong Educational Founda-
tion. They are Jeanette Baldwin. W.
H. Abbott, Helen Wooding, Mel-
bourne Boynton, Lois Gilldnders and
Hugh Allen Miller, all of whom have
received the $250 scholarship. Two
other students, Harry Ziggler and
Jack Langford, have received individ-
ual scholarships of $125. ,

These scholarships offer aid to stu-
dents who have not only, high grades
but also such characteristics as will
tend to leadership and traits proving
the student worthy of receiving this
honor. General Henry Strong is the
donor of the scholarship.

Usually only four students are se-
lected by Dean Wilkins to receive the
scholarship, but because cf the unusual
work of the eight students mentioned
above, all of them have b *en presented
with the scholarship.

These students will receive annually
a sum not exceeding $600 each and for
no longer a period of time than until
‘hey shall become twenty-five years of
age, according to the provisions In
General Strong’s will.

FROSH HEATEDLY
DISCUSS FORCED

M. S. IN FORUM

'Compulsory military training at
the University of Chicago was the
proposition which precipitated a
heated discussion at a meeting of
the Freshman Forum in Cobb hall
yesterday afternoon. The prepon-
derance of opinion among those
who spoke was opposed to such a
system.

Those who favored military train-
ing advocated it as a defense against
possible attack, an opinion which
was opposed by the argument that
such prepardness will encourage
war. and that the means to insure
against future conflicts is to avoid
armaments.

Those who spoke generally con-
ceded that there are other nations
in the world with greater arma-
ments than the United States, but
those opposed to military training
declared that this nation is in no
danger of attack, and should not in-
crease its prepardness by compul-
sory training.

The discussion wandered from di-
rectly local consideration of the
subject, and centered rather about
the proposition of military training
and prepardness in general.

PHI PSIS ARE

GREEK HOSTS

Interfraternity Council Holds
Second Dinner Under

• New Plan

Dinner will be served at the Phi
Psi house to the presidents of ail frat-
ernities tomorrow night, preceding the
meeting of the Interfraternity council.

Under the plan which has been
adopted by the council, each meeting
will be preceded by a dinner served to
the fraternity representatives. The
first meeting of this kind was held at
the Delta Kappa Epsilon house, and
Beta Theta Pi will be hosts at the
next gathering.

Install New Regime

With the reorganization of the
council last quarter, each representa-
tive, who had been chosen from the
chapter at large, was recalled, and the
council was compiled of the presidents
of the chapters, with a Junior member
of the fraternity as alternate.

Stress Inter-Greek Cc diality

“The goal at which we aimed some
years ago has been attained.” said Le-
land Neff, secretary. “We then desired
to regulate rushing and pledging so
that there would be no difficulty, and
that has been done. Our new purpose
is to bring the fraternities together in
a social way, and that can be done by
having interfraternity dinners, smok-
ers, and parties.”

All Senior members of the council
are asked to be at the Phi Psi house
for 6:15 dinner. The Junior delegates
will attend the meeting at the regular
time.

CLASS OFFICERS TO
DISCUSS ACTIVITIES

With the object of determining the
year’s social program of the three up-
per classes, there will be a meeting
of the presidents and vice-presidents
of the Senior, Junior and Sophomore
classes next Friday noon in the office
of Mrs. Merrill, director of social ac-
tivities.

The Junior class council will meet
today at 3:30 in Cobb 110 to determine
the policy of the class on this issue.
George Weimer, president of the Ju-
nior class declared that the meeting is
a very important one and urged that
all members ©f the council be present.

BOUCHER FILLS
WILKINS’ CHAIR

FOR THE WEEK

Is At Presbyterian Hospital;
Condition Is Not

Serious
-----a

Dean Ernest H. Wilkins is con-
fined at the Presbyterian hospital
as a result of overwork and though
according to his physicians his con-
dition is not critical, it is thought
that he will not be able to resume
full duties as dean of the colleges.

“I hope to resume my teaching
duties next week,” Mr. Wilkins
said last night, “but it probably will
not be possible for me to resume
my full duties as d^an.”

During Mr. Wilkins’ illness. As-
sociate Dean Chauncey S. Boucher
is taking his place and will tempor-
arily at least relieve Dean Wilkins
of some of his duties after the lat-
ter’s return.

“Mr. Wilkins is suffering from
a local disorder. In addition he is
subject to a nervous condition which
is not at all serious,” was the state-
ment given out last night by Dr.
Herman Louis Kretschmer, his
physician. “We are looking to a
speedy convalescence and his return
to work in about a week.”

This is the third year that Mr.
Wilkins has served as Dean of the
Colleges of the Arts. Literature umr
Science. Tn 1912 he was made an
associate professor at the Univer-
sity and in 1916 he became profes-
sor of Italian. He is recognized as
one of the foremost Italian scholars
in the United States.

The “Better Yet” campaigns,
priority registration and the new
science course that is being offered
now to freshmen, are some of the
things which he has accomplished
while at the head of the undergrad-
uate schools.

President Max Mason said that
the University had no official an-
nouncement to make hut that Dean
Boucher will act in capacity of Dean
this week and will in all probability
relieve Mr. Wilkins of many of his
duties after his return to the cam-
pus.

The Playfest, the proceeds of which
will be g>ven to the University Settle-
ment fund, is to be presented in Man-
del hall February 5.

Students interested in scenery and
costuming are especially invited to
participate, as these two departments
are to be given even more attention
this year than in the past.

Leaders in the Dramatic association
promise that the annual benefit per-
formance will be a true festival of en-
t rtainment. The program will include
three one-act plays, written by cam-
pus dramatists.

Capt. Hobscheid featured with some
