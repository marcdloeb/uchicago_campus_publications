First Annual Mirror:
Dear Campus Friends:

Where are we going? That is
something the University women

long time. Perhaps the men have,
too. Anyway, Mirror makes its
first appearance—its very first ap-
pearance—in Mandel hall. Friday
and Saturday, March 5 and 6.

In the Mirror’s reflections you
will see the college girl. We want
her to tell you all about it. We
think she will. Miss Marianne Dur-
brow, recently of the Bohn ballet,
is directing the features, introduc-
ing musical numbers composed ex-
clusively for Mirror.

Marie Lewis’ eleven piece orchestra,
which is composed of wind and string
instruments, will play some selections
from Mirror’s repertoire.

Asher’s theaters, including the
Frolic and other south side theatres,

University Prof.

Cast as Lead in

Morality Drama

Mr. Davis Edwards, Professor of
Public Speaking in the Divinity
School of the University and in the
Chicago Theological Seminary, has
been given the leading role in Ev-
eryman, the old morality play to be
produced by the Repertory Company
of the Goodman Theatre. Opening
Thursday, March 4th, the play will
run through at least three weeks of
the Lenten season on Thursday, Fri-
day, and Saturday nights, and Friday
and Sunday matines, the Sunday
matinees continuing indefinitely.

Well known here and in the East
for his dramatic readings which have
won warm commendation from the
press and public of both sections, Mr.
Edwards distinguishes himstlf as an
actor, and he is especially suited to
his present role because of his voice,
which attains easily the rich, musical
quality required in the play.

Directed by Mr. Redmond Flood,
formerly of the Ben Green Players,
first producers of Everyman in Amer-
ica, and supported by the able cast
of the Goodman Company, the play
will be of special interest to students.

NOMINATESTONE AND

Bill Hahn Plays
At Junior Mixer

In Reynolds Club

Bill Hahn and his College crew
will furnish the music for an all-uni-
versity mixer from 4 to 6 in the Rey-
nolds club today.

This mixer is one of a series that
the junior class is giving in its cam-
paign to increase the acquaintance-
ship and good feeling of the mem-
bers of the Junior class and the Uni-
versity as a whole* .

The affair is sponsored by the
Junior class council, of which Ellen
McCracken is Pro Tern president.

The council decided to hold the
mixer today even though it conflicts
with Mirror practice when it was
found that the Freshman class mix-
er last Friday was a success. Re-
freshments will be served.

The council members declare that
as it is University custom for such
affairs to be informal it is hoped that
campus women will come without es-
corts.

HILTONCHAPEL

OPENS MONDAY

New Theological Building
Added To Group

The Thorndike Hilton Memorial
chapel, one of the group of new
buildings planned by the theological
seminary will be ready for occupancy
March 1, according to a statement
issued by the Seminary. The chapel
is the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Henry
II. Hilton, in memory of their son,
who hope by making it the sanctuary
of the devotional life of the seminary
and neighborhood to establish a pe-
culiarly appropriate memorial to
him.

Services will be held at five in the
evening daily with appropriate lit-
urgies and brief addresses. The
chapel will be open from nine in the
morning until the time of the serv-
ices for those who desire reflection
and communion. Through the har-
monies of form and color every
means has been used to make the
interior of the building an inspira-
tion, according to Ozora Davis, pres-
ident of the seminary.

CONSIDER PROPOSED

PLAN OF THIRD YEAR

RUSHING FOR CLUBS

Whether or not club rushing
should be deferred until the third
year of a woman’s college career
will be discussed at an open council
meeting of Federation, Tuesday from
7 to 8 in the library of Ida Noyes
hall. Such a plan is now under con-
struction. All women of the Uni-
versity have been urged to come, as
a general opinion on the subject is
desired.

A committee, representative of
both faculty and student body has
been at work since last fall on the
subject.

“One recognized advantage of the
proposed plan,” said Eleanor Rice,
chairman of the Federation council,

TEN CHAIRMEN
CHOSEN; START

WORK AT ONCE

Committee Heads Meet To-
day To Formulate

Working Plans

Ten committee chairmen have
been appointed by Henry Sackett,
head of the interscholastic basketball
tournament to be held March 30 to
April 3, to handle all the details of
the meet in cooperation with him.

The ten men selected and their re-
spective committees are as follows:
James Webster, Housing; James Cu-
sack, Rushing; Charles Cowan, Re-
ception; Edward Noyes, Entertain-
ment; Joe Gubbins, Announcements;
Walter G. Williamson, Campus Pub-
licity; Reese Price, Press; Walter
Marks, Transportation; Gifford Hitz,
Program Editor; Milton Kreines,
Program business manager, and John
McDonough, Decorations.

Assemble Players

The purpose of the interscholastic
is to gather within the quadrangles
the best basketball teams of the
country, to house and entertain the
players, and to try to get some of
them interested in the University,
to acquaint them With the opportur
ities and advantages offered here.
Teams that have visited here in the
past have received a most cordial
welcome with the result that many
of them chose to remain here.

It is the work of the housing com-
mittee to locate the teams in frat-
ernity houses that are large enough
to accommodate them comfortably.
All the fraternity hosts should co-
operate with the entertainment com-
mittee to provide for amusement for
the players all the time they are not
otherwise occupied.

Committees Meet Today

The committees will all meet for
lunch today at noon in Hutchinson
Commons. At this time they will dis-
cuss all arrangements relative to the
interscholastic and will probably ap-
point sub-chairmen of the commit-
tees. Fritz Crisler will give a talk
about ways of inducing students to
come to the University.

With the final selection of chair-
men and committeemen, work in the
Interscholastic can be started. Plans
are to be formulated which will start
the interscholastic into full swing.

The Interscholastic officials last year
reported that teams were entered from
over two-thirds of the states. The
present managers base their prediction
of a successful tournament upon this
precedent.

in the Reynolds club. The name that

WHEELS

/COLLEGE, without doubt, is too much of a machine. We lose
^ sight of learning (or are in danger of losing sight of it) in a sys-
tematic chaos of reading-reports, attendance-records, course-books,
and grade-curves. We are over-organized. We do things on sched-
ule; and in underscoring schedule we almost cross out do. Our in-
struments are getting the better of us.

The remedy, many critics tell us, is easy. Remove the ma-
chinery, they cry; then the problem can be handled. Abolish grades;
let us attend lectures or not, as we please; let nothing be com-
pulsory. Let alma mater cease to be a governess.

These are reasonable measures. They would by no means
work the havoc that many officials fear. Seniors at Harvard are
not required to attend chapel, nor to take military drill, nor to an-
swer to a class roll-call; and the Harvard seniors, so far as we can
learn, still view life soundly and play their part well.

But are these reforms the real need? Does it matter much
whether chapel—and lecture—attendance are compulsory or not,
so long as chapel and lectures remain what they are? The real
question is not, Shall there be a grade-curve? but. What shall we
learn?

We are told that

Williams was old Williams

When Amherst was a pup;

And Williams will be Williams
When Amherst has grown up.

So Chicago will be Chicago, even though we be required to
prepare reading-reports on an adding machine; and Chicago will
still be Chicago, though the bureau of records be guillotined on
Ellis avenue, while a student mass-meeting chants the Marseillaise.
If a professor stimulates his pupils, it makes little difference whether
he calls the roll or not. If a chapel service has a real religious mean-
ing, we do not shake our heads and ask, “Compulsory?”

To some extent this machinery helps us. Grade-points, read-
ing-reports, and schedules are a part of the language we speak. To
get along without them would require an effort, and a waste of
energy. Society demands some routine. We must organize even
to get rid of organization.

To some extent the machinery defeats its purpose, and robs
us. We are tempted to think of knowledge, of life, of reality itself,
in terms of major and minor sequences. We become literal. Truth
becomes a matter of question and answer, of induction and syl-
logism.

This worship of form has its effect even on our bolder spirits.
The critics of the machine still revere it. The machine, they con-
tend, must no longer be a god; therefore it must be a devil. Against
course-books, blackboards, and library-fines, we must make holy
war. These things are the arch-evil; we must stamp them out.

Routine is no arch-evil, any more than it is a supreme good.
It is a tool, to be used where it can help, to be ignored where it may
hinder. Just where it can help, and where hinder, are questions that
we may leave to wise officials—officials with determination in their
lips, but an occasional twinkle in their eyes. The real problem is
elsewhere.

Lectures that invite us to study and achieve; problems that
demand hard and honest work; life presented in its awful reality—
college must give us these things. To many, the University gives
them. To many, she does not. There is the problem. There let
our critics attack.

(This is not the end of an editorial; it is the beginning of one.
Any diligent reader knows that, already. Where is this fault, we
mgiht ask; where is the weakness that holds the universities back
from their real job of inspiration? And having found the flaw,
what shall we do with it? That editorial-—or rather, those editorials
—we shall not write today.)

By John Patrick Howe

“The young people of today regard
college as a Cook’s tour of the his-
torical regions of education.” Pro-
fessor Linn, in the current edition of
the Phoenix, adds this caustic remark
to the ever-increasing anthology of
caustic remarks about students. The
obvious answer to these professorial
epigrams is simple enough: “You
made the system. If college students
are intellectual weaklings you had bet-
ter do something to improve the pro-
cess of educating them.”

Fortunately, responsible educators
are not content merely to lampoon
the products of their own classroom-.
They realize that while the majority
of college students have a passive,
even a defensive attitude toward their
studies the situation is not altogether
hopeless. The tutorial system, the
honors course system and the com-
prehensive examination systems re-
cently inaugurated at various eastern
colleges are designed to remedy this
evil and to make education a personal
matter, dependent upon the initiative
of the student.

Particularly noteworthy is the pre-
ceptorial or tutorial system now in
force at Harvard, Princeton, Bowdoin
and other eastern institutions. Oxford
furnished the model. Its purpose is
to stimulate student initiative in study-
ing and to give everyone individual at-
tention by bringing students into in-

timate contact

At Harvard
tensively used.

with faculty members.

the system is not ex-
Every week each stu-

dent is given half an hour individual
attention by one of the faculty tutors,
who thrashes out his problems with
him, makes suggestions about study-
ing, guides him in reading and tries
to instill enthusiasm into him. Inso-
far as it has been used it is an
acknowledged success.

At Princeton the theory is carried
out more fully. Classes which form-
erly met three times a week now meet
only twice, the third hour being de-
voted to conferences. Each class is
divided into conference groups. Each
group numbers from four to seven
men. They meet in the room of the

preceptor or tutor once a week for
each course and discuss the subject in
the manner of a conversation rather
than in the manner of a class. To
encourage intimacy smoking is per-
mitted and tea is sometimes served.
Conversation is general, each student
discussing his own difficulties, report-
ing on his special study, airing his
own theories and criticising those of
his neighbors. The preceptor guides
the flow of conversation, gives addi-
tional factual material and makes sug-
gestions as to advanced reading.

The preceptorial system is effective,
it works. There is a saying that
“Princeton men know how to solve
problems.” The reason that it has not
been more widely accepted as the
standard system for American colleges
is that the cost is almost prohibitive.
Even Princeton, wealthy as it is, is
faced with the alternative of reducing
the scope of the system or hiring pre-
ceptors who are younger and less dif-
ficult than the present staff.

At any rate the movement is a step
forward. It is probable that in the
near future other schools will adopt
some feasible form of the system, at
least for such departments as those
included in the social science group.

Tonight at 10:30 the Maroon
clad basketeers depart from the La-
Salle Street station, looking forward
to their engagement with the Hawk
quintet on the following evening.
Five hundred miles of speculation
ahead of them—fourteen hours of in-
activity.

Return Tilt

When the opening whistle is
blown, the locals will jump into the
game with all faculties alert to de-
feat their former victors. The lowans
who defeated the Norgrenites in the
opener of the season, enter the game
with the dope behind them; but the
surprise making Maroons may pull
out another Big Ten victory before
the evening is over.

They have won five and lost four
tilts thus far, while the Maroons
have done just the opposite. The lo-
cals will attempt to make their rating
.500 while the Hawkeye five are
hoping for a win to make it four
straight and a chance for a Confer-
ence championship. After their
initial win over the locals, they fell
into a slump and lost three straight.
Then they recovered and are now
playing in top form.

Van Deusen Star

Van Deusen, star of the Jowa
squad, is expected to come through
with his quota of markers and Cap-
tain McConnell, with his long arms
and lanky form, will perform at his
post of left guard with his usual
agility. Another man who the Nor-
grenites fear especially is Phillips,
a substitute forward, who won the
game against them in the initial con-
test in the last few minutes of play.

Alyea, Zimmerman and Sackett
will probably perform for the Ma-
roons. Their Style has greatly im-
proved in the last few tilts, although
they did seem to nave a let down
in the Illinois game. McDonough and
Hoerger will be at guard and their
performance at these positions is
known wherever Conference basket-
ball is known. Chicago has won one
game from each team so far and
lost one. May it keep its record in-
tact!

By Victor Roterus

When, on next Wednesday even-
ing, Coach Harold Taylor’s North-
men will have completed their bas-
ketball game, for better or worse,
with Norgren’s doughty Maroons,
and will have settled themselves
comfortably, or otherwise, in the
sleeper of some ^rain bound 'for
Minneapolis they will have traversed
some 8,000 miles of area during the
course of the present hoop season.

This, it is averred, exceeds by
hundreds of miles the mileage con-
sumed by any other Big Ten athletic
group. During their ambitious nego-
tiating the Gophers have also been
forced to spend twenty-two nights
away from the classroom, the library,
the laboratory and the campus in
general.

Speakers and less-daring expound-
ers, namely writers, have sawed con-
siderable air and consumed much
space in pointing out the education-
al advantages of travel. Coach Tay-
lor would not work himself into a
heat in contesting this argument, but
as for the effect of travel on a win-
ning basketball team he could rise
to the heights of eloquency. For, so
far, the Northerners have lost every
game played on a foreign floor, and
the games have numbered five.

The trouble is, Taylor explains,
that the boys composing the quintet
are of the home loving kind, unused
to the exacting exigencies of a low-
er or upper berth. They are nearly
all Minneapolis youths who, while in
high school, merely boarded a street-
car to fulfill an athletic engagement
with another institutions.

GYMNASTS ENGAGE

WISCONSIN TURNERS

MADISON, Feb. 26.—University of
Wisconsin gymnasts will meet a real
test on Saturday when they clash with
the team of the University. The Bad-
gers have been weakened greatly by
the loss of their captain, Huxley, but
have some solace in the work of a new
comer, Beckley.

The latter performed superbly at
Minnesota last week winning first in
the rings, parallel bars, and tumbling
events. The Maroons have a finely
balanced squad and will force the
remnants of the Cardinal’s tumblers
and swingers to the limits to win.
Purdue has taken the measure of both
teams but their margin over the Mid-
way team was by a meagre margin of
twenty pointe.

The women’s Sophomore swim-
ming team won the inter-class meet
held Wednesday, Feb. 24, with a
total score of 31 1-2 points. The
Seniors were next with 29 points,
the Freshmen third with 28, and the
Juniors last with 19 1-2.

The events went off as follows:
Plunge, Sophomores, first, Seniors
second, Freshmen and Juniors tied
for third; Breast Stroke (for form):
Seniors first, Freshmen and Sopho-
mores tied for second, Junior.®
fourth; 20 Yard Dash (free style),
Seniors first, Sophomores second,
Freshmen third, Juniors fourth;
Trudgeon (for form), Sophomores:
and Juniors tied for first, Freshmen
and Seniors tied for third; 40 Yard
Breast Stroke, Seniors first, Fresh-
men second, Sophomores third, Ju-
niors fourth; Diving: Freshmen first,
Juniors, second, Seniors third, Soph-
omores, fourth.

Although they put up a game fight,
the Greenwood cage team went down
to defeat 20 to 15 before Green in
an exciting contest Wednesday, Feb.
24. This makes Green sure of the
inter-hall championship, which they
have also held for the past two years.
They have not lost a game yet and
will play their last one next Wednes-
day when the finals are to be run
off. Greenwood and Drexel are tied
for second place, and Kelly is at the
end.

Maroon Trackmen

Leave for Urbana

Early tomorrow morning the
track team sets out for Champaign
to try and add a few extra laurels
to their many former victories, or
in other words to cop off a few
points at the Illini relay carnival.
The make-up of the aggregation
which will make the trip is still in
doubt but it is probable that only
the relay team and the star runners
will go.

Captain Jim Cusack will go along
to try to repeat his last year’s
triumph in the mile run, Anton
Burg will be taken and counted on
to win points and Hobscheid and
several others will no doubt he
given a chance to show what they
can do before the big relay crowds.
For those who will want to see the
men off, the information that they
leave on the Illinois Central has
been given out.

WHAT of IT?

^Sg^MORgENSTER^

I received a letter the other day [
whose significance is so far-reaching ।
that I think it ought to be divulged |
to the world at large. “Your col-
umn,” it said tersely, “would be
greatly improved if for a change you
would get away from the one subject
you seem to write on exclusively. I
have indicated that subject in pencil
on the column I am inclosing.” There
this anonymous well-wisher had
drawn neat little circles around all
the “I’s” in my column. There were
no less than twenty-one of them.
Here was matter for consideration.

My customary ease of mind was
further disturbed when some time
later I met one of my acquaintances.
“Yo ushould be at Illinois,” he greet-
ed me, “for you are the biggest T”
man in history.” That was a medn
dig. I also got another letter in the
second post touching upon this very
matter. “I counted thirty-two “I’s”
in your column this morning,” read
this second message. “Undoubtedly,
you and Heywood Broun are the two
most conceited columnists on earth.”
That was a little better. Me and
Heywood........... Heywood and I.
H-mmm, that sounded quite well.
Classing me with old Hey. Heywood
and I. H-mmm, it rolls well on the
tongue, I thought.

But still, the accusation that I was
too egotistical troubled me. It grat-
ed, I may as well admit. But on ma-
ture recollection, I decided that it

Smith Perform

An eleventh hour treat has been
afforded the University of Chicago.
Tom Eck, veteran track coach, an-
nounced today that the former wom-
an’s world championship relay team
will put on an exhibition and at-
tempt to shatter the existing wom-
an’s record in the 220 relay event.
The flying ladies will perform in con-
nection with the Intramural Athletic
Carnival on Thursday evening,
March 4.

Many Feature*

This announcement tops off a long
list of feature events that are in
store for the University and assures
the fact that the biggest evening in
Chicago’s athletic calendar will be
Thursday, March 4th. The final com-
pilation of the list of events show
that forty-eight different numbers
will be staged on the Carnival night
between the hours of seven and
eleven.

The girls will take part three
events during the evening. Miss
Helen Filkey, holder of five world’s
records, will run an exhibition high
hurdle race in an attempt to break
her own record, Miss Nellie Todd
will do likewise in the low hurdle
race, and the Chicago relay team
composed of the Misses Nellie Todd,
Norma Zilk, Dorothy Smith, and
Helen Filkey will run a 220 yard
relay. Last week in the Madisoh
Square Garden in New York City
girls established a new record of
28 3-5 in the furlong event and the
Chicago girls are all set to snatch the
record away from the Gotham speed-
sters.

Aesthetic Attractions

For the benefit of the blue bloods
who may fear that the evening will
be too athletic in its scope for their
understanding and subsequent appre-
ciation, an attractive list of aesthetic
numbers is included in the roster.
John Howe, in charge of special
numbers, announced that there will
be two Charleston features and a
soft shoe dancing exhibition, a tumb-
ling act and several engagements
with the foils between members of
the fencing team.

Initial lank Win

Looking forward to the Boilermak-

er struggle of Saturday evening, the
Maroon mermen are living in the
water this week in hopes of coping
with the strength of Dithmer and
Davenport. After tasting of the bitter
wine of despair, victory hovers over
both teams urging each to do their
utmost. The local splashers have
been vanquished thrice, making the
count even with the boys from Pur-
due, who have the same number of
defeats to their credit.

Settle Grudges

Friendly grudges are to be settled
in the coming meet, for several of
the Chicago swimmers have vowed
beating their team-mates. Karl Myg-
dal has been outdone by the veteran
Diamond and has decided to attach a
few wins to his already long string of
laurels, while Eddy Fellinger has pro-
mised Tudor Wilder some brotherly
competition.

Ed. Noyes is considered as the main
threat in the coming water fray and
has an excellent chance of annexing
points in the forty and hundred yard
affairs as well as in the relay team.

’Leichtle, who is backing the La |
Fayetters in three events, will do most
harm to the local men in the back-
stroke event, where Jelinek is defend-
ing the home talent.

Lane and Greenberg have been test-
ing their lung power this past week
and are ready to give Davenport the
opportunity to use his sprinting
powers which have won him a name
in the four hundred and forty yard
event.

PHI KAPPA SIGMA

Delts Wins From Kappa Sig
Aggregation By Score

of 14-7

Springing the biggest upset of the
present tourney, Phi Sigma Delta de-
feated Phi Kappa Sigma by a close
score of 17 to 15 and thus fought its
way to the second round of the intra-
mural cage race. Delta Tau Delta also
remained in the race by out pointing
Kappa Sigma 14 to 7.

Zolla Stars

Aided by the six baskets of Zoll i
who stands out as one of the best for-
wards in the tournament the Phi Sigs
quickly gained a lead in the first half
and never relinquished it. Zolla
scored a great number of his points
by slipping behind the Phi Kap guards
and putting them in from underneath
The winners played a great floor game
and their pass work was exceptionally
fast. “Buck” O1win, giant guard for
the Phi Kaps was the offensive star of
his team. He contributed five ringers
several of which he made after drib-
। bling half the length of the floor. He
also played a nice game defensively
and retrieved the majority of the re-
bounds off the backboard.

After holding the strong Delta Tau
Delta team without a field goal during
the entire first half of the enec^.ter,
the Kappa Sig defense collapsed the
Delts a 14 to 7 win. During the first
period the Delts had possession of the
ball a great deal but they were never
able to solve the guarding tactics of
their opponents.

ering on “The Minister of the Fu-
ture.”

Although the forum on marriage
and divorce delved into such subjects
as birth control, fitness for marriage,
and morality for the masses, the
group on prohibition achieved the
most significant and striking work.

The Mission House Theological
Seminary declares that “five years
is not a long enough period in which
scientific people can judge whether
or not so drastic an action as the
eighteenth amndment is a failure.”
That institution’s report further
stressed the fact that the church was
originally responsible for prohibition
and consequently ought to support it.

Many other theological institutes
came out uncompromisingly in favor
of prohibition. Most of them based
the statute on a moral basis, al-
though some turmoil arose when
many demanded that the conference
recognize the act as of economic and
political significance.

WHAT OF IT?

(Continued from sport page)
was unfair, that the writers of them
deux billets had not an adequate
grasp of the situation. Here is the
way I reasoned it out: “I am a col-
umnist,” I thought, “A column is es-
sentially personal. It is a reflection
of personality, and only that. A col-
umnist without personal opinions
would be a total loss. To put down
personal opinions on paper, it is nec-
essary to make frequent use of the
word I’ (I believe, I think, it seems
to me, etc.) Does not Mr. James
Weber Linn, in his column “In and
about Chicago,” formerly “Just
Talking it Over,” formerly “Lights
and Darks,” formerly—but I forget
—well, does he not use the word T’
frequently, does not Heywood Broun
do not all the rest of the columnists?
The answer is obvious: it is “yes.”

So I feel justified in doing busi-
ness on the old stand, in scattering
“F^” about just as thickly as I
want. I would be no columnist wor-
thy of the name if I did not. But
I shall do it, as I always have done
(though a good many people do not
seem to think so), with an humble
and a contrite heart. I shall not be
arrogant or egotistical. I shall re-
member the good counsel of Mr.
Fred Hobscheid at the time of the
gone-but-not-forgotten Campus
Beauty Contest. “You’re only a
freshman,” said Mr. Hobscheid;
“you’re not so good. Don’t ferget it.”
I have not.

If you’ve got time, count ’em.
