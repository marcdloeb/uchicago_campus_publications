the list of composers.

Chorus Snappy

Lillie and Reid, together with George
Jones and John Wild, composed the
opening chorus medley, which is pro-

snappiest choruses in the history of
Blackfriars.

Reid is also the winner of the com-

I'm Wicked,’’ “We’re the Campus
Women,” and “Sally.” Jones and Reid

D2V0TE SUM TO

CANCER TESTS

Research In Field Given
Impetus By Gift

Cancer research at the University, I
which has been conducted with im-
portant results for many years by
Miss Maude Slye, will be enhanced
by the income from a fund of $100,-
000, a bequest of the late Edwin
Francis Holmes. The gift is an-
nounced in a letter to President Max
Mason by Miss Harriet F. Holmes,
daughter of the donor.

The four children of the donor will
have a life interest in the fund, and
when that interest ceases the $100,-
000 will revert to the University for
the establishment of the Edwin P.
Holmes Fund for Medical Research,
the letter states.

Miss Slye indicated that the
Holmes gift will greatly facilitate the
cancer research work of the Univer-
sity, and expressed gratitude to the
donor, and to his daughter for her
services.

president of the organization.

According to the tradition set by
the club, tea will be served before
Prof. Jenkin’s talk. Everyone inter-
ested in French has been invited to

introduce new and interesting facts
concerning that country,” said Alex El-
son, president of the L't^tiT club.

COUNCIL NAMES

and Graham Hagey, ’26, will lead the
Inter-Class Hop with John McDon-
ough, Parker Hall, and four women.
Alta Cundy, Elizabeth Graham, Bet-
sy Farwell, and Charlotte Eckhart.

hours, were made at a meeting of the
Undergraduate Council in Classics
yesterday afternoon, Allan Miller pre-
siding.

The date of the Hop will be settled
in a meeting of the leaders to be held
some time next week. All the plans
will be arranged at this meeting, the
work will be alloted, and the commit-

tees appointed.

The coincidence of two brothers
leading the Hop was altogether unex-
pected by most of the members of the
Council, who expressed great surprise
when the results were announced in
the meeting. Both are members of
Chi Psi.

MEADEVILLE SCHOOL
BUYS PROPERTY; TO
-MOVE HERE IN JUNE

Meadeville theological seminary
has purchased the four corners at the
intersection of 57th street and Wood-
lawn Avenue, where they are going
to erect their school in June.

The school is now located at
Meadeville, Mass. The authorities of
the seminary felt that their students
needed the advantage of a large uni-
versity where subjects other than
that of a theological nature could be
afforded. The school is not to be-
come directly affiliated with the
University because they fear they
might become engulfed by the larger
institution and they want to remain
distinctive if possible.

Meadeville students have always
come to Chicago in the summer to
work. While here they have their
classes in the Meadeville house on
Woodlawn. In the regular school
year the house is used as a rooming
and boarding place for University
students.

The new school purchased the Phi
Delta Theta house along with the ad
jacent vacant lot. The upstairs
rooms of the Phi Delt house are to
be used for a dormitory for married
men and their wives. The downstairs
rooms are to be used for class rooms
and a library. Later on, when time
and finances permit the tentative
plans call for a new building which
will be used entirely for class rooms.

Across the street, west, the house
of Dr. Femister will be used for the
home of the President of the school.
On the northwest corner of the in-
tersection the chapel of the school
will be erected.

Interfraternity Council

Will Meet Tonight

Officers for next year will be elected
at the meeting of the Inter-Fraternity
Council to be held tonight before din-
ner at 6:15 at the Phi Delta Theta
house. The Seniors will vote on Ju-
nior members of the Council only.

Revision of the rushing rules which
has occupied the Council recently wilk
be taken up for discussion

“Woodrow Wilson of the West”
Ends Deanship Amid Applause

A man sat at the head of a dinner-
table in Ida Noyes hall last night.
Teachers and pupils sat before him.
{is term of office was ended; and
Dean Ernest Hatch Wilkins, with
bowed head, heard what few men
ever hear—praise, applause, and
thanks from those with whom he
worked.

One by one his colleagues—in col-
lege and in faculty—spoke.

“The Woodrow Wilson of the
West,” Prof. T. V. Smith called him.
“He is a poet although he may never
have written a verse. All of Wilkins’
work has been characterized by the
symmetry and beauty which mark
that of the artist. Had somebody de-
scribed Dean Wilkins to me before
I knew him, I, as a philosopher,
should have said, ‘There cannot be
such a man.’ ” “He is a perfect ma-
chine, a beautifully working system,
but more,— he is a man.”

BROADCAST MANDEL
HALL SERVICE FROM

RADIO STATION WLS

Beginning next Sunday at 11:00 a.
m., the Sunday services held at Man-
del hall will be broadcasted every week
over WLS, the Sears Roebuck station
at the Sherman Hotel. John Van Zant
director of the university radio station
has succeeded in bringing about the
arrangement, by negotiating with Di-
rector Edgar L. Ball, of WLS, and
the Faculty Radio Committee, of

which Dean Laing is chairman.

Bernard I. Bell, president of St.
Stephens College, Anadale-on-Hudson,
New York, has been obtained as speak-
er on next Sunday’s program. The
services will also include renditions
of hymns and anthems by the univer-
sity choir and an opening score by
the university chimes.

Church services up to the present
time have been a source of pleasure

and comfort to radio owners who were
not able to get to church. Every ef-
fort has been made to make these
services as attractive as possible, and
the best speakers as well as other
attractions, will be afforded to those
who are interested in the services and
who are not able to leave their homes.

A SMALLER TRIBUTE

qpo what stages of deep, blue-jowled pessimism are college
people lowerJhg when they boldly and unblinkingly assert
that “the one great truth is that life is largely a sordid, dull thing,
and must be accepted as such," and "the business of the race is
nine-tenths drudgery."

Those who have washed their hands of college tell us that
this is but typical undergruatitius—a diseaes intensely infec-
tious when a sound undergraduate mind is exposed to too much
Schopenhauer or Nietzsche. I often wonder if they are not just
about right.

Al Kettler

DIGRESSION UPON THE SAME THEME

XX TE said, in an editorial yesterday, the things that this correspond-
" ’ ent atcuses us of sayifig. Except that our words were “one
great truth" and not "THE one great truth”, he quotes us correct-
ly. Nevertheless, we deny being pessimists.

There is nothing startling, we believe, about the statement that
life contains many elements that are dull and uninteresting. Before
one can achieve things in business, one must start out, usually, as a
clerk or a bookkeeper. Before one can become a great surgeon,
one must study bothersome details of anatomy. There are verbs
to conjugate before we can drink of Plato's wisdom or admire the
Lucretian cleverness. There are formulae and equations to puzzle
over, before we are ready to discover new stars in the sky. And
before one man can take a single magnificent stride, a dozen must
devote their lives to routine.

To observe this fact is not to be a pessimist—unless observing it
we lose our temper. To deny this fact, to insist that life is
one triumphant advance, is to be a Napoleon—or else a Darius
Green. We might as well acknowledge that there is work to do,
that most of it is far from interesting, and that we are elected to
do it.

Then, if we say no more but go to our tasks, we may find a
strange value in this dreaded drudgery. We may find that routine
honestly followed, and not battles won by storm, makes men of us.

Social Sphere

By Alta Cundy

Commerce and administration,
heretofore strangers in this sphere of
pleasure, gain admittance as hosts
for one of the season’s gayest festiv-
ities, the banquet of the C. and A.
school. For fifteen years this school
has maintained the custom of giving
a spring banquet for its associates.

Friday night marks the banquet of
1926. It is to be given at the Hyde
Park Hotel and is to include as its j
guests or honor, President and Mrs.
Max Mason, Vice-President and Mrs.
F. C. Woodward, Professor and Mrs.
L. C. Marshall, Mr. Frank O’Hara,
Mr. John Logan, President of the
Alumni of the Commerce and Ad-
Vnlnistration school, and Dean and
Mrs. William H. Spencer. Mr. A. C.
Hodge will act as toastmaster and
will be introduced by Mr. C. E.
Hayes, President of the C. and A.
Student Council. The new officers,
elected by that school today, will be
introduced to the guests. Dancing is
to follow the dinner.

Clubs and fraternities have chosen
this waaiwsnd for house dances, and

chapter parties. On Friday evening
we find Alpha Sigma Phi and Delta
Upsilon have issued invitations to
their first spring house dance. Psi
Upsilon has also entered a party for
that evening on this week’s calendar
and have invited Mr. and Mrs. H. C.
Willett as their guests of honor.

The College club has been chosen
by the Quadranglers for their first
Spring party. Mr. and Mrs. John
Logan are guests of the chapter that
evening.

The International club finds Friday
evening and Ida Noyes hall appropri-
ate in time and place for their Spring
soecial meeting.

Saturday varies its program from
a duo-fraternity party, and a schol-
arship dance to the house and pledge
dance. #

The first of these, the duo-frater-
nity party, invites guests to a dance
and supper given by the active
chapters of Alpha Delta Phi and
Phi Kappa Psi. The latter’s house
will be the first to entertain as the
dancing has been scheduled there,
while the guests will later enjoy the
hospitality of the other fraternity by
attending supper at their house. Mr.
and Mrs. James R. Mulroy, Mr. and

Hope for Huge Entry List
In Spring’s Most

Liked Sport

Another intramural sport for this
spring has been planned for and ar-
rangements are being made to start
play on the most popular of spring
sports in the number of individual
contestants—4ennis.

Many Entered

Last year over two hundred entered
the singles event in this sport, and al-
most every fraternity was represented
in the doubles tourney. Play is to be
conducted in the same way this year,
and all entries must be in the hands
of the Intramural department by
April 23. which is one week from Fri-
day.

Gordon Wallace, who managed these
events so successfully last year, has
been put in charge again this season.
He replaces Gordon Stillson as man-
ager of tennis. Koerber and Widman
will assist Wallace in running the
tournaments.

Secure Four Courts

Four of the! University courts have
been secured for the exclusive use of
the Intramural department to assure
convenient access to them at all times.
These courts are located across the
Midway, at Sixtieth Street, near Kim-
bark Avenue. Play is to begin on the
26th of April, if the weather permits.

Silver loving cups will be presented
to the team winning the doubles
tournament and to the champion of
the singles event. Shapinsky. one of
the leading candidates for this year's
^rsity squad, won the University
championship last spring, when he de-
feated Chuck Cowan in a close match.
Zeta Beta Tau. represented by Kemp-
ner and Schcar, took first honors in
the doubles event.

Offer Prizes

Gold, silver, and bronze medallettes
are offered to the individual players
who are the winners or runners-up in
each of the events. These incentives
are not needed, however, to get com-
petitors in this popular sport. The
fyn of playing the game is expected
to get the contestants to sign up for
these events, and swell the entry lists
again this year.

According to John Howe, manager
of Spring Sports, games in play-
ground ball will begin next Wednes-
day afternoon. These will be the first
contests to take place under the spring
program.

Red Krogh Elected
Wrestling Captain

“Red’*' Krogh was elected next
year’s wrestling captain at a ban-
quet held last evening at Hutchin-
son Commons. After the dinner,
several men spoke and the opinion
■was expressed that the Maroon
squad of next season will put up
a strong fight for the Conference
championship.

Krogh was elected almost unan-
imously. With the addition of the
strong freshman team of this last
season to the team, it should pre-
sent a very powerful and we »-
balanced group.

The coach expressed the idea
that he was pleased with the work
and co-operation of the men this
year and hoped that it would con-
tinue to improve next year. He is
a member of Kappa Sigma fra-
ternity. He won the Conference
175-pound title last season.

Fiction is never supposed to have

is, nevertheless, always being dragged

This weakness has apparently struck I
Chicago, for this spring much is be-;
ing heard around the campus about i

Will Page Lead the

Since Pat Page, former Maroon
coach and athlete, has gone to In-
diana University as head football
coach, much interest has been di-
rected toward Hoosier hopes on
the gridiron next fall, and Big Ten
fans are already wondering how
Page will fare in his initial ap-
ptirance as a Western Conference
gridiron mentor.

No one knows just how success-
ful he will be in attempting to
place the Hoosiers on the football
map, but some idea of what he is
doing can be had from the reports
of spring football practice, which
he is conducting at Indiana U. The
Indiana Daily Student says of
this, “A determined atmosphere
prevails at the workouts, and the
result is an earnestness that bodes
well for next year’s team.”

A squad of seventy men, which
reaches maximum expectations, is list-
ed for reporting at the daily spring
football sessions. Seventy are listed,
but, as yet. no s;,’glc turn-out has
numbered that much; the usual turn-
out numbering about fifty.

Ten Letter Men

Hardly any of the lettermen of last
fall’s team have reported as they are
engaged in other sports, baseball and
track occupying their time. The
spring football season is conducted
chiefly with the view of instilling the
fundamentals into the players, so the
veterans have little necessity^for at-
tending the sessions.

'The average weight of the squad
now reporting for practice hovers
around the 170 pound mark, but this
means practically nothing as a num-
ber of light-weights, who will not be
retained next fall tend to pull the aver-
age down. Most of the real poundage
of the present squad is distributed
among the men who were members
of last year’s squad. These men are
S. Rouse, Lewis, Johnson, Priess, Rys-
son, Bloom, Olwin, Cochrane, Clark,
Heitman, Apitz, Fulton and Cameron.

Yesterday’s practice was similar to
the others held before. There was a
great deal of passing and handling of
the ball, some practice on fundamen-
tals such as tackling and falling on
the pigskin.

By name they are Frey, Williams,'
and Burke, and by reputation they
are the three most phenomenal frosh
tracksters that the University has •
ever seen. And what they have done
already this year has backed up these;
reputations very nicely.

Frey is an all-around performer (
but does his best in the high jump.
He consistently jumps over five feet1
ten, and at least once this season has j
cleared the bar at six feet and one
quarter inch, which would, undoubt-1

edly, have placed hird in the indoor
conference this year. Also he slings
a mean discus and is said to be able
to turn in similar performances in
several other events.

Star Miler

Williams is a star miler and dis-
tance runner. iHs fastest this year
in his specialty has been 4:26*4 on
the track at Bartlett, which is very
excellent time. He also reels the
half-mile off around two minutes and
can always be counted on to do un-
der ten in the two-mile. He will be
remembered by sports fans as the
boy that finished second only to Joie
Ray in the Tribune’s cross-country
race last fall.

Burke, the third of Lonnie Stagg’s
Three Musketeers, is Williams’ team-
mate in the mile, and they are still

battling for supremacy. His best time
in the mile is 4:27 3-5, but in the

The purpose of the party will be to

at the time when the club published
booklets containing the Tarpon tests.

The tickets for the affair are fifty
cents and may be procured from any
member of the club. All Tarponites
have been asked to dispose of at least
one ticket each, and to turn all money
over to the president by Friday.

half he has turned in a clocking of
1:58 3-4 and he also does the two-
mile grind in less than ten minutes.

Thus track hopes for next season
are decidedly bright and the way the
figures stand, Iowa will be the Ma-
roon’s only competitor for next con-
ference championship.

A Timely Guarantee

BY HARRY L. SHLAES
(Sport* Editor)

After jumping into a substantial
lead and holding it for three innings,
the Maroon diamond squad fell to
pieces and was beaten, 12-5, by the
Purple at Ferry Field yesterday aft-
ernoon. Chicago batted out four runs
in the first inning and then fell
through in both offense and defense.
After that lone tally in the third
frame, the locals were blanked inn-
ing after inning, while the North
Shore boys were piling up an over-
whelming lead, breaking through
three Maroon pitchers.

Break Through

On an error by Brignall, the Pur-
ple began its strong scoring in the
second frame and forced three runs

across the pan. They followed up
with one in the sixth and three more
in the seventh before taking a rest,
pulling their total up to twelve.

On account of the cold weather the
playing was ragged on -both sides,
many errors being made in both the
field and on the bases. There were

only two hits clouted out which
were good for more than a single
base. Both of them were triples, one
by Christman and one by Feidel, both
members of the Northwestern team.

Maroon* Use Many Hurlers

The Midwayites used three pitch-
ers in trying to stem the tide, but all
three of them were battered unmerci-
fully. Gubbins, minute Maroon
leader, started the game and lasted
pretty well until the big fourth for
the Wildcats, when Wallie Marks,
who had been playing out in right
field, came in and took his place.
Macklind hurled the eighth inning.
The only time the Maroons threat-
ened was in the first few frames,
when Palmer, who began the game
for the Purple, was in distress.

A soldier of the Russians
Lay japanned at Tschrtzvkskivitch
There was lack of woman’s nursing
And other comforts which
Might add to his last moments
And smooth the final way;—
But a comrade stood beside him
To hear what he might say.
The japanned Russian faltered
As he took that comrade’s hand,
And he said: “I never more shall see
My own, my native land;
Take a message and a token
To some distant friends of mine,
For I was born at Smnxzrskgqrxski,

Camelt contain the very choicest tobaccos grown in all the
world. Camels are blended by the world’s most expert
blenders. Nothing is too good for Camels. In the making
of this one brand we concentrate the tobacco knowledge and
skill of the largest organization of tobacco experts in the
world. No other cigarette made is like Camels. They are
the overwhelming choice of experienced smokers.

Camels never tire your

those in Camels.

road curves through the
colonnades of birches—
have then the finest made,
regardless of price.

Servants of the Public

Because our railroads are public utilities, rendering a
service without which our civilization could not exist,
railway employes take a pride ih their work which is
greater than that shown bv most employes in most in-
dustrial occupations. Tradition has bred in railway
workers a family spirit, a camaraderie, which lias sur-
vived the test of time. This is true not only of those
engaged in the highly specialized branches of the work
but also of those whose occupations differ little, if at
all, from work outside. To work for the railroad has
always been a badge of distinction.

The successful operation of our railroads today re-
quires the combined efforts of nearly 2,000,000 em-
ployes, or approximately one wage earner out of every
twenty in our population. On a typical railroad, how-
ever, only about one employe out of every six is engaged
in actually running trains. One in every three main-
tains the tracks, buildings and other facilities; one in
every four keeps the cars and locomotives in condition;
one in every seven is a clerk, storekeeper, janitor, watch-
man or the like; one in every nine operates freight and
passenger stations and does similar work connected with
the movement of trains; one in every hundred is an
engineering, achitectural or chemical specialist; one
in every 150 is an executive, division officer or staff
assistant.

Those employes who come in direct contact with the
public in the performance of their duties, although they
constitute only a small proportion of the whole, really
stand for the railroad in the public mind. Such em-
ployes, through their attitude toward courtesy and
efficiency, can make or break the reputation of a rail-
road and enhance or offset the work performed by the
larger groups of employes who are just as important in
the production of the service but who are stationed, so
to speak, behind the scenes.

The service purchased by railway patrons is provided
by railway employes through the use of machinery
paid for by the investment of railway owners. Both
employes and owners are rewarded out of the rates paid
by the public, but wages are paid ahead of dividends.
Employes get their money whether or not owners do.
On the other hand, through efficiency and economy in
the use of the machinery intrusted to them, as well as
by the way they win and maintain business, employes
contribute materially to such return as is earned by the
investment of owners.

When railway owners provide a plant, acquiesce in
the payment of reasonable wages and arrange for satis-
factory working conditions, their duty toward their
employes and, through them, toward the public is about
complete. From that point on, railway sendee is a mat-
ter for agreement between the railway employes and
the public, whose servants they are. That railway
employes as a whole have performed their duties loy-
ally, courteously and intelligently in the past is evi-
denced by the high standing that the railroads now
enjoy in public esteem.

Constructive criticism and suggestions are invited.
