WHAT OF
IT?

fy(^£eMw&nstefn

The Daily Illini, official organ of
the voice of the good people of
Champaign County, has started wise-
cracking again. It was more or less
inevitable. This time the college
boys of the Greatest State University
have let off steam in the form of an
“All-American” football team, which
the Twin Buroughs fellows sought to
make even more funny than “All-
American” t<*ams usually are by nam-
ing eleven of Mr. Stagg’s boys for
the places. Mr. Laurence Apitz, the
scholarly end, was not put on the
selection, Mr. Harold (Red) Grange,
formerly an Illini himself, but now
sunk even lower, and serving as a
newspaper writer for a mere hand-
ful! of silver, having named Mr.
Apitz as one of his ends on the
Grange All-Conference, released in
the Hearst sheets recently. To put
Mr. Apitz on the team, therefore,
would have obviously put either Mr.
Grange or The Daily Illini in a ques-
tionable light—a thing to be avoided.
So a fellow named “Hogan,” or
something, was put on instead.

• « * *

It is a somewhat amusing conceit,
this idea of The Illini’s, but not at
all new. If I remember rightly, it
is the same thing that was done no
later than five years ago to the Il-
lini themselves, by that great chron-
icle of the corn fields, The Daily
Iowan. Five years ago, I think it
was, was the season Mr. Zupplte’s
team took its turn at consistent los-
ing, and not only dropped all ;ts
Conference games, but another so-
called “practice” game to Butler,
just coming up out of the obscurity
of Indianapolis to a place of prestige
under Mr. Harland Orville Page, now
of Indiana. Losing all of its games
occasionally will happen to any
team—even that of the Draft Army
of the Greatest State University. The
Daily Illini, evidently, wrote its “All-
American” fully conscious of the
smug Illinois superiority, and.the Il-
lini victory over the Maroons this
fall. Yet, I point out, Mr. Zuppke’s
hoys only won 7-0 over this team
which they ridicule as so low—and
had great difficulty in doing even
that. And even if Illinois can get a
team out of its Ten Thousand sim-
ple boys, recruited from Maine to
Montana, that is occasionally able
to beat a school that draws its team
from less than two thousand, there [
oughtn’t to be such a lot of shouting I
over it.

* ♦ * *

The whole thing is again, of course
entirely typical of Illinois and. The
Daily Illini. As Mr. Zuppke said
of his team to my brother over on
Stagg Field the Friday afternoon Il-
linois was working out before the
• hicago game, “They’re just dumb
enough to make a good game of it.”
So with The Daily Illini; it’s just
dumb enough to satisfy the Ten
Thousand deadheads of the Greatest
State University.

♦ * » ♦

By the way, ‘ here’s something
dipped out of the “Illini News” col-
umn of my town paper, the Oak
Leaves, a journal as great, noble,
and funny in its own way as The
Baily Illini in its “The junior prom
is a very exclusive affair, and tickets
are sold only to juniors with the cor-
rect number of hours of credit. This
year thumb prints were made of all
those who bought tickets, in order to
check up on them at the door and
make certain that no tickets change
hands. Those on the preferred list
are names prominent in campus ac-
tivities and athletics.” Merely anoth-
er indication of the “Illinois mind”—
a thing, I am sure, which would make
a very curious study for any psy-
chologist with nothing better to en-
gage him for the time.

DEAN G. J. LAING
HURT IN WRECK;
BACK TOMORROW

Train Is Derailed on His
Return from Tour

in Canada

Returning to Chicago from To-
ronto, after having delivered a series
of lectures, Dean Gordon Jennings
Laing of the Graduate School of Arts
was injured in an accident on the
Wabash lines, Saturday, Nov. 20. He
sustained a broken rib, a torn mus-
cle in his back and a few minor in-
juries when four of the coaches on
the train were derailed. The section
in which Dean Laing was riding roll-
ed down a forty foot embankment.

While in Montreal and Toroto,
Dean Laing together with Stephen
Leacock, the humorist, had given a
series of lectures to the students at
McGill University and to the Can-
adian club and the University club
of Montreal.

Dean Laing was Dean of Arts and
Science at McGill university for two
years before coming to the Univer-
sity.

Miss Ortha Leslie Wilner, instruc-
tor in the Latin department will meet
Dean Laing’s class, Latin 385, dur-
ing his absence. Dean Laing’s con-
dition is reported to be considerably
improved and he intends to resume
duties on campus tomorrow.

Drake Introduces
New Keutzer Hit;

Lopez Lauds Song

“Just as the Day is Done,” a waltz
composed by Clyde Keutzer, Beta
Theta Pi, is fast becoming one of
the popular hits in dance circles oi
today. It was introduced by Bobby
Meeker’s Orchestra at the Drake ho-
tel last Wednesday.

Two orchestras in New York City
Vincent Lopez’ Orchestra and Leon-
ard’s Orchestra which plays at the
Waldorf Astoria hotel are featuring
the piece. Vincent Lopez said of
the song, “It is one of the best waltz
pieces I have heard in years.”

Paul Ash is going to feature Keut-
zer’s song at some time in the future.
At this time Keutzer will probably
sing the song in connection with Paul
Ash’s show.

NOVA SCOTIA PAPER
REQUESTS EXCHANGE

WITH DAILY MAROON

An indication of The Daily Ma-
roon’s widespread fame is shown by
the request of the Galhousie Ga-
zette for an exchange of publications.
Galhousie university is located at
Halifax, Nova Scotia and is the most
northern and eastern institution of
this character in America. Size and
location have not interefered with
its attainments. It has produced a
championship English rugby football
team, the third best dental school on
the continent, and a hockey team
that has “crossed sticks with Har-
vard.”

Postpone Date Of
“Un Double Aveu”

“Un Double Aveu,” written by a
modern French author, which was
scheduled for presentation today,
has been postponed for two weeks.
The play will be given at a meeting
Thursday, Dec. 16 with Irene Bas-
sett and Beatrice Watson in the cast.
Mr. John L. Balbis Jr., instructor in
French will speak at the meeting to-
day at 4:30 at the Maison Francaise,
5810 Woodlawn Avenue.

Campus Freshman
Shot By Burglar

William Bolton, 17 year old T.
K. E. pledge, who was shot in the
right thigh by a colored burglar
Tuesday afternoon, is reported by
attending physicians as doing as
well as can be expected.

Bolton was surprised by the
burglar in the Bolton home, 4308
Greenwood Avenue. The prowler
was heard moving about in the
hallway, and although Bolton had
a revolver in his hand, the burglar
first fired when he stepped into
the hallway. The man escaped
through a rear door.

Bolton was taken to the John
B. Murphy hospital by the police
immediately following the shoot-
ing in his home.

SCHILLER LAUDED
BY PROF. MOORE

---4..

German Philosopher Lectures
Today at 4:30

“Dr. Schiller, outstanding represen-
tative of pragmatic philosopny in Eu-
rope today is a vividly clear writer
and speaker. His many iectures and
literary works are all characterized
by a saving sense of humor.”

That was the tribute paid to Dr.
F. C. S. Schiller of Oxford univer-
sity, by Prof. Addison W. Moore of
the University philosophy depart-
ment. Dr. Schiller is to speak on
“William James and the Making of
Pragmatism” today at 4:30 in Har-
per M-ll. He has recently com-
pleted a tour of western colleges
where he gave similar lectures.

Dr. Schiller, now at the height
of his literary career, has contribut-
ed among his works: “Riddles of the
Saints,” “Studies in Humanism.” and
“Critique of Logic,” which he has
just recently finished. “Tantalus or
The Future of Man” is his repre-
sentative work in the “Today and To-
morrow” series.

Jane Addams To

Speak At Social
Service Banquet

Miss Jane Addams, founder of Hull
House and prominent social worker,
will speak before dinner to be given
by the Social Service club tonight at
6:30 in Ida Noyes hall. The subject
Miss Addams has chosen for her talk
is, “Recent National Conferences.”

Along with her work-in supervis-
ing Hull House, Miss Addams has
written several books. “Democratic
and Social Ethics,” “The Spirit of
Youth and the City Streets,” “Peace
and Bread in Time of War,” and
“Newer Ideals of Peace” are a few
of the titles which give an insight
into her interests. Founding Hull
House, engaging in club activities,
and taking an interest in politics
from a social standpoint, character-
ize Miss Addams’ pursuits.

SCHEDULESENIOR
DINNER FOR NEXT
FRIDAY EVENING

Allison and Graham Chair-
men of Tickets Committee;

Sell After Chapel

Tickets for the Senior Class din-
ner, to be held Friday, Dec. 10 as
the first official function of the class
will be on sale immediately at the
close of Senior chapel today. Th/y
may be obtained from all members
of the Senior Class council at seven-
ty-five cents apiece. John Allison
and Betty Graham are acting as co-
chairmen of the ticket committee.

The dinner is expected to be one
of the elaborate social affairs of the
season. Many features are being
planned to make the occasion a gala
celebration. “The festivity should
meet with enthusiastic approval as
only a few class social affairs remain
before plans of convocation and
graduation assail the Seniors,” says
John Meyer, senior class president.

Committees on arrangements are
planning on an attedance of more
than two hundred seniors. Arrange-
ments have been completed for hold-
ing the dinner in Ida Noyes hall
promptly at 6:15.

Members are urged to purchase
their tickets 'today and thus great-
ly facilitate matters and assist the
various committees.

Place Blame On

Student Driving
In Death Trial

George Smith, negro, charged with
the responsibility for the deaths of
Charles Mickelberry and William
Bohan, last winter was freed by a
jury in Judge William Lindsay’s
court. After five minutes of deliber-
ation, the foreman announced the
verdict of “not guilty!”

The case came to trial last week,
although the accident occurred last
spring when the boys were going to I
an Alpha Delta Phi dance in Oak
Park. They met Smith’s car in a
head-on collision on the outer drive
in Grant Park on June 11.

Harriet Stover, former student
here, was the only witness in the
case. The other girl who was in the
car at the time of the accident, Nat-
alie Trese, is still confined in St.
Luke’s hospital, suffering from a
broken hip bone. ।

HUGE RED CHIMNEY

HOLDS GRAB-BAG AT

Y. W. C. A. BAZAAR

“Get grabby” has been chosen by
Clair Davis and Margaret Newton,
co-chairmen of the grab bag commit-
tee, as the slogan of the Freshman
grab bag booth at the Y. W. C. A.
Christmas Bazaar, Dec. 10, in Ida
Noyes hall.

In accordance with the Christmas
spirit, a novel receptacle in the form
of a huge red and white chimney has
been chosen to help carry out this
idea. Twenty-five cents, paid to one
of the two Santa Claus attendants,
will entitle the “grabber” to one of
the various novelties to be had in the
chimney.

Harold F. Gosnell

Ill With Pleurisy

Mr. Harold Gosnell, assistant pro-
fessor in the Political Science de-
partment, who has been suffering
from pleurisy, is improving rapidly.
He was ill in his home for ten days
before he was removed to the Pres-
byterian hospital where he has been
for three weeks. Assistant Profes-
sor J. Kerwin, believes that Mr. Gos-
nell will resume his classes in about
a week.

Where Ignorance Is
Bliss, It Is Folly

Could you quote more than one
page of the Bible or Shakespeare?

According to Mr. Frank K.
Reilly, president of the Reilly and
Lee Publishing Company of Chi-
cago and head of the White Pa-
per club, in a recent address be-
fore members of Mr. Frank
O’Hara’s newswriting class, a
knowledge of these two high
points of literature is essential to
successful writing.

When Mr. O’Hara corroborated
the publisher’s belief and present-
ed the above question at a class
meeting no one volunteered an
answer. The class blinked. It ex-
pected one member at least to at-
tempt to give a quote. But there
was a complete silence.

CHINA BENEFITS
BY NATIONALISM

Yank Publisher Commends
Chinese Government

The Nationalist movement in
China, in spite of many and serious
mistakes of its leaders and adherents
is at base a wholesome development
because it is a manifestation of a
growing interest in and feeling of
responsibility for the affairs of gov-
ernment, according to Grover Clark,
editor and publisher of the Peking
China Leader, who spoke at the Uni-
versity Tuesday afternoon.

Though pointing out that “it would
be a grave mistake to overlook the
anti-foreign aspects of the nation-
alist movement,” the speaker con-
tended that “the great majority to-
day are realizing that China’s essen-
tial problem is domestic, not foreign,
and that order, stability and decent
government can be secured only by
a good deal of patient, hard spade
work in educating the people.

Campus Women At
“Y” Open House

In Reynolds Club

Campus women, for the first time
in the history of the University, will
be the guests of the Y. M. C. A. at
its open house and tea this afternoon
at 4 in the south lounge of the Rey-
nolds club. Students of Methodist i
denomination are especially invited
to attend this session and special
meeting afterward. Entertainment
will be provided by a string trio
which Edwarda Williams, violinist,
will direct.

Dr. Gilbert Cox of Woodlawn M.
E., and Rev. F. J. Schnell, of St.
James M. E., will speak at the Meth-
odist meeting and lead in a discus-
sion.

All subsequent “Y” entertain-
ments will be in the nature of group
arrangements, having always one
school organization as special guest.

You’ll Be

Interested

in the winning manuscripts and
authors of the 1927 Blackfriars’
production. The complete story
will be released in the Christmas
edition of the Daily Maroon.

This issue will not only be the larg-
est in the history of your newspaper
but it will be the best.

Read this column every day and
see why! We’re not bragging.

THE DAILY MAROON

UNIVERSITY GETS
$415,000 GIFT
FROM FINANCIER

G. H. Jones Donates Fortune
For Chemical Equipment
and Endowment

The University has received from
Mr. George Herbert Jones, director
of the Inland Steel Company, a gift
of $415,000 for the equipment and
endowment of chemistry. Plans are
already being formed by the Univer-
sity for the construction of the Geo.
Herbert Jones chemical research lab-
oratory which is to be the first unit
of new laboratories devoted to fun-
damental investigations in chemistry
and its relation to medicine and in-
dustry. Additional units will be add-
ed as funds pre contributed.

Because it provides maintenance
for one of the basic sciences upon
which the new $20,000,000 medical
program of the University has been
erected, University officials regard
the gift as extremely important both
to the Midway institution ^nd to the
city of Chicago as a medical center.
Modern chemistry bringing new and
essential discoveries in the form of
drugs, serums and the like, demands
a new and efficient type of laboratory
they say.

“Therefore,” according to Prof. Ju-
lius Stieglitz, head of the chemistry
department, “the staff and graduate
student body are happy for this re-
lease from the handicaps of the past
and present—handicaps resulting
from the fact that the present chem-
ical laboratory, a gift of the late
Sydney A. Kent and erected 1893,
could not anticipate either the rev-
olutionary progress made in chemis-
try in the last thirty years or the vast
increase in the interest in chemistry.

“When the full building program
has been completed, Kent chemical
laboratory will be used wholly for
undergraduate work and all of the
graduate work will be housed in the
new buildings. These proposed exten-
sions will also provide opportunity
for developing research fields of
chemistry not now intensively culti-
vated at the University. Such fields
are, photosynthesis, (the formation of
food products in plants with the aid
of sunlight,) metallurgy, colloid
chemistry and synthetic organic
chemistry which are of great import-
ance to progress in medicine.

“The new laboratory, provided for
so generously by Mr. Jones, will be
used exclusively for the investiga-

FILL FIRST COURSES
AS WINTER QUARTER

REGISTRATION OPENS

General registration which began
Tuesday will continue until Friday,
Dec. 10, announces the dean’s office.
However, in spite of the fact that
registration is hardly more than be-
gun, several courses have already
been filled. All survey courses and
especially General Survey 101, rate
highest in popularity. English 130,
131, and 132 are much sought after
while Philosophy 104, and Prof. Nel-
son’s Advanced Public Speaking are
jammed to capacity. Students wish-
ing to make changes in their registra-
tion programs will be permitted to
do so until Dec. 10.

THE OPEN

<4|UlcCH EESEC AKE, the Chairman of the Editorial Board ap-
proached blandly, grinning one of those good-fellows-get-to-
gether grins, “McCheesecake, how about an editorial?”

“An editorial?” we gasped.

“Yes,” he reiterated, “an editorial. For the editorial column
you know.”

We knew.	*

“On what subject shall we write this editorial?” we queried.

“Oh,” he replied casually, "you may utilize for your purpose
any one of the several planks of the Editorial Platform of this Paper.”

“And just what is the Editorial Platform of this Paper?”

The Chairman of the Editorial Board recoiled at this question,
but in a few moments he assumed the poise and composure typical
of Chairmen of Editorial Boards. “As a member of the Editorial
Board (our chest swelled with pride), “as a member of the
Editorial Board,” he pronounced loftily, “you are expected to be
conversant with each and every plank of the Editorial Platform of
this Paper.”

We were nonplussed, as the boys say. We pondered. * How
about our plank asking for an open door to the Coffee Shop until
10 P. M.?”

"Excellent!” the Chairman of the Editorial Board exclaimed.
“A capital idea!” And after a few moment of silence: “Look here,
old bean: try to strike a new note this time. About two hundred
fifty words. I must be off to water polo practice.”

The Chairman of the Editorial Board donned his coat.

“So long,” he said.

“Saloon,” we rejoined.

And as the back of the Chairman of the Editorial Board dis-
appeared in the offing, we chuckled. “That’s a horse on the Chair-
man of the Editorial Board,” we chuckled again. “He is ostensibly
going to practice water polo, whatever that may be, for the dear old
Alma Mater. He is actually bound for the Coffee Shop, where
into warm his gullet with a cup of coffee (5c with sugar and cream;
4c with cream; 3c in the saucer; 2c out of the percolator).” We
chuckled a third time. “It’s one minute past five,’’ upon scrutiniz-
ing our watch, “and the Coffee Shop is closed. We chuckled a
fourth time, and sat down to write.

“NUMBER ONE”

MR STAGG S GRIDIRON will be bereft of any evidences of the
Fifty-fifth street business men’s association next year. Ken
Rouse, the new captain, will not wear the “55“ of the grocery stores
and ribbon counters. Not that he has anything against the 55th Street
Business Men’s Association, for indeed they are among the team’s
most loyal and enthusiasic supporters, but rather because he feels
that the football squad should bear no evidences of commercialism.
Ken Rouse will resume the traditional captain’s numeral: “I”.

This year has probably been a true innovation as far as super-
courtesy to business on the gridiron is concerned. With the return
to the captain’s traditional “1“ that number will probably be a perm-
anent fixture. It will mean that there is not a single characteristic in
evidence at a football game of anything commercial or professional,
unless it is the aerial advertisements which float in gaudy predomi-
nance over the field.

Reverend Perry J. Stackhouse of
the First Baptist Church, Chicago,

IN CLOSE MATCH

First Greek Champion In
Three Years; Defeat

Phi Kappa Sigma

Playing in the horseshoe champion-
ship finals for the third time in suc-
cessive years, Kappa Nu defeated Phi
Kappa Sigma yesterday in a closely
contested match which balanced dan-
gerously for each team until Klaff
ended the second and deciding game
with a ringer on a 20-19 score.

Ringers Valuable

In each of the three teams mated
the score went to a 1-1 tie with
Balch and Kutner winning the first
match for Kappa Nu. The most ex-
citing game of the contest was
Cooper-Erickson vs. Klaff-Gettle-
man. The first game was
won by the Phi Kaps when Cooper
dropped two ringers to win 21-10. In
the second match Klaff and Gettle-
man looped several ringers to tie the
score in games. Klaff featured with
two stake shots in succession. The
decisive third match showed skillful
playing on both sides with the victor
in doubt until Klaff’s timely ringer.

More Ringer*

In the third match the score was
Phi Kap 1 and Kappa Nu 1 with
Heimbach’s ringer making the score
8-4 in favour of the latter for the
third game. The final settlement of
the other games ended this match
before the winners were decided.

For the last two years Kappa Nu
had lost out in the finals to the
Macs, non-fraternity champions. This
is the first time in three years that
the University trophy goes to the
Greeks.

Drop Graded Gym Requirement for
Women; Registration Is Optional

Graded gym will not be required
this winter quarter according to a
new policy adopted by the women’s
physical education department. Reg-
istration will be optional as it has
been in fall and spring. Students will
choose the sport they wish to take
and elective classes will meet four
•lays a week instead of two as has
heretofore been the case. Graded
gym has been scratched off the sched-
ule, and Danish gymnastics, an op-
tional course, is being offered in its
place.

Miss Margaret L. Burns, instruc-
tor in the women’s physical education
department of the University, who
studied under Nils Buch, originator
ot Danish gymnastics, while in Eu-
rope last year, contrasted them with
graded gym. “Nils Buch has evolved
an interesting system of gymnastics,”
said Miss Burns. “They are not at

TO REORGANIZE

U. RIFLE CLUB

University Rifle Club, which has
been more or less inactive during the
past year due to lack of financial sup-
port has been reorganized. Through
the influence of the president’s office,
the necessary support has been ob-
tained.

“The club has one of the finest
ranges in the country and excellent
coaches. W. Garlington, president of
the Illinois State Rifle Association,
is coach for the women, and R. D.
Bensley, coach for the men, is one
of the best rifle shots in the U. S.,”
said Charles J. Chamberlain, former
Rifle Club coach.

The University is heating and
lighting the range ,and furnishing the
instructors. Rifles and instruction

more than they do calisthenics.
There is rapid change of movement
from one part of the body to an-
other and the pupil must be on the
alert constantly in order to perform
the various exercises correctly. There
is nothing slow about Danish gym-
nastics. They move rapidly and
without any breaks. In addition to
their value as an exercise they offer
a means of recreation. They are real
play, real fun, “not just the regular
cut and dried type of gymnastics.”

Danish gymnastics have been
growing in popularity within the last
few years. Nils Buch was in this
country two years ago with a group
of Danes, giving demonstrations and
the Y. W. C. A. and other organiza-
tions have responded to the popular
demand for this new type of exercise
by organizing classes. Now that
Danish gymnastics are being offered

COACH NORGREN

DEVOTES TIME TO

DRILLING CAGERS

“Fritz” Well Fitted For New
Job; Will Start

Practice Early

It was officially announced at the
athletic offiice, yesterday, that Herb
“Fritz” Crisler would assume the du-
ties of coaching the future varsity
baseball teams of the University of
Chicago, as the successor to Coach
Nels Norgren.

This change came about through
the desire of Coach Norgren to de-
vote all his time to the tutoring of
the squad of basketball aspirants. It
is necessary that the baseball squad
starts indoor practice before the bas-
keball season is over, and the change
will mean that both coaches can de-
vote more time to their respective
teams.

To Start Early

Coach Crisler hopes to get a flying
start on the coming baseball season
by commencing practice in the early
part of the winter quarter. He, in
addition to this, will continue to
coach the freshmen basketball squad.

Coach Crisler is well equipped to
take over his new duties, through his
playing experience as a stellar pitch-
er on the Maroon nine and his ex-
perience as former Freshmen Base-
ball Coach. '

Coach Crisler starred as a member
of the Maroon baseball teams of ’20,
’21, and ”22 making the trip to the
orient in 1921. He was one of the
most consistent twirlers on the squad
and duly commanded thA respect of
all Maroon opponents.

Crisler is at present making a
speaking tour throughout the coun-
try, talking on athletics and their
importance in the lives of the youths
of today. His successor to coach
Freshmen Baseball has not yet been
announced.

at the University, the women’s physi-
cal education department expects a
rapidly increasing interest to develop
in them here.

“People from all over the world
come to the little town of Ollerup,
Denmark, where Nils Buch has his
school, to enroll in his classes,” said
Miss Burns. “His reputation is world
wide and interest in his gymnastics is
keen. Besides studying under Buch
I visited three physical education
schools for women and saw hockey
matches between preparatory school,
college, professional, territorial and
international teams.”

Opener More Than

A “Practice” Game

Although termed a “practice
game,” the contest which Coach A.
A. Stagg has scheduled for the open-
ing battle on his next year’s grid card
threatens to be a tough one.

It is with Benny Owen’s Univer-
sity of Oklahoma eleven, one of the
leading members of the Missouri
Valley Conference, and always famed
for a highly deceptive and intricate
forward passing game. Oklahoma
lost one game this season, defeating
Missouri, the team that upset Stagg’s
1924 champs, in a hard game. Next
year’s meeting will be the first foot-
ball relationship between the two
schools in their respective athletic
histories.

This games adds another intersec-
tional contest to the long list of sim-
ilar battles which have been placed
on the early season schedules of re-
cent Maroon teams. Former inter-
sectional games were with Missouri,
Kentucky, Florida, Maryland, Geor-
gia, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Dart-
mouth and Princeton.

SEVEN TEAMS ON

WRESTLING CARD

Lack of space in yesterday’s Ma-
roon did not permit the printing of
the wrestling schedule among those
of the other varsity teams. It is
therefore here presented:

Jan. 15. .Michigan State at Michigan

State

Jan. 21. . . .Northwestern at Chicago

Jan. 28.....Minnesota at Minnesota

Feb. 5..............Iowa at Chicago

Feb. 12........Illinois at Illinois

Feb. 19........Wisconsin at Chicago

Mar. 5..................Place meet

The Conference Meet will be held
the 11th and 12th of March in Bart-
lett Gym.

According to Coach Vorres men to
wrestle in the heavyweight class are
badly needed. As yet none have ap-
peared at practice and it is neces-
sary, if Chicago is to enter a well
rounded team in the title race that

men of over 175 pounds report to the
coach at once. Men in all other
weights are also desired.

It is expected that before the reg-
ular schedule starts there will be a
few dual meets with the local clubs.
One of the traditional rivals in this
group ate the Hawthorne Rivals.

Few men have returned from last
year’s squad. Store is back at 115
lbs. Sternfield at 125, Kirks at 145,
Penstone at 158, and Captain Krogh,
last year’s Conference champion, at
175. Expected to fill the ranks at
115 135, 145, and 175 classes are
freshmen numeral winners from last
year.

PSI HPSILON, DELTA UPSILON,

Several Strong Teams Enter
Stars; Finals, Feature

Events Friday

The preliminaries of the Third
Annual Swimming will be run off this
afternoon at 3:30. The entries have
come in from almost every organiza-
tion on the campus. The Chi Psi’s,
Sig Chis, Delta Sigs and Phi Psis
have all entered strong squads and
have hopes of copping the meet. It
will be a big day for the I-M division.
Over 300 men have entered this car-
nival and the waters of Bartlett pool
will be in constant agitation all after-
noon and many are the boys who will
rub down with liniment tonight.

Preliminaries in every event will
be run in several heats and the time
made by the contestants will decide
whether or not they will be admit-
ted to the finals on Friday. Five men
will qualify for every race and as
five places count there will be keen
competition for a chance to go into
the finals. Swimmers have been
working out in Bartlett pool for a
month previous to this affair and
spectators are going to be treated to
some fine swimming.

Individual Star*

Bill Weddell, who has done some
good swimming in former carnivals,
will swim for Phi Psi. With his help
their strong swimming aggregation
will fight it out with the others who
have entered. Dick Hough and
Maury Wadley are the hope of Chi
Psi and are expected to do well in
their events. Both of these men
have hung up good records in previ-
ous attempts. Bob Faris, John Grif-
fin and Joe WecHer will perform for
Delta Siknia, Phi. Faris and Griffin
are well known as swimmers around
the natatorium and Joe Weckler
placed second last year in fancy div-
ing.

Entries are being received for the
novelty events now. All swimmers
in the University are eligible for
these events and although no points
will be given for competing in them
prizes will be awarded to those who
make the best showing. -

Psi U s’“Come Back” In Final
Period To Tie D. U.

Team, 12-12

In the feature game of the day,
D. U. and Psi U. played a sensation-
al 12 to 12 tie. D. U. started out
with a rush and with a series of pret-
ty passes took the ball fifty yards for
a touchd/wn. An intercepted pass
followed by a sixty-five yard run by
Lobey paved the way for the second
D. U. touchdown. Schneberger car-
ried the ball over for the score.

P*i U’* Strengthen

Psi U. looked like a different team
in the second half and tied the score.
Long runs by Libby and a nice pass
to Polland who starred throughout
the game accounted for their first
score. Lott carried the ball over to
tie the count.

Clark’s long run for D. U. and
Gudon’s work for Psi U. were other
outstanding features of the game. It
was a rough and hard fought affair.

Another Tie

Another tie resulted in the other
semi-final game when Phi Sigma Del-
ta scored in the last minute of play
to knot the count at six all. In the
first half, Brill intercepted a pass and
ran 30 yards for the Macs’ touch-
down. Late in the second half Preiss
passed to Bieles who was tagged on
the one yard line. On the next play
Preiss passed to Geltspan for the
score. Darkness prevented further
play-

The semi-finals between the D.
U. and Psi U. and the Macs and Phi
Sigma Delta will be played on Fri-
day afternoon.
