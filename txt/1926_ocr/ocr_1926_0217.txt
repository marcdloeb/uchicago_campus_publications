ENFORCE 18TH
AMENDMENT ON
NIGHT OF PROM

Ask Greeks to Maintain
Dignity; Threaten
Ejection

Drastic measures will be taken to
prevent drinking at the 1926 Wash-
ington Prom. The Prom leaders de-
clared in a statement last night that
any who became at all intoxicated at
the dance would be asked to leave.

As many notables from the Uni-
versity are to be present at the af-
fair, the leaders make an especial
appeal to the students to remain so-
ber. It is already known that Presi-
dent Max Mason and Harold Swift,
chairman of the Board of Trustees,
will be present.

Send Letters To Greeks

An open letter was sent to all the
fraternities Monday and was read
Monday night in the metings of the
various Greek letter societies. The
letter, which made an appeal that
the men retain their dignity and re-
main sober, was as follows:

“The laders of the Washington
Prom earnestly request your co-
operation with them in the matter
of the prevention of drinking at the
Promenade next Friday night.

Uphold Reputation

“In past years the students have
established a very good reputation
for the omission of drinking on this
occasion and we urge you to uphold
this reputation this year by refrain-
ing yourselves and by influencing
others to refrain from either bring-
ing liquor with them or indulging in
it at the dance.

“Dean Boucher is very anxious
that we uphold the no-drinking rec-
ord made last year at the Prom and
it will be necessary for the officials
of the South Shore Country Club
and the Prom leaders to take drastic
action if any one is intoxicated this
year.

“For your own good and for the
sake of future Proms therefore we
hope you will do your utmost to pre-
vent drinking.”

(Signed) The Prom Committee^

The officials of the country club;
have declared that the annual dance i
must close at 1 o’clock, but the
Prom leaders are attempting to have
the time extended until two.

Name* Mutt Be In

“The leaders of the Washington
ticket holder must have had his name
registered with the officials of the
committee, and that if any tickets
hav(e been| Resold the transaction
must be reported by next Thursday
afternoon.

A picture will be taken of the
Prom during the grand march, which
will start at 9 :45, so the Prom lead-
ers are urging that couples arrive
early.

BESTOW HONOR

ON DR. CRAIGIE

English Professor Receives
Foreign Recognition

Dr. William A. Craigie, professor
of English at the University, and edi-
tor of the Oxford dictionary’ and of
the dictionary of American English
now in the process of compilation at
the University’ has been elected for-
eign member of the Royal Bohemian
Society of Science and Letters, it is
announced. Dr. Craigie’s election, re-
garded as a signal honor in the field
of letters, came “in consideration of
the eminent service he has rendered to
the Polish people.”

Dr. Craigie has traveled and taught
over most of the known world, con-
centrating his efforts in Poland and
among other Bohemian peoples. For
several years he was a professor of
Anglo-Saxon at Oxford. In October.
1023. Dr. Craigie lectured on the Eng-
lish language at the University of
Prague, and at the University of Brno,
where he became acquainted with sev-1
eral p r o m i n e n t Czecho-Slovakian
scholars who have now welcomed him
to their society. During the autumn
of 1925, Dr. Craigie came to the Uni-
versity a< a professor of English, and
he is completig his dictionary at the
present time. The Oxford dictionary
was started twenty-five years ago, and
Dr. Craigie took up the work when
the original compiler died.

UNIVERSITY CADETS
COMPLY WITH U. S.
CHANGE IN UNIFORM

(’adet officers of the Military' Sci-
ence department will receive new
uniforms made according to the lat-
est government regulations, accord-
ing to Major Frederick Barrows,
head of the department. These reg-
ulations require a lapel-collar service
coat with four buttons, worn with ।
olive drab or plain white shirts,
black ties, and rolled or semi-stiff
collars. The overcoat to be worn
with the uniform is also to be made
with a lapel. The collar insignia has
not been decided upon. No other al-
terations will be made in the existing
regulations.

Agitation for a change from the
high-collared, uncomfortable uni-
forms has been heard ever since the
World War, according to Major Bar-
rows. Fifteen different new styles
were submitted for approval to the
Secretary of War, of which the one
chosen was considered the best. Ex-
isting uniforms will be altered to
conform as nearly as possible to
the new regulations. The govern-
ment will stand the expense of the
alteration.

PUBLICATION BOARD MEETS

An important meeting of the
Board of Student Publications has
been called. The meeting will take
place today at 3:30 in Mr. O’Hara’s
office.

McCRACKEN TO
REPLACE WEIMER
AS JUNIOR HEAD

Pro Tem Action Taken By
Class Council; Weimer

May Return

Ellen .McCracken, vice-presidfent
of the Junior class, was placed in
the presidential chair of the class
pro tem by a joint resolution of the
class council last night. No definite
replacement was made.

The action was taken in order that
the class might resume its activities
after the departure of George C.
Weimer, president, who was called
home due to the sudden illness of
his mother.

Weimer Expected Back in Spring

The action which places Ellen
McCracken in the presidential chair
is only tetmporary according to
Bradley’ Davies, treasurer of the
class. The class awaits further ac-
tion of the Undergraduate council
and of the class executive council it-
self.

It is possible that the class may
have a re-election in the spring if
George Weimer is unable to resume
his activities. However, as he is ex-
pected to be back the pro tem action
was taken.

McCracken Take* Up Dutie*

Ellen McCracken will fill the va-
cancy left on the Undergraduate
council until further arrangements
are made. Class activities have been
resumed w’ith the plans for a class
mixer February 26.

“Although nothing definite can be
planned on,” said Bradley Davies,
class treasurer, last night, “we ex-
pect to resume the activities as they
were left by Weimer.”

Women Should
Leave Toil for

Politics—Goode

Government is women’s own busi-
ness, and women should mind their
business, State Representative Kath-
erine Hancock Goode declared yester-
day in an address before the Young
Women’s Christtian Association ot
the University.

“Scientific experimentation,” said
Mrs. Goode, “has answered all the
questions that women used to ask each
other over the baik fences.

“Freed by science from household
drudgery',” Mrs. Goode continued,
“intelligent women with, fifty per
cent of all political power in their
hand, must seize their great op-
portunity' to promote general welfare.
They' must select with utmost care
those who legislate, and hold them to
the strictest account for their acts,
uphold those who promote welfare and
remove those who betray their trust.

“It is government which has neces-
sarily taken over women’s responsib-
ilities. and it is to government that
women must turn to if they are to
meet those responsibilities. Govern-
ment is a co-operative job.”

Jewish Students
Complete Plans
For Organization

Tentative plans for a campus or- \
ganization of Jewish students have]
been completed by the committee of i
ten which was chosen early in the
year. The first meeting has been an- j
nounced for Tuesday, March 2, at
7:30 in the Reynolds club theatre.
All Jewish students interested have
been invited to attend this meeting,
which will be addressed by Dr. Solo-
mon Freehoff, of the K. A. M. Tem-
ple.

The plans which have been com-
piled are the results of a quarter’s
work by’ the committee in charge,
headed by Leon Despres. They’ pro-1
vide for an organization with the
double aim of affording contacts for
Jewish students among themselves
and promoting acquaintance with
Jewish achievement and history.

“The* need of such an organization
has been long felt,” said Despres.
“Two previous attempts were made
to fill the need, but both were un-
successful. The committee feels con-
fident that the present enterprise
will be successful, because it is built
on a much more sound basis than
a|iy Jewish organization that has
ever been on this campus.”

bers and non-members of W. A. A.

PROM-GOERS TO
SEE GRETCHEN

OF HEIDELBURG

Miss Manners of “Student
Prince” Cast Is

Secured

Prom-goers are to receive a reil
treat next Friday evening when dur-
ing the intermission. Tatiicia Ann
Manners, one of the leading ladies of
the “Student Prince,” will entertain
with a few vocal selections. This was
the promise made by Paul Cullom
and ( atherine ( ampbcll. Washington
Prom leaders, after a trip down town
yesterday morning.

Miss Manners plays the part of the
comedienne. Gretchen, in the musical
production .which has been playing to
capacity’ houses for nearly’ a year. In
her part, she has to sing several songs,
dance, and in general, to keep the stu-
dents of Heidclburg and the audience
in good humor. That she has suc-
ceeded in this is evidenced by’ the fact
that while there have been several
changes in the personnel of the
“Student Prince.” she has easily re-
tained her position.

Will Not Be Alone

Miss Manners will not be the sole
entertainer at the Prom if the plans
of the leaders culminate. Last year
several theater celebrities were es-
corted to the dance by’ campus men,
and it is the intention this year to have
just as many’, if not more.

“In selecting Miss Manners,” said
Cullum, “we believe that we have
made a choice that will be more than
agreeable to those attending the Prom.
Surely if she. as Gretchen, can enter-
tain the students of Heidelburg, she
will be able to entertain the students
of the University.”

BISHOP WISE TO OPEN
LENTEN SERVICES
WITH TALK

Lenten services bringing to the WO’
men of the University the fullest sig-
nificance of the 'Lenten season will be
held every Wednesday for four weeks
beginning today at 4 in the Y. W.
C. A. room of Ida Noyes hall. Bishop
Janies Wise of Kansas City will speak
on “Discovering Hidden Values in
Life.”

Dr. E. S. Ames of the department
of Philosophy will speak at the second
service. The third lecture will be given
by Dr. Edgar J. Goodspeed of the
Divinity school. The last meeting will
include a talk by Dr. C. W. Gilkey of
the Hyde Park Baptist church.

OFFER FISKE PRIZE

IN POETRY CONTEST

Poems to be submitted in compe-
tition for the John Billings Fiske
prize must be in the President’s of-
fice before March 1. Any student in
the University who has not before
won the prize is eligible to compete.

There art* no limitations as to
length, subject or form but only one
poem may be submitted, this if de-
sired may be a cycle, containing sev-
eral poems all closely related. The
contributions must be typewritten
and signed with a pseudonym, ac-
companied by a sealed envelope con-
taining the name and address of
the writer, according to the an-
nouncement.

SOCIAL WORKER TO
DEFINE PERSONAUTY

“What does a Social Service
Worker mean by Personality?” Miss
Helen Clark will give her interpreta-
tion at a tea under the auspices of
the Social Service club at 4:30 in
Ida Noyes hall. The word “person-
ality” is often used by the Social
service worker in case work and
many persons have wondered what
the exact meaning of the word sig-
nifies.

SZIGETI PLAYS AT MANDEL HALL

By Alfred V. Frankenstein

IF Joseph Szigeti is ever called on to demon-
strate that the composers of the classics of
violin literature were inordinately dull fellows,
he con do no better than to repeat the first half
of the program he played at Mandel hall yester-
day afternoon. That half consisted of a sonata
by Tartini and one by Bach. Neither could be
classed as entertainment, or that more important
sort of experience one expects from an artist of
Szigeti’s rating.

“Music is for the glory of God and for delight-
ful recreation,” said old J. S. Bach, and by “re-
creation” he meant the fun the player, not the
listener, can get out of the works he wrote in
secular vein. For it is fun to conquer the dif-
ficulties of one of his sonatas for unaccompanied
violin, and more fun to have such a long memory
that one can play such a sonata without the
notes. But one’s audience may feel differently
about it.

The folk hat crowded Mandel yesterday wore,
for the main part, the expression of people who
find themselves up against something really
highbrow. Others, ignorant of the reputations
of Tartini and Bach, or thoroughly conversant
with their creations, slept.

But when the first part was over, Szigeti gave
us some music. He played Mozart’s naively
gorgeous D. major concerto, and played it with
that sympathy, and understanding of the com-
poser and that mastership of the violin that has
made him one of the great fiddlers. He played
the concerto with the cadenzas written for it
by Herr Doktor Joseph Joachim, Professor of
the Kaiserliche Hochschule fur Husik, Berlin,
which cadenzas fit Mozart as a thick coating of
turkey gravy fit milk chocolate. Cadenzas, all
cadenzas, are as artistic as plumbing, but far less
useful, and nineteenth century cadenzas to Moz-
art are likely to be more awful than words can
express. But, fortunately, Joachim’s unwelcome
additions to the concerto are short.

Those who left in the general exodus follow-
ing the Mozart missed the best music of the
whole show, a selection from Bloch’s “Baal
Shem” suite. Bloch was born in Switzerland.
He has a German name, writes all his titles in
French, and lives in California. But with all this
mixture of nationalities, Bloch has never pre-
tended to be anything but a Jew, which can not
be said of many Jewish composers. The music
of Bloch is completely and entirely Jewish, and
by this I do not mean that it exhibits the boozy
neurosis of the “Eili Eili.” It does not wail, it
affirms, in the same strong, bold manner that
has made Jewish literature the religious guide
of centuries.

Some of Hubay’s Hungarian fireworks closed
the program

SATIRE AND PROGRESS

ATTACKING the naive, the commonplace, and
the vulgar, is a useful job—but not a crea-
tive one. It is somtehing like going through a
fraternity house after bedtime (as our steward
sometimes does) and turning out the lights that
careless brothers have left burning. There is
fun in it, as there is fun in tripping up our fel-
low’s of any of their shortcomings; but picking
up spilt beans is never creative. It is necessary
but even if successful not noble.

Too many creative minds have taken as their
lifework the ridicule of what is dead in our soci-
ety. They do the job well, for they have brains,
and they have plenty of material. Their work
is admired, because they spice it with audacity,
with a show of irreverence. Suppose they suc-
ceed. Granted. Suppose the world wakes up to

its provinciality, and sells out its butter and
jggs. Will the millennium be there? No. A
fault will have been corrected, to be sure; but
nothing positive will have been gained. The
world will be more nearly ready, then, for some
creative thinker to lead it forword. Where these
satirists leave off (if they succeed) progress will
be in a position to begin. Their work will have
its value; but it is not a noble work. It is the
pulling of civilization’s decayed teeth—a neces-
ary job, but not an inspired one. A true leader,
a creator, will see no joy in such work; nor
should he undertake it. It requires skill, but not
talent. He can leave it to others.

Nor are these assailants of the bourgeois vir-
tues in any way sure of stamping them out.
Many a community booster has heard the Kiwa-
nis Club ridiculed, and joined lustily in the attack
—himself belonging to the Lions club. Many
a dealer in collars and shirts, or soaps and
lotions, or fig and bran flakes, has helped to
burn in effigy his less fortunate colleague of the
butter-and-egg industry. Indeed, w’e sometimes
fear that the man who claps his hands loudest
in celebration of Charley’s approach, is Charley
himself.

The present ridcule, then, offers little hope of
a cure for commonplaceness and vulgarity. Men
who pursue such a course are working at a non-
creativc job, a job whose end is to remove an
evil—and with little chance of success.

COLLEGE is not without its satirists. Talented
observers ridicule many things in college
life, because many things in college life, because
life, because many things in college life deserve
to be ridiculed. We sometimes are naive, or
commonplace, or vulgar—as is the world outside
our walls. Cottage Grove and the Midway are
no pale.

The man downtown spends his life dictating
letters; the factory worker makes holes with a
steel drill till the whistle blows; the college stu-
dent passes his four years in attending lectures,
submitting reading reports, and'writing quizzes.
The other fellow draws a pay check every Satur-
day; we draw a grade card every quarter. In
order that we may be still more business-like,
still more proficient in the latest methods, we
have activities: we publish daily newspapers
that tend more or less toward the forms of the
papers downtown; we print miniatures of Life
and Judge; we stage huge shows, musical com-
edies, and track meets, and strive to emulate
Belasco, George Cohan, and Tex Rickard.

To hide the monotony of routine, and create
the appearance of progress, the Kiwanis club
has its boosters; we have our yell-leader. The
business concern has its go-getting salesmen, its
house organ, and its sales talk; the fraternity
has its high-powered rushers, its monthly or
quarterly magazine, and its rushing argument.

Naturally enough, making fun of all this is a
popular job—and even when well done, not a
hard one. It is little wonder that the editors of
college literary magazines, the writers of best-
sellers about college, and others who make their
attacks only over the tea table, should call col-
lege Babbitt’s latest hang-out. The collegian
has become a big arts-and-lit man. College is
a machine; the freshman is its raw material;
the smooth, college-cut senior, varying as little
as possible from his type, is its finished product.
(Thus a cartoonist in an Eastern university
paper allegorizes the situation). From 9 to 10
we are expected to be deeply concerned about
the Romantic Period, say; from 10 to 11 we
must have an overwhelming interest in the
Labor Problem; from 11 to 12 our heart and
soul must be on Elements of Geology. The pro-
fessor doles out a one-hour dose of knowledge
to a hundred pupils at a time. He can do little
toward guiding individuals in his class; he
knows only a few of them.

'FHESE severe charges have truth about them
■*• and if heeded will make better colleges pos-
sible; but their work will not in any event be
creative. They will (if successful) clear the field
—no more.

Too many of the best creative minds among
American undergraduates—minds from which
ideas for progress should come—are busy at this
job of ridicule. Too many more, though not
themselves engaged, are cowed by the ridicule
of the rest. The removal of dead tissue is not
progress. Satire and travesty become mere
fashion of the day, and lose their force. College
(or any other human affair) will never advance
under the fire of ridicule. College will advance
only when new ideas, boldly conceived and boldly
born, stir its blood.

Chicago—	Purdue—	
Sackett	LF	Spradling
Zimmerman	RF	Neuman
Alyea	C	Cramer
McDonough	LG	Wilcox
Hoerger	RG	Wright

With one of the toughest games
of the season staring them in the
face. Coach Nels Norgren and his
hopeful Maroon eagers will depart
from the Englewood Station at 10:25
this morning for Lafayete where they
will attempt to break their losing
streak and down the fast going Boil-
ermakers. Purdue, with a record of
an early season victory over the Chi-
cago aggregation, added to the ad-
vantage of the home floor, will enter
the game as the favorite although
the Chicago team this season has
the record as the greatest litle up-
setter in the conference and may
make things interesting for the
Lambertmen.

Norgren will undoubtedly start
Zimmerman and Sackett, his regular
forwards, and of course Alyea will
be at the pivot position. Zimmerman
has been going great of late and is
at present high point man of the
team while Sackett is playing a
sparkling floor game. The guard
situation is a big problem with Mc-
Donough on the sidelines. If Mc-
Donough is able to play, he and
Hoerger will hold down the defensive
positions; if not, either Marks or
Farwell has showed up well the last
few weeks and is a strong possibility
for the game.

Neuman and Spradling look like
the starting forwards for Purdue.
The ability of Spradling is too well
known while Neuman has been trav-
eling at a break neck speed and was
high point man for his team against
Indiana Saturday night. Taube will
probably get in the game at one of
the forwards. Cramer is the logical
man for center. Wilcox, the midget
sophomore who was the sensation of
the grid, seems to have ousted Wright
as regular guard, and will undoubt-
edly start the encounter. Against
I. U. he was the sensation of the
game, quelling rally after rally and
at the same time garnering three
field goals for himself. Wilson is
the other defensive man although

Pete Jolly will undoubtedly break in-

to the game, also.

MAROON QUINTET AT
PURDUE WEDNESDAY
FOR RETURN GAME

Lafayette, Ind., Feb. 16—Special
to the Daily Maroon)—Guarding
Spradling will not be the only big
job for the Chicago guards as Wil-
cox, Wilson and Neuman are dang-
erous at all times, as was demon-
strated in the spectacular clash with
Indiana here last Saturday night
which Purdue won in the closing sec-
onds on a basket by Wilson. Cram-
er’s basket eye has been somewhat
erractic of late, but he may take the
Maroon tilt as a start toward more
and better shots.

Hanging on the outside rim of the
conference title chase, Purdue needs
a victory over Chicago to retain its
precarious perch.

Kappa Sigma, Alpha
Sig Play for Title

Tonight at the University High
Gym, the last of the pre-semin-
final cage tilts take place when
Kappa Sigma clashes with the Al-
pha Sigs for the championship of
the Alpha league. The Kappa
Sigs are favored to win, since
they have not been defeated thus
far and boast a stellar outfit with
Schaeffer and Oker.

In a “B” league game the Phi
Sigs meet the Kappa Sig “B”
team in what promises to be a
closely contested battle. The In-
termural Department also an-
nounced that the games schedul-
ed for last night were postponed
until tomorrow night.

With the semifinalist contend-
ers ascertained drawing will be
held to pair the teams for the im-
portant final round which starts
next Monday night.

BUCKS PREPARE

FOR TRACKMEET

Columbus, Ohio, Feb. 16—Coach
Castleman’s tracksters, defeated by
Wesleyan last Saturday in their first
meet of the season, have no contest
scheduled for ithis week-end, and
so are going through time and dis-
tance trials in the Stadium.

The Bucks are preparing for the
annual quadrangular meet with Chi-
cago, Northwestern, and Wisconsin,
which will be held next Saturday at
the Evanston, Ill., gym. The State
men, with the exception of Russe,
who has been suffering from sore
logs all season, and Black, who turn-
ed an ankle at Delaware, are in good
shape, and Coach Castleman is look-
ing for them to make a better show-
ing next week than they did against
the Bishops.

Last year the indoor quadrangular
meet was won by Wisconsin, with
State only five points behind the
leaders, closely followed by Chicago
and Northwestern. The Bucks show-
ing was largely due to the work of
Guthrie and Snyder in the hurdles,
and the relay teams. This season,
with Captain Guthrie, Irwin, Ken-
nedy, and Arnold, all veterans, and
Tooley and Brown, sophomores, Ohio
has an aggregation not as strong as
last year’s but yet formidable
enough to make the others step high
to win.

Wisconsin, although Schwartze,
weight man, is ineligible, seems to
have the best team of the four, per-
haps the best in the conference. Cap-
tain McAndrews in the sprints and
hurdles and McGinnis, a high jump-
er, both have won first places at the
Evanston meet. These two men,
along with Chapman, conference
cross country champion of 1925, and
others from the hill and dale team,
will count heavily in the scoring. The
Badgers hook up with Iowa tomor-
row for their first start of the sea-
son.

Squad Travels for First
Time This Year
On Saturday

Coach Hoffer, quite satisfied with
the results of the Milwaukee “Y” and
Ohio State meets, is worried over the
fate of the gymnasts, for on the com-
ing Saturday, they go to Lafayette to
vie with the gymnasts representing
Purdue.

Boilermakers Strong

Some of the recent activities of the
Indiana men have afforded the Bart-
lett performers plenty to think about
when they board the train in the
Boilermaker camp. Wisconsin, al-
ways strong in athletic circles and
none the less in gymnasium work,
was beaten decisively by the Maroon’s
next opponents. But their greatest
achievement was the licking they pre-
sented the University of Pennsylvania. ,
This victory is noteworthy, for al-
though th Navy has predominated
Eastern gymnastics for almost a de-
cade, they are always forced to per-
form in their best style when they
meet Penn.

Meet Navy

Notwithstanding the strength of ।
the Purdue men Coach Hoffer always
has an eye open towards developing
his performers for the great Navy
team, which when it comes here March
6 will have a trail of scalps stretching
clear from Annapolis, the home beau-
tiful of the Gobs, all the way West.

The Navy meet is the one Hoffer is
pointing his team for all this season.

DECIDE DORMITORY
CHAMPIONSHIP IN

BASKETBALL TODAY

Today will be the scene of several
hard-fought battles in both the inter-
class and inter-dormitory tournament*.
In both of these the competition has
been unusually strong this year, and
tomorrow will show which are the
weaker teams and which are the cham-
pionship contestants.

The inter-class games come in the
afternoon at 3:45, and the inter-hall
contests at 7:15 in the evening. Miss
Wylie, faculty advisor of the basket-
ball tournaments, says, “There has
been much improvement in the play
since the opening of the season, and
we are expecting to see some real bas-
ketball this afternoon.”

ILLINI BATSMEN

BEGIN PRACTICE

Urbana, Feb. 16.—Coach Carl L.
Lundgren centered his eyes on the
mound candidates as the varsity
baseball aspirants swung into the
second week of practice yesterday
afternoon in the big cage in the Ar-
mory. Veterans and novices alike
took their turns in the “bull pens”
and tested their throwing, while
batsmen poised at the plate and
chanced at their offerings.

Barta, Harrington and O’Shaugn-
essy looked as if they were rapidly
rounding into form as they whipped
the ball down the netted alleys.
Barta is a veteran of last year’s first
string and is looked to as one of the
mainstays of this season’s pitching
staff. Harrington and O’Shaughnes-
sy were also members of last year’s
varsity squad, but failed to break
into the letter winning contingent.

Dahlquist and “Bud” Stewart are
making their first bid for varsity
attention. Both men cut up worthy
capers on the frosh varsity last
spring and seem to have the mak-
ings of likely varsity twirlers. Des-

mond also was a member of the frosh

team and he is being given the once
over as he does his bit in the pens.

WRESTLING AND TRACK AND FIELD
EVENTS; FEATURED BY NOVELTIES

Fraternity Singing; Surprise Stunts On Bill; Hope to
Culminate Affair With Big Dance On
Bartlett Gymnasium Floor

An immense athletic carnival, one
that will have all of the pomp and
social aspects of the Olympic games
with a few new stunts thrown in, is
in store for the University of Chi-
cago. Doctor Molander, faculty ad-
visor and active driving force behind
the Intramural department, announc-
ed today that plans are complete for
the biggest indoor athletic meet in
the University’s history.

The affair, which will be held on
March 4th and which will be known
as the Second Annual Indoor Ath-
letic Revue, will include besides the
finals in the basketball, wrestling,
fencing, and track and field events,
fraternity singing, surprise effects
and novelty stunts. Efforts are be-
ing made to culminate the evening
with a dance on the Bartlett gymnas-
ium floor which will be the scene of
the Athletic Revue.

Secure Ted Cante

The Intramural department has
been fortunate in securing the ser-
vices of Ted Cante, Big Ten An-
nouncer of national prominence.
Cante is the announcer who pleases
the patrons of all the National Inter-
collegiate meets with his wit and
amazing volume and clear enuncia-
tion. Mr. Cante will have his hands
full keeping the spectators informed
of all the events which will be oc-
curing with the speed and proficiency
of a three ring circus.

One of the features of the Revue
will be its setting and the manner of
its presentation. Bartlett gym will
be festooned with Maroon and white
colors. Fraternity colors and shields
will adorn the inside of the running
track and special boxes will be ar-
ranged for President Mason and the
Faculty members who have been in-
vited by the Intramural department.
The Revue will be opened with an Im-
pressive parade of all the officials and
contestants and from that moment on

vue and has cooperating with him
such able men as A. A. Stagg, Nels
Norgren, A. A. Stagg, Jr., Fritz
Crisler, Campbell Dickson, and Doc-
tor Molander.

“The Revue this year will be as
great a social affair as it will be an
athletic one,” said Arnold Johnson,
when interviewed at the Intramural
office. “The evening will be an all-
school affair which should draw ev-
ery man and woman connected with
the University. There will be a
Fraternity’s Committee and a Wom-
an’s Committee organized to help on
arrangements and to stimulate the
interest of everyone.

Alumni Interested

The Allumni have expressed their
interest and have offered their help,
but we are afraid that Bartlett Gym-
nasium will not be large enough for
the spectators. Let’s get behind this
affair and pack the old gymnasium
with ourselves and our pep and make
the authorities realize that a new
field house is needed for student af-
fairs as well as for varsity meets.”

Does the Bond Business
Need College Men?

DECIDEDLY, it does. Modern investment banking
requires well trained, analytical minds today, even
more than in the pasr.

Greatly increased wealth in this country has made a
large class of new, rather inexperienced investors. They
need competent, responsible advice—to guide them to-
ward sound investments, suited to their needs.

Complex financing due to organization of business in
larger units requires more alertness in the selection of
securities. Even the experienced bond buyer must have
expen, well-informed service.

Halsey, Stuart & Co. recruits additions to its organiza-
tion,in both the buying and the selling ends, largely from
the universities and colleges. Men are carefully chosen
for their general qualifications and then given special
training for several months, with pay, before they are
assigned to actual work.

If You Are Interested/
in the bond business as a vocation, we shall be glad to
send you out pamphlet containing useful information
