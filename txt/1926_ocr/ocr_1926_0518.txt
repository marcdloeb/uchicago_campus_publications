CHANGE PLANS;
IDA TO BE JAP

GARDEN AT HOP

McDonough Decides on Ela*
borate Decorations for

May 27

- The Interclass Hop, it has been de-
cided, is not going to come off in a
country club after all; it is going to be
held in a Japanese garden. That, at
least is the scheme of decoration for
Ida Noyes hall on the night of May
27, when the affair is set. The Jap-
anese garden idea will be followed out
thoroughly, both floor and grounds
being decorated.

The color scheme will be one cen-
tering on orchid and pink, and every-
thing will work out tn that arrange-
ment. According to the cautious John
McDonough, in charge of the decora-
tions, there will be at least two hun-
dred lanterns used, lots of flowers,
and anything else that strikes the
committee as being particularly Jap-
anese in character.

Use Cherry Blossoms

The entrance to Ida Noyes will be
on the Woodlawn side. The cloisters
will be decorated with apple blossoms,
green smilax and Japanese lanterns,
and the whole will be effectively
masked by the use of but little illum-
ination.

On the dance floor itselt, in the
gymnasium, the orchestra will play
from a latticework cage in the center
of the floor. The cage will be, ac-
cording to McDonough, “elaborately
trimmed" with apple blossoms, the
inevitable smilax (wild ones this time)
and lanterns. There will be a pillar
at each corner of the cage, with fans
extending from them out over the
floor.

Parasols To Be Used

Huge Japanese parasols will hang
from the ceiling, being lighted from
above to bring out their colors. Two
large sets of festoons—eight in each
set—will help out, too. Lights hung
from the ceiling will be at a height of
fifteen feet from the floor, and all the
overhead decorations will hang low
over the floor. A large lantern will
be draped from each big light in the
gym.

Apple blossoms, smilax again, and
huckleberry blossoms—all of these
artificial, of course,—will cover the
walls. No apparatus will be visible in
any part of the gym. The grounds
will work up a garden effect—“lan-
terns, benches appropriately placed,
etc.”—according to McDonough’s re-
port.

Watching “Wallie’s” Coaching
Music, Cast, and Vanishing Plot

By John Allison

Here is to the best first act that’
Blackfriars have put on in many a
year, of the •second act—more anon.
This seems to be the concensus of
opinion as we talked it over in front
of the scene of the first act this morn-
ing. Blackfriars are a part of this cam-
pus and should be considered for their
merits judged from a campus point of
view.

The first thing to state is that the
show had an abundance of talent. Not
only talent but real star talent, any two
or three members of whom might have
furnished a cast for an ordinary show.
This is a show of superlatives and clev-
er personalities. Don, Clyde, Sew and
Hintz form an excellent quartette and

What’s College
Sans a Campus?

What would college be without a
campus or a social set, or a foot-
ball team?

Not a college worth going to
would be the verdict of most stu-
dents, yet such a place really exists.
Commonwealth College, near Mena,
Arkansas, has succeeded in hold-
ing a school together three years
without any of these things. In ad-
dition, they have not campaigned
for a staduim nor asked for
athletic funds.

It is a true labor college this col-
lege in Arkansas. The women wash
the dishes, the men hoe the corn,
and the professor of psychology
waits on table three times a day.
"Hands calloused with honest toil"
is the accepted motto, and no one
seems to mind. The students and
faculty buildings, raise their own
food on "Commonwealth Farm,"
and do their own office work.

Small shops, a garment factory,
a cannery, shingle mill, power plant
and printing shops are being oper-
ated by the college and helping to
work out the economic salvation of
the school.

MARSHALLSHIP

GIVEND. RICH

Receives Honor Appointment
from President Mason

Daniel Catton Rich became a col-
lege marshal yesterday by appoint-
ment of President Max Mason. He
will receive the maroon tassle at once
and serve at the spring convocation.

Rich has maintained a high schol-
arship record throughout his under-
graduate career, his average being ap-
proximately A-. He is a member of
the Dramatis Association, the Poetry
Club, French Club, Italian Club, and
Meadville House. He was a member
of the editorial board of the Circle
and has been active in the amalga-
mation of that magazine with the
Phoenix. For two years he directed
the Freshman plays of the Gargoyles,
has written plays for campus produc-
tion, and with Bertha Ten Eyck James
contributed a number of the lyrics for
the first annual Mirror. Rich is a
frequent contributor of articles on
art subjects of magazines.

The complete list of marshals in-
cludes Allen Heald, Head Marshal;
Edward Ames, William Abbott, Mel-
bourne Boynton, Paul C. Cullom.
Earle English, Allen Miller, Thomas
Mulroy, Daniel C. Rich. Addison Wil-
son and.C. Victor Wisner.

send the show speedily on its way.
The music alloted to them is better
than we find in many of our legiti-
mate houses and is put across in real
style. The melodies were good and
the arrangements were excellent.

If we consider the time allotted to
Director Coleman to stage this show
we must say that his equal would be
hard to find. The dancing of the
chorus was great and the steps were
more complicated and executed with
a greater degree of accuracy than has
been exhibited in the last few years.
This is due to the efforts of a special
coach and by all means may he con-
tinue, as it gives more time to Mr.
Coleman to work with the principals

Bouncing Devils
Bounce No More;

Ankles Unsteady

Twelve hundred first-nighters sat
through the first act of "Wallie Watch
Out" .Friday night, oblivious of the
consternation which took place back-
stage.

Thanks to the efforts of the spot-
light man, some of the audience may
have noticed a queer looking prop
shaped like a bed which was brought
on the stage about the middle of the
act. Some may have connected this
with the fact that in the finale of the
act a number of so-called devils came
bouncing out into space from nowhere
to join the crowd on the stage.

Now, according to the men who
had the fortune, or should we say, mis-
fortune to be backstage, these so-call-
ed devils were forced to jump from
a high platform onto this springboard,
for this is what it was. and from there
to alight gracefully on the stage. But
this is not by any means an easy thing
to do, according to the boys who at-
tempted it. In fact the universal ten-
dency was for the whole quota of
bouncing devils to land in a pile on
the floor.

So it happened Friday night, and
Berry Thomas, who happened to be
on the bottom of the pile, emerged
with a badly sprained ankle. Conse-
quently, those who attend the show
from now on will see no bouncing
devils.

Host At Sales

Theater Pa rty

The Daily Maroon will be hosts at
a theatre party to be given to the team
which sold the most subscriptions dur-
ing Maroon week. Miss Helen Lam-
born was chairman of the winning
team.

The girls composing the team head-
ed by Miss Lamborn were Betty Tay-
lor, Dorothy James, Carol Simons,
I Dorthea Lowenstein, Gertrude
I Holmes, Dorothy Sylvester and Vir-
ginia Hardt.

The subscription contest was part
of the annual Maroon Week held the
first week in April. Other features of
the week were an all University mix-

which was to get the students of the
University better acquainted with their
daily paper.

MRS. A. H. RAMSEY
TO DISCUSS WOMEN

VOTERS AT VESPERS

What has been the influence of the
women voter on the political situa-
tion of the United States? Has she
tended to elevate the moral tone of
politics by her vote? Has she contrib-
uted anything in her capacity of office-
holders? Mrs. A. H. Ramsey, politi-
cal worker, will present her answers
to these questions at the Y. W. C. A.
Vesper services, tomorrow at 4, in
the Y. W. room of Ida Noyes hall.

Mrs. Ramsey is one of the leaders
in the field of politics, and has done
a good deal to establish woman as an
influential element in politics, accord-
ing to Mary Harvey, meetings chair-
man. Mrs. Ramsey was formerly the
chairman of the organization commit-
tee of the League of Women Voters
of the State of Pennsylvania, and now
occupies a similar office in Illinois.

Horace Bridges, president of the
Chicago Ethical Society, will speak on
“Ideals and Character as Shown by
Students,” Wednesday, May 26.

Prof. Gustav Krueger, instructor
of church history at the University of
Giessen, Germany, and known in
theological circles for his hand book
on church history will lecture tonight
at 7:30 in the Commons room of the
Fheology building on “Early Christian
Martyrs.” The lecture is being con-
ducted under the joint auspices of the
New Testament, Church history and
Theology clubs.

Prof. Krueger, who is conducting
two courses in the Divinity school of
the University this quarter—Catholic-
ism, a course given in German, and
Enlightenment, a course in English—
has recently delivered lectures on
phases of church history at Yale, Har-
vard, Columbia and Michigan. Prof.
Krueger is expecting to return to
Germany at the end of the Spring
quarter, and will resume his work at
the University of Giessen next fall.

Classes to be Held

On Decoration Day

Decoration Day, which is celebrated
on May 31st this year, is not a Uni-
versity holiday. This announcement
was officially made by the Recorder’s
office last week. In making the an-
nouncement, Walter A. Payne, Re-
corder and Examiner of the Univer-
sity, cites the action of the General
Administrative Board, April 18, 1914,
which was reenacted October 18. 1924.

Christian Science Monitor
Publishes Journalists
“Chicago” Portraits

A gallery of University of Chi-
cago portraits by Henry Justin Smith,
managing editor of the Chicago Daily
News and author of “Josslyn”, written
after his 18 months on the campus,
appeared in The Christian Science
Monitor yesterday and are continued
in the issues of May 20, 24, and 27.

The sketches are impressions ojf
some of the most loved figures of
the campus as viewed by the person
Mr. Smith calls “the loop-man." The
series has unusual value because of
Mr. Smith’s long experience in the
world of newspaper men, his literary
skill and his fresh approach to cam-
pus life.

"Above the Loop”

When he left the typewriters and
presses of the busy newspaper office
to direct the publicity of the univer-
sity, many eyes watched with interest
the novel situation of a seasoned jour-
nalist at work in academic circles.
To Mr. Smith it was o voyage of dis-
covery. “Ten thousand feet above the
loop,” he called the location of his new
ofiee.

Many things Mr. Smith discovered,
but one he failed to find. That was
the absent-minded professor so dear
to the cartoonists of daily newspapers.
Keen professors he found, amiable pro-
fessors. athletic professors, professors
with an engaging sense of humor and
professors devoted to their researches
to the exclusion of all self-interest, but
the figure of the comics strips he con-
cluded must be mythical.

Reveal University Atmosphere

Just as Mr. Smith’s “Josslyn” and
“Deadlines” were real with, the feel-
ing of a great city of noises and
crowds, so these sketches catch upon

CHICAGO LEADS;

STANFORD DEAN

Cites University as Leader
In Undergrad Activities

That the University of Chicago is
looked upon by other universities and
colleges throughout the country as a
leader in progressive methods for the
undergraduate body was the assertion
made by Prof. George B. Culver, dean
of men at Leland Stanford university
while on campus yesterday.

Prof. Culver stopped at the Uni-
versity to visit some very close friends
including Vice-President F. C. Wood-
ward, who was formerly dean of the
law school at Leland Stanford, and
। President Max Mason. He is on his
I way to visit the leading schools of the
I East, planning studies at Princeton,
j Yale and Hardvard among others af-
ter attending a convention of deans at
the University of Minnesota last week.

The statement made by Prof. Cul-
ver was based upon the program used
Freshman Week and upon the work
of the staff of deans in charge of the
undergraduates at this institution.

SENIOR VAUDEVILLE
ASPIRANTS RECEIVE

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

Officials of the Senior vodvil have
issued a final call to those who wish
to participate. The semi-final try-outs
will be held today in Mande! hall at
3:30.

“It is not expected that aspirants
to the program will present their fin-
ished acts at this time.” said Fred
Handschy, one of the managers.
“What we want,” he continued, “is
some concrete idea of what their pros-
pective act will be about, a written
synopsis. Nor do you have to he a
Senior to enter an act.”

The Senior vodvil plays a somewhat
larger role than merely a class affair
because of the Interscholastic Track
meet. It is expected that a great
many of the entrees will go to the
show as it is scheduled for the Friday
night of the meet. It is planned to use
the vodvil as one of the rushing
attractions, later. The second trvout
for the acts will be announced later.

RETURNS FROM
MOULDY TOMBS
WITH NEW FINDS

Arrives Home After Two
Weeks’ Rest With
Rockefeller

By Milton S. Mayer

James Harvey Breasted is back.

Back from the heart of aged Egypt,
Luxor, Armageddon, the Valley of the
Kings—whose mouldy tombs and
eternal pyramids have yielded the his-
tory of a forgotten world, the re-
nowmed archaelogist reached Chi-
cago yesterday. Mrs. Breasted met
him at New’ York, where he has been
resting for two weeks, the guest of
John D. Rockefeller, Jr.

“Well, it’s warm in Chicago too,”
was the first statement Dr. Breasted
made as he stepped from the 20th
Century iLimited into the Union sta-
tion at 63rd street, where old man
summer drowsily registered a temper-
ature of 85 degrees. Like a fairy story
hero, the hardy Egyptologist is a man
who never grows old. Under his
greying hair and moustache, a bronzed
leathery countenance is illuminated by
eyes that have seen a panorama of un-
told centuries. Dr. Breasted left for
I this latest expedition last fall.

“What’s the news? Perhaps the
best news is inspired by Julius Rosen-
wald. The philanthropist and his son
have given thirty thousand dollars for
the erection of the first scientific li-
brary in upper Egypt. Their gift
marks an epoch in our work. The
library is situated opposite Luxor, fac-
ing the great temple of Medinet Habu.
The Egyptian government, with whom
I am very friendly, has leased us
the ground for one pound—five dollars
—a year.

“With the completion of the Rosen-
wald library, we shall at last be able
to maintain an adequate staff of
Egyptological scholars and workers.
The structure is “lined” with steel,
safe from the attacks of the white
ants that have wrought such incon-
ceivable destruction throughout the
country. We have our own electric
and water systems. The situation is
indeed a Mecca.”

Desert Swallowing Sphinx

When questioned as to the rumors
concerning the decomposition of the
Sphinx. Dr. Breasted told how the
neck of the giant monument was on a
level with the surface of the desert,
and was being eaten away by sand
blasts. “But the Sphinx is safe for a
million years or so. The stone has
been reinforced and protected.”

Dr. Breasted intends to remain in
America for the summer, going east in
July. During the next month he will
be at work, at the Haskell Oriental
Museum, after which he will devote
the rest of the dog-days in complet-
ing a translation of the Edwin Smith

Chicago netmen outclassed Michigan
in individual play to win three out of

meet by a 5 to 4 count. Michigan

Shapinsky, Hudlin and Hall regis-

the match, and as Crane strengthened
his attack, Shapinsky tightened his
defense to keep always in the lead.

easy wins of the Michigan

never did get started and this match
was the biggest upset of the day.

This left the remaining doubles con-
test as the determining match of the
whole meet, and it was hard fought
and more exciting than in the 0-4. 6-2
score might indicate. Schaeffer and
Shapinsky led the first set at 4-3, and
it was only after severaL deuce games
that they were beaten 6-4. The sec-

and Crane copping by 6-2.

To Mr. Prank E. Mandel, whose
activities as an entrepeneur have led
him to float the Sisson Yacht Club,
should be accorded the recognition
that is due of all public-spirited fel-
low’s. Not only did Mr. Mandel throw-
open the doors of his more or less ex-
clusive club to the Blackfriar prin-
cipals last Friday evening, not only
did he give them full freedom to sing
such songs as they were capable, but
he even extended the same privileges
to some others of us whose connection
with the show was more or less re-
mote. (We did not, it is true, avail
ourselves of this opportunity to en-
gage in the role of entertainer, but
still we felt rather gratified that it was
given us, and we did engage in eat-
ing, and other such casual divertisse-
ments as came up).

Not only did Mr. Mandel get the
benefit of my more mellow feelings on
these accounts, but. more. 1 felt for
him almost a brother's feeling when,
after a wavering half-second, he did
not order several of his scurrying
cabin boys to toss me back into the
elevator, lacking as 1 did the envelop-
ing protection of one of the brother’s
tuxedos. This fact, as I say, cut no
ice with the genial Mr. Mandel: he let
it pass, and me with it.

Plan Prep Net
Meet for June

First to Fifth

One more of Chicago’s great an-
nual prep classic is just about due to
turn the corner into the list of June
events. The Twentieth Annual Inter-
scholastic Tennis Tournament of the
University of Chicago has been placed
on schedule for the w'eek of June 1st
to June 5th. Although overshadowed
by the glories and spectacularism of
the big Track Interscholastic the affair
holds a foremost place in the prep net
world and its importance to the prep
athletes is second only to the import-
ance of the track meet.

Annually, for the last twenty years,
the best high school and academy net-
men of the country have come to
compete for the championship at the
University's Interscholastic, and this
year their enthusiasm is running high.
Entries for the tourney will soon be
arriving thick and fast.

Two divisions—for the singles and
the doubles championships—are run
each year, and each year valuable and
beautiful prizes are awrded to the win-
ners. This year cups will be given the
winners and runners-up of each sec-
tion while the third and fourth place
men or teams will receive individual
medals. The meet will be held on the
University courts where the players
will have the finest of footing and the
best of all-around playing conditions.

'Last year first honors in the tourney
were carried off by Emmet Pare, now
a prominent junior in the tennis world.
Tw’O years, ago George Lott, now’ the
nations ranking junior and a student
at the University took the champion-
ship.

Alpha Sigs Forfeit to Pi

Game

Alpha Sigma Phi forfeited to Pi
Lambda Phi in the only unplayed
game yesterday afternoon while the
Phi Sigs, Betas and D. U. were tak-
ing fast contests from their opponents.
Today’s games are the last before the
semi-finals.

Close Contest

Sigma Chi was nosed out in an extra
inning game after tying the score in
the seventh when Scott came in on a
hit by Welty, 5-4. The Sig Chis jump-
ed into an early lead by counting tw’O
runs in the opening frame and one
more in the next.

Then the D. U. hitters began to
find the losing pitcher. Denton, for
some clean hits and the winners
counted two in the second and one
in the third to tie the score.- In the
fifth they again rallied and put an-
other run over the pan. This time
Budlong scored on a single by Eng-
lish.

Play Semi-finals in
Handball Tourney

Handball, the only Winter Quar-
ter sport at present unfinished, w’ill
soon come to a close. There are
now only four men remaining in the
singles tourney, Hendrickson,
Goodman, Elson and Geismann.

Hendrickson and Goodman play
today in the semi-finals for the right
to meet the winner of the Elson-
Geismann match. This latter
match will be played off before the
end of this week and the champ-
ionship of the University should be
decided by the end of next week.

The match carded for today
should be one of the best of the
season for both Goodman and
Hendrickson are in shape and have
been practicing constantly. Good-
man is an all round athlete, playing
on the star Mac horseshoe team as
well as on the ball squad and
touchball team.

IN EASY VICTORY

Badger Elevens in
Scrimmage Today

Madison, Wis.. May 17—Coach Tom
Lieb, former Notre Dame star and
present line coach at the University
of Wisconsin, will be present at the

scrimmage game (scheduled
day between two Wisconsin
elevens. He is hoping to
himself with the squad as he

fer to
football
acquaint
may as-

sume active duties immediately next
fall when he will assist Coach Little.

The game is the second of its kind
this spring and will enable the coaches
to see how the men work under actual
fire. The Badgers have been engag-
ing in intensive drills and as the com-
petition for positions has been un-
usually keen the practice game will
undoubtedly be a spirited one.

The following new men have shown
real possibilities: Kurth, a tackle,
Rose, halfback; Welch, end; Kresge,
fullback; Forman, guard; Van Horn,
halfback; Wagner, center; and Barr,
halfback.

Altogether, there was very nearly as
much of a Blackfriar air to Mr. Man-
del’s establishment as one could well
expect—or want. Abbot Paul Cullom
was there, happy that the week had
at last ended; so was Milt Kreines,
who put out the Friars program. So,
too, were Messrs .Keutzer, Covert and
McGinnis, who sang, much as they
did in the show’. So was Marvin Hintz
who looked customarily naive when
he w’as introduced. And so were Ben
Turner, who runs the Yacht Club or-
chestra and who played the comb in
last year’s Blackfriar show, and Fred'
Von Ammon, who played the accor-
dion last year and this year both; not
only were they there, but they played
the comb and the accordion to the
edification of all concerned.

Before going out after seeing the
Friday night Friar show, I encount-
ered Al Heald. Now, Heald always
is a good man to meet when in need
of advice, as I w’as at the time. I
had somewhere during the evening got
a red rose in my buttonhole. After a
hasty glance in the mirror, I felt some
doubt as to whether the rose was
quite exactly the thing I wanted in my
buttonhole. I could not tell. So I ap-1

PUT IN FIRST BIG
STEEL BEAM FOR

MAROON STADIUM

Stagg Field is beginning to take on
new, rejuvenated, lines and aspects.
The whole north side of the playing
field is being rapidly filled with tiers
upon tiers of seats, the beginnings of
the great structure that will make Chi-
cago’s football plant one of the na-
tions most perfectly equipped. Even
at this early stage the outlines of the
half completed stands suggest vivid
ly the sturdy appearance that ,11^*
bowl will have.

Twelve sections of the seats have
already been completely erected with
the exception of course of the con-
crete filling which will probably be
put in last. The height of the sections
as they stand now is one third of the
final actual height. Yesterday the first
of the gigantic steel beams that will
make the structure solid and safe was
swung into place, rapidly and efficient-
ly, by a huge, powerful derrick.

Still the contractors are two days
behind in their work. But they stake
their reputations on the promise that
the plant will be entirely completed
by the first part of September.

Phi Sigs Win, 7-4

The Phi Sigs—apportioned their runs
rather evenly inning by inning and
finally won out 7-4. The Tekes fought
stubbornly and promised big things
in a last inning rally which was how-
ever nipped after two runs had been
scored. Tau Kappa Epsilon was held
to seven hits but through daring base
running they were able to convert the
majority of them into runs.

The winners hit the ball more free-
ly, gathering twelve safe blows. The
Phi Sigs began to score in the second
when hits by Gordon, Weil, Edelstein
and Goodman accounted for two runs.
In the fourth Gordon and Fox scored,
and Reinwald’s run in the fifth won
the game.

Betas Outhit Tau Delt

Beta Theta Pi outhit the Tau Ddts
to win, 13-11. Both teams were minus
the usual quota of men, the Tau Delts
having one less than their opponents.
The game w’as not decided until the
final inning when the winners pushed
over three counters to overcome the
Tau Delt lead and win the game.

This was after the Tau Delts had
come from behind and scored seven
runs in their last inning to take the
lead by one counter, 11-10. Engberg
made four runs for the winners.

Varsity and Frosh

Today and Wednesday, from 11:30
to 12:30, two track meets for varsity
and freshman track athletes will be
held on Stagg Field. Today will wit-
ness the running of the 220. the half,

Makes 6% Ft. in Four Way
Track Meet

Although Chicago’s Showing as a
team was very unimpressive, Anton
Burg, the Maroons’ one track ace,
came through with flying colors in the
quadrangular track meet between Ohio
State, Wisconsin, Northwestern and
Chicago last Saturday. Burg’s colors
flowed higher than usual for he as-
cended the barrier at 6 feet 6 inches
in the high jump, and that is about as
high as humans are able to attain
through their own locomotion now-a-
days, in days past, and it would not
be bold to say, in days to come.

Burg was sorely pressed for Anson
of Ohio State did not quit until he
had climbed over for 6 feet 5 inches
and could do no more. McGinnis of
Wisconsin, who is also a high jumper
of some repute, was unable to keep
up with his inspired fellow aerialists.
This trio was the same one that went
to the Penn relays some time ago and
showed the east a few tricks about
high-jumping.

Otherwise, as remarked before, it
was a rather drab meet for Chicago
who finished last and finally in this
gathering of trackmen. Ohio State
nosed out Wisconsin by a point for the
team honors while Northwestern
made a respectable showing.

By Harry L. Shlaes

Avenging’lhe stinging defeats ad-
ministered in tennis and track last
weekend, the Maroon golf squad sent
home the Ohio State four on the short
end of a 19-2 score yesterday after-
noon at course 3 of Olympia. The
lonely two pointers engineered by the
visitors were accomplished in the final
doubles match between the Patterson-
Dorsey twosome and the King-Steph-
ens combination, when the latter an-
nexed the last nine holes of the match.

Make Six Birdies

In the morning round all matches
were Maroon complete victories ex-
cept one, and thot was almost as com-
plete as the others. Dorsey was the
one who lost the only point in the
morning’s play when he halved the
first nine of his match with Stephens.

Hisert defeated C. King, taking
both nines and the match and three
markers for the locals, while Bartlett
did the same with W. Hagen. Patter-
son again repeated the feat of his
captain and took the measure of G.
King for three pointers, registering
a 75 for the eighteen holes, just five
over a difficult par 70.

Lead lv-0 At Noon

The afternoon round was marked by
wonderful shooting on the part of both
squads. Three times in the eighteen
holes of the Hisert-Bartlett vs. C.
King-Hagen match the losers pulled
birdies only to have them tied with
like birdies to the credit of the Ma-
roons, thus halving the holes after
the Bucks were almost sure of win-
ning them. The locals took home six
birdies in that round, just three more
than those of their opponents and won
the match, 3-0. This left the score
at 17-0 and the Bucks were in dan-
ger of being whitewashed.

Patterson and Dorsey halved their
match with G. King and Stephens,
winning the first nine and losing the
second to halve the entire eighteen,
making the score 2-2 and saving the
Buck squad from being scoreless.

The feature of the day was the play-
ing of Hisert and Bartlett in their
doubles match wherein their combined
medal score for the eighteen was 68,
two under par.

uary, we conduct a Special,
complete, intensive three-
months course in stenography
which ia open to

COLLEGE
GRADUATES AND
UNDERGRADUATES

ONLY

Enrollments for this course
must be made before the open-
ing day—preferably some time
in advance, to be sure of a
place in the class.

Stenography opens the way
to Independence, and is a very
great help in any position in
life. The ability to take short-
hand notes of lectures ser-
mons, conversations, and in
many other situations is a
great asset.
