While the campus decks itself for
the 1926 Alumni Reunion, the Chi-
cago" Alumni club will start the ball
of activity rolling with its annual
banquet scheduled for 6 o’clock this
evening at. the Hotel LaSalle.

Tonight’s affair will be honored
with the presence of President Max
Mason. He will address the associa-
tion on the past and future of the
University. The other speakers and
guests of honor are Vice-President
Woodward, Vice-President Sterre, Di-

Norgren and his ball team.

Expect Over 200

More than two hundred alumni
are expected to attend the occasion,
at which officers for the coming year
will be elected. William H. Lyman,
’14, will officiate as retiring presi-
dent. Roderick MacPherson, ’16, is
secretary of the club. Plans for 1927
activities of the organization will be
discussed, with the view of inspiring
a more solid support of University >

grads.”

Further features of this year’s re-
union were announced yesterday by
Adolph G. Pierrot, of the University
. Alumni office. “Every effort is be-
ing made to make this reunion one
that will live in the annals of the
campus as an epoch, and one that

When a mouse gets loose in a
fraternity house and runs amuck
the affair is simply looked upon as
an idiosyncrasy of the house cat,
but when one gets loose in Foster
hall things begin to happen. At
least this seemed to be the case
yesterday afternoon when a mis-
chevious rodent of the climbing
variety disturbed the bliss of the
second floor front of Foster.

It seems that the mouse had
gotten into Ruth Holmes’ cracker
box and when Ruthie got hungry
and opened the lid she found the
bleary eyed little rascal partaking
of the soda bits. Violent screams.
Screams. In the twinkling of an
eye the room was filled with young
women. They held their skirts
high above their heads, holding
down the lid of the box and
screaming for help. When at last
the naive little rodent made its es-
cape the women returned to their
rooms after making an inventory
to see that the mouse was no-
where on their persons.

SUMMER GARB
FOR CLASS HOP

Plan Five Hours of Dancing
Grand March at 10

Because the Interclass Hop is go-
ing to be held in such an outdoor,
springlike, garden party setting,
summer formal dress has been de-
creed for the occasion. Light dresses
for the women, and light flannels,
dark coats and soft shirts for the
men are the order of the evening.
It’s all designed with the purpose of
making the Hop a lighter, freer and
happier occasion than the more stiff

dances which have
of the social year.
Dancing will run
nine to two—with

studded the rest

five hours—from
time out for the ■

Grand March and such refreshments
as happen to be about. The March
is scheduled for 10 o’clock. John Mc-
Donough, who is leading the sopho-

more wing with Betsy

order, for he
train to Co-

The fraternity allotments, which
disposed of some 170 tickets, are go-
ing fast, but Graham, of the Hagey
brothers combination, announces
that there are about twenty-five bids
left for such non-fraternity men,
alumni or unclassified as have the
five dollars and the inclination.

Plans are progressing on a Hop
Maroon, with George Morgenstern
and George Koehn in charge. It will
be eight pages, will have cuts of
the leaders, the band, and whatever
other principals there are.

“Sub-deans” for freshmen was the
main topic of consideration at the
meeting of the Undergraduate Coun-
cil yesterday. The new plan is based
on the desire of the Council to fol-
low through the work started in
Freshman Week by continued advice
and direction of new students.

The system will be based on choice
of upper classmen, to be appointed
as “sub-deans,” to act in much the
same capacity as that of the college
marshals in advising freshmen about
their participation in activities and to
acquaint them generally with the
realities and routine of campus life.
They will also be expected to advise
the new students about their scholas-
tic work, aiding them to plan their
courses and selecting their field of
study.

Choice On Records

These student deans will be chos-
en because of their good records in
scholarship and activities, and will
be appointed in the same way that
the marshals and aides are now se-
lected.

John Howe has been appointed
chairman of a committee to consider
the scheme more fully, to elaborate
upon it and work out the details. It
has not been formally adopted as
yet, but the committee expects to
see the plan completed and ready
for the approval of the Council with-
in a few days.

Howe Praises Plan

Howe, chairman of the committee,
believes that this arrangement will
see a great improvement in the meth-
ods of taking care of entering stu-
dents, and giving them good direc-
tions during their firsts months.

‘This plan will not only take a
number of unnecessary details from
the faculty advisors, but will also be
a more intimate and direct way of

reaching the freshmen.

Blue Key, the national intercollegi-

AN INTERCHOLATIC FOR CHICAGO

JHERE has been much moaning in the past about the rushing done
1 at the yearly University of Chicago interscholastics to induce the
high school boys to come here—and to Illinois, Northwestern, and
all the other colleges who are out looking for bright young athletes
willing to begin at the bottom. The situation at some of the meets,
indeed, was so bad that it gave rise to the plaintive bleat that Chi-
cago’s interscholastics seemed especially designed for the rushing
of the high school boys to every school except Chicago. Such a sit-
uation, the elders were inclined to agree, was very nearly insuffer-
able; something must be done about it.

A permanent commission, therefore, was established last year
to rush the contestants, but so limited was the number of these hand-
graspers and so large the number of the high school lads, that, al-
though collegiate collars wilted right and left, there was little to show
for it when returns from the precincts came in. Even so, it was felt
matters had altered in the right direction. Something, at least, was
being done about things.

This year thirty men, one in each fraternity house, have been
appointed by the rushing committee to do the fell work that one now
and then hears rushers do. These fellows will be responsible for the
rushing given the high school boys lodged at their houses during
the meet. They will meet the athletes at the depot, bring them out
south in geloppes along Chicago’s beautiful boulevard system, point
out to them the witchery of the stockyards, tell each of the athletes
that the bed he is getting is the best in the house, and see that the
boys are well supplied with jam and pickles at the table. In all these
and many more ways will the rushers convince the high school lads
that Chicago men are the salt of the earth, and the dear old univer-
sity the place, which, because it can’t turn out all the salt, only turns
out the best. That, at least, is the theory of the thing.

On the face of it, it looks very like an exceedingly good plan.
It is as elaborately idealistic as John Locke’s proposed South Caro-
lina constitution, and it is, in addition, founded on a basis as solid
as the Rock of Ages. So good is it, indeed, that we have but one
suggestion to add to it—that a strongarm squad be appointed to lie
in wait around the locker room doors to bludgeon down I and
“N” sweater men before they can get in and seduce the high school
boys away. If this is done, we see no reason for not passing our
nights in peaceful sleep from now till the interscholastic is over.

SPRING FOOTBALL

PRACTICE CLOSES
NEXT WEEKEND

Several Look to Numerals
As May 28 Comes
Near

Next Friday, a week from tomor-
row, will bring the close of this
spring’s football practise. The an-
nouncement that the annual prelim-
inary grid session will formally close
on that date was made yesterday
by Coach Stagg. The preparation
this year has been gone through with
the usual thoroughness and as a re-
sult some new material has been un-
covered.

The training this year also served
another purpose—that of trying out
the new practise schedule which will
go into effect among all of the Big
Ten schools this fall. At their last
meeting the conference officials made
a resolution limiting each day’s prac-
tise to two hours. So this spring
Coach Stagg has tried crowding all
of the training into two hours daily,
thus making sure that the most will
be made of the two hours next fall.

A number of men will be awarded
their numerals as a result of their
work this spring. The coaches have
not made any announcement concern-
ing it but it is expected that several
of the men will get the coveted
awards.

Most of the practice periods of
the last two weeks have been oc-
cupied by scrimmage drills. Two
teams have been selected and engage
in daily battles of a mid-grid season
atmosphere. Scrimmage will fill the
bill for the remaining days, and will
terminate in a big game on a week
from Friday. This game will be run
off in regular style with referees,
timekeepers, linesmen and all, includ-
ing spectators.

Spring football is annually grow-
ing in interest with the grid fans, and
the games which close the season are
being looked forward to as big events
on the spring sports calendar. The
line-ups for the two teams that will
battle on the final day, have not been
determined, but will be chosen at the
opening practice next week to give
each team ample time to work out its
attack, perfect its play, and learn the
signals. The Old Man, Crisler, Dick-
son, and Stagg, Jr. will (put the
teams through preparatory work.

This game will serve to throw a
light on the much discussed grid sit-
uation and the coming season, for
the new material, which is so much
depended on for next year’s chances;
constitutes practically the entire
spring squad.

Predict Big Year for Maroon

Athletes in 1926-1927 Season

Although it is still too early to
make predictions as to the fortunes
of Maroon teams for the coming year
all indications point to the year
1926-27 as a banner year in Maroon
athletic history. The cross-country
team next fall should be one of the
best in the Big Ten with such star
performers as Jimmy Cusack, Dick
Williams, Wake Burke, Reitan, and
Dugan. Prospects for a football title
are not especially bright, but the sit-
uation is not as gloomy as has been
painted. The backfield is strong with
Marks, McKinney, Rouse, Drain and
Duval and the line though not as
heavy as in past years is far from
light. Only the lack of capable re-
serves will keep Chicago from being
a leading contender for champicnship
honors.

The basketball team with five reg-
ulars back and a bevy of classy subs
supplemented by some sterling per-
formers from last year’s frosh should
make a powerful bid for premier
honors. Sackett, Zimmerman, Mc-
Donough, Hoerger, Marks, Farwell,
and Macklind are back in addition

Stan Rouse Eligible;

Maroon Begs Pardon

Stan Rouse, who was said to be
ineligible in yesterday’s Maroon,
is not ineligible, it was announced
by the Bureau of Rc “ords this
mrning. Only a $6.25 library fine
stood between him and eligibility
but that has been taken care of.

So Rouse is now eligible to do
what he may for the cause of the
track team. His coaches were de-
pressed by the news, and thought
that he would be unable to throw
the discus at Minneapolis Satur-
day. The Maroon’s source of in-
formation yesterday was inclined
to exaggerate matters slightly and
the Maroon wishes to beg the par-
don of all those concerned for the
over-statement of actual condi-
tions.

OUTDOOR TRACK

WILL BE CLOSE

Iowa, Indoor Champs Will
Have Hard Time

That Iowa, indoor Conference
champion, is going to have a much
harder time taking the outdoor meet
at Iowa City May 29 grows increas-
ingly apparent as the spring track
season progresses. Both Illinois and
Michigan have beaten the Hawks in
dual meets since the schools have
taken to the outdoor cinders, and
both times the margins were pretty
decisive.

Th? Conference meet looks like a
three-team battle, with Michigan the
best prospect to take the title, Illi-
nois next in line, and Iowa a good
third. Wisconsin has an outside
chance to crash into the first three
places, but it isn’t much better than
that.

Michigan is much stronger out-
doors than inside. The Wolverines
will pick up points in the sprint
events that were not on the indoor
card, and in the javelin, broad jump,
and discus in the field events. Lesch-
insky, Hester and Kelly are all good
sprint point prospects, while the
Maize and Blue is exceptionally
strong in the new outdoor weight
events.

Northrup, champion last year, is
again the class in the javelin, and
he has a good chance of breaking
in on the broad jump points. Doyle
and Schravesand are among the three
best discus men in the Conference,
Hawkins has the best mark in the
hammer so far, Prout has come
through amazingly well in the pole
vault, and Munz is going good in the
shot.

'fl

to Gist and Kaplan from last year’s
yearling squad. The swimming team
should also be among the leaders
with Cornelius Oker, the prep sensa-
tion on the varsity squad to help
out Capt. Noyes.

As for the Dan Hoffer’s gym team,
with only one missing from last
year’s national championship team,
the Maroons have the gym title prac-
tically won now. Merrill predicts a
versatile fancing team. Vorres’
grapplers will include many po-
tential conference champions includ-
ing Krogh, 175 lb champion.

Indoor track will find Chicago up
among the leaders for this year’s
freshman team was the best since the
war. Coach Stagg may have a rec-
ord breaking four mile relay time
with such milers as Cusack, Burke,
Gist and Williams. All can reel oT the
mile in about 4:25. In addition all
four can make below two minutes in
the 880. Burg is back in the high
jump and will be helped by Frey, a
freshman, who has leaped 6 feet 2
inches in practice.

Big Ten Nines in
Crucial Contests
During the Week

This week is an important one in
deciding the Big Ten championship.
All the teams are scheduled to play,
| with some of the leaders meeting
each other.

Michigan is comfortably in the
lead with but one loss and seven
victories. Wisconsin has only drop-
ped two and won five while Illinois
follows with a like number of wins
but has three defeats to her ledger.

The Iowa-Minnesota game today is
of hardly any worth as a title battle
as both teams are well down on the
bottom, Iowa having failed to come
through with a victory- as yet. Ohio
State should worry the leading
Michigan nine on Friday. Miller and
Jablonski have been pitching superb
ball for the Wolverines but they are
due to crack. Ohio State has a bet-
ter than .500 percentage to date.

On Saturday Michigan’s mettle will
be again tried, this time by the Il-
linois team. Illinois’ chances depend
upon this game and they will un-
doubtedly attempt to make the most
of it. Wisconsin will also be in a
crucial position when they play at
Evanston against the weak Purdue
nine. In the other games of the day
Indiana will journey to Minneapolis
to engage the Gophers in an obscure
contest while the Maroons will take
on Purdue on the local lot.

W. A. A. SPONSORS
SPRING HIKE THIS

SATURDAY MORNING

W. A. A. is sponsoring its third
spring hike this Saturday from 8:30
to 4. Meeting in the foyer of Ida
Noyes hall at 8:30 the women will
take cars to Palos park and from
there will hike to the new W. A. A.
lodge located about a mile and a half
from the station. All members who
have not seen the lodge should not
miss this opportunity of doing so,
according to Annette Allen who is in
charge of the hike. It5 also affords
a highly enjoyable way of earning
points towards membership in the or-
ganization.

Plans for the best way in which
to utilize the twenty acres of ground
around the lodge are being decided
uponby the officers of the organiza-
tions. It has definitely been decided
that there will be a croquet court, a
baseball diamond, and perhaps a ce-
ment tennis court. Other sports
which the location of the lodge of-
fers are hiking, golf and horse-back {
riding.

The second round of tennis
matches in the tennis tournament
should be played off by Friday, or
be lost by default. Winners in the
tournament will also win W. A. A.
points. There will be a women’s
swimming meet held in Ida Noyes
tank this Friday afternoon in which
all classes will participate.

Friday next, with consent of Old
Sol and Nature in general, the local
net men will engage in a raquet con-
test with the Wisconsin players. Al-
though Doc Reed is not yet sure who
the men playing in the five single
tourneys and two doubles will be, he
plans to use Shapinsky at the lead.
Captain Schaefer, Hudlin, Drain and
Hall will take care of the remaining
four sets, while the combinations of
Shapinsky and Shaefer and Hudlin
and Hall will face the Cardinals in
the doubles play.

Conference Meet May 27

This is to be the last match before
the Conference Tournament which is
to begin Thursday the 27th and the
two following days. The men have
been carefully coached by Doc Reed
in the finer points of the game, es-
pecially in footwork and overhead
tactics.

The tennis team has won one
match against three losses to Ohio,
Illinois and Michigan. In the con-
test against Michigan the local men
lost by only one match, which was
indeed a hard fought affair. The
Maroon win against Northwestern |
showed what the boys were able fo
do when in real shape; and knowing
that they can play a good game, Doc
Reed is anticipating a number of
victories in the coming tournament.

Meet Purple

Another match has been arranged
with Northwestern, but the date set
for it, June 3, has been changed. The
match will either be indefinitely
postponed or be pushed up a week.
The campus raqueteers are anxious
to face the Wildcats once more so as
to assure them of their strength.

Illinois and Ohio State are the
leaders in the tournament schedule
having the least number of losses on
their cards. Wallie Schaefer’s team-
mates have however improved to a

great degree and their upsetting
Ohio State in the tournament would
not come as a surprise. There is a
great deal of danger of course in
the frequent downpours of this week,
which have prevented the men from
having real workouts. If Spring es-
tablishes itself definitely and allows
the men to use the courts, the Ma-
roons will have the best of chances
to turn the tables and take a place
in the lead.

Have Good Chance

Were it not for the ineligibility
of George Lott, the local men would
have all titles in the coming tourna-
ment cinched, but the campus can
console itself in knowing that the
men on the present team have a
great opportunity to reach the top of
the ladder by themselves.

BUCKSPURCHASE

GRIDIRON COVER

Also Use Cover for Ball and
Track Fields

Following the nation-wide public-
ity given the’ recent purchase of a
huge canvas cover for the Univer-
sity of Illinois Gridiron, many other
institutions have, followed suit and
waterproofed their precious football
fields.

According to the Buck authorities,
Ohio State University has gone one
or two steps further In the purchase
of a specially designed cover which
will not only safeguard the football
field, but can be equally adapted to
use on the baseball, track, and tennis
grounds.

This cover will in this way assure
spring sports as well as the great
fall pastime, and this is a valuable
point, as the greatest part of the
rainy weather comes at this time. It
is made in strips, with a patent de-
vice for connecting the parts that
are needed to cover the particular
ground space that is to be protected.
It is constructed of specially treated
canvas material.

This new idea in sport insurance
against rainy weather is fast becom-
ing recognized by leading univer-
sities, and is expected to solve the
mud question of the outdoor sports.
By keeping the field dry up until the
time for the game, most of the dis-
advantage of a rainy day is solved,
for the playing in the rain is not so
bad. It is the mud that hurts.

Champs, Enter

Meet

Entries for the second annual In-
tramural spring festival have begun
to come in to the Intramural office
in Bartlett gym. According to Bill
Weddell, who is manager of the af-
fair, it is important that the organ-
izations get their teams lined up at
once so that the entry lists can be
checked over in advance of the Fes-
tival which occurrs on Thursday and
. Friday afternoons, May 27th and
28th.

Delta Sigs Enter

Although the championship Delta
Sigma Phi team has entered its star
quartet consisting of Gaskill, Har-
rington and the Faris brothers, the
team that wins this year will be the
team that gets the most men out say
the Intramural officials who back up
their statement with the news that
five places will count in the scoring.
Eleven events will be on the program
for the festival: 50 yard dash, 100
yard dash, 220, 440, 880, mile, high
jump, broad jump, 12 lb. shot put,
120 yard low hurdles, and 880 yard
relay.

“The pole vault, high hurdles, dis-
cus and javelin were left out because
those events are ones that require
too great a degree of skill and experi-
ence,” said Weddell. “The elimina-
tion of these events will give every
organization an equal chance, and
combined with the fact that five
places in each event will count for
points it insures a tough battle for
the championship with an equal start
for every organization.”

Last Meet On Stagg

This will be the last meet to be
held on the present Stagg Field, it
being necessary to delay the tearing
up of the famous track in order to
accommodate the intramural depart-
ment and further the interest of in-
tra-campus athletics.

WHEW!

Dear Atlas:

I, too, feel the necessity of enter-

women. But, I do not feel capable

son at a time and felt the necessity
of selecting an adversary.

You, yourself, are not much bet-

and a periodical mustache. Age,

saintly men’s dormitories. Activities,
Y. M. C. A. committees and the writ-
ing of nasty little poewms.

You think you know all about
women, the common delusion of cal-
law uni^rsity boys. As you are
goodlooking, your cowy eyes and
silly verses have probably caused sev-
eral of my weaker sisters to give
themselves to you. So you smile
knowingly and proclaim loudly that
all women are alike. And you go
around bearing your mustache proud-
ly and prating of your sophisitica-
tion.

Just because high school children,
waitresses, and parlormaids have
proved no match for you, don’t think
al! women are alike. Wait a few
years, learn a little more, and then,
much older and wiser, let me know
your opinion.

In the meantime, my friend, you
are furnishing much delightful

prite verse:

THE HATERS

I hate you most tremendously,
1 hate the very ground you tread,
1 hate with great intensity
Your hands, your eyes, your face,
your head.

I even hate the things you think,
And deeper hate the things you do.
I hate to eat, I hate to sleep,
Because you do the same things too.
I hate to hear you, heat to hear
The things that do your hate beget.
I hate you so much now I fear
I’ll even hate to hate you yet.

Dear Stevie:

Women are like a vocal high C—
very few of them are beautiful, and
they are hard to maintain on wind.
In a short time they become an acute

Say, Atlas:

Pardon me — I’ve changed my
mind. Men are not so much like

GOING to the same places and doing the
same things vacation after vacation be-
comes monotonous.

Step away from the commonplace this sum-
mer—experience the thrill of adventure, the
exotic joy of visiting another world with its
different people, different customs, different
scenery.

AND the bigger they are, the harder they fall,
as Shakespeare or somebody said. You can
prove this beyond question with a jimmy-pipe
and a tidy red tin of Prince Albert. Any time.
Anywhere. As a matter of fact, tackling pipe-
grouches is P. A.’s regular busmess.

Cool and sweet and fragrant, P. A.’s wonder-
ful smoke comes curling up the pipe-stem,
filling your system with a new brand of pipe-
pleasure. You smoke—and smile! For the first
time in your life, you’ve found the one tobacco
that scales to your blueprint of bliss.

Slow or fast, no matter how you feed it, P. A.
never bites your tongue or parches your throat.
Those important items were taken care of in
the original plans by the Prince Albert process.
Get yourself a tidy red tin of this friendly tobacco
today.
