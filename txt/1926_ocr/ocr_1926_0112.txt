DEAN IN HOSPITAL FROM OVERWORK

JORDAN TELLS
HOW SCIENCE

FIGHTS FEVER

University Bacteriologist De-
scribes Progress of Science
in Recent Years

Successful drives, in both the lab-
oratory and the clinical fields, which
have immensely reduced the death rate
in many of the deadly diseases were
reviewed by Dr.\ Edwin Oakes Jor-
dan, chairman of the Department of
Bacteriology at the University in a
public lecture last evening at Orches-
tra hall.

Under the title “The Conquest of
Disease,’ Dr. Jordan, who is one of
the most widely known bacteriologists
and health authorities in the United
States, described the impressive prog-
ress made by mankind during the last
few decades in combatting disease,
particularly such scourges as typhoid,
diphtheria, malaria and scarlet fever.

Describes Medical Warfare

Having illustrated processes and
effects through this discussion of
diphtheria. Dr. Jordan took up the
warfare waged, in America and
throughout the world, upon that dis-
ease, and also upon tuberculosis, ty-
phoid, malaria and scarlet fever. He
showed by means of charts displayed
on stereopticon slides just what curve
the death rate from tuberculosis in
the United States * took during the
years from 1812 to 1911.' The chart
showed at a certain point, at about 1885
a sudden drop in the death rate, con-
tinuing more or less consistently. That
point when the death rate began to
“toboggan” came with the discovery
of the tubercule bacillus—a discovery

WINNER OF CONTEST
TO BE ANNOUNCED AT
SONG FEST THURSDAY

“Sing-a-ma-jig” for all university
women will be held under the auspices
of W. A. A. Thursday at 3:30 in the
main gymnasium of Ida Noyes hall.
This affair has been planned for the
pleasure of all university women who
enjoy singing and for those who would
like to learn the best-known college
songs.

Mrs. Charles Robbins, accompanied
by her daughter, Helen, will lead the
sing. She will be recognized by a
great number of women as the song
leader in the various gymnasium class-
es last quarter. Upperclass women
may remember her from former years.
At this time the announcement of the
prize winner of the song contest con-
ducted by W. A. A. will be made. ‘ We
consider ourselves very fortunate that
Mrs. Robbins has consented to at-
tend,” said Eleanor Fish, president of
the organization.

FEDERATION GREETS
NEW WOMEN TODAY

Presidents, of the three women’s or-
ganizations, Y. W. C. A., W. A. A.,
Mid Federation, will speak informally
at a tea to be sponsored by Federation
today from 4 to 6 in the Y. W. C. A.
room of Ida Noyes hall.

“The purpose of this tea is to ac-
quaint the entering women with other
women on the campus and to endeavor
to create a spirit of friendliness be-
tween the women. It is thought that
gathering around the fire in the Y.
W. C. A. room will give an excellent
opportunity to the women to become
acquainted with each other,” said Bet-
ty LeMay, chairman of the publicity
committee. Women have been urged
to attend with their upper class coun-
cillors.

Borneo Pygmies
Without Beauty

Aids Says Cole

Every man is his own architect and
every woman her own modiste among
the pygmies on the island of Palawan
north of Borneo, according to Prof.
bay-Cooper Cole, anthropologist of
the University, who described this
group of people in a radio lecture last
Friday night through The Daily News
station, WMAQ.

“There are no beauty parlors, per-
manent waves arc permanent, and fa-
cial creams are quite unknown,” Prof.
Cole said. But the pygmies beautify
their bodies with scars from self-
inflicted wounds.

Most of the food supply comes from
hunting, and all the members of a
Pygmy settlement share alike, no mat-
ter who kills the game. Their society
is almost entirely communistic with-
out private property or ownership of
land.

They are very low in the scale even
of primitive peoples, according to the
lecturer, who cited the Palawan trible
to illustrate the definite facts which
modern sciences has been able to learn
about the infancy of the human race.

Ancient Flints Found to Date

Back One-hundred Thousand Yrs.

A thousand pieces of flint, chipped
by the hand of primitive man, and
brought to the University of Chicago
from Egypt by Dr. James H. Breasted,
noted Egyptologist, have been classi-
fied in a study made for the depart-
ment of anthropology by Miss I.ouise
Cross and have been found to date
back at least to the palaeolithic era
from 50,000 to 100,000 years ago.

Dr. Breasted’s discovery of these
flints was one of the things leading to
his request to the General Education
Board of New York for additional
funds with which to carry on excava-
tions in the caverns of the Nile to de-
termine the chronological sequence
and parallel development of prehistoric
man in Egypt. Miss Cross’s work is
the first effort made at the University
of Chicago to record evidence of pre-
historir craftsmanship from the The-

New Chute Stops
Maiming of Books

At Harper E-ll

E-ll books will have better care,
will be rebound less often and will be
in better condition generally in con-
sequence of the enlarged chute for the
return of books which was just com-
pleted, according tn Mr. E. A. Henry,
head of the Readers’ department of
the University libraries.

The improved return chute was built
to facilitate handling books on the
part both of students and library em-
ployees. With the old return system,
no more than about a dozen books
could be placed in the chute at the
same time, said Mr. Henry. A pass-
ing student, in a hurry to get his
book back on time, would thrust it
against the line already filling the
opening and this final push would be
enough to break the binding of sev-
eral of the books. Some of the smaller
and lighter books would fall to the
floor because nothing had been con-
structed to keep them on ‘the table at
the base of the chute.

Four times as many books may now
be accommodated by the remodeled
chute. This, said Mr. Henry, means
less harsh treatment for them, and a
preservation of the 'bindings. A rail-
ing has also been built to prevent
books from falling from the table if
they have been thrown down with too
I much force.

THOMAS, POOLE,
FOX, REED RUN
IN FROSH RACE

Holmes, Good, and Eckhart
Named for Class

Vice-Presidency

Freshman class officers will be elect-
ed in chapel next Monday. The nom-
inations were made at a meeting fol-
lowing Freshman chapel yesterday.
Addison Wilson, representative of the
Undergraduate Council presided.

The nominees for president are:
George Reed, Perry Thomas. Clarence
Fox, and George Poole. Those nom-
inated for vice-president are Violet
Holmes, Janet Goode and Charlotte
Eckhart. Carol Simons and Dorothy
Frame were nominated for secretary,
and Rainey Bennett, Harry Bradley,
Donald McGuineas, Harry Hagey and
Frank Carson were nominated for
treasurer.

Withdrawals from the race must be
made in writing before the end of this
week, and other candidates may be
submitted with in the same length of
time if a written petition is presented
signed by five members of the fresh-
man class.

ban heights.

Louise Cross Makes Analysis

By comparison with findings of Eu-
ropean archeologists and study of the
various types of flint in the collection.
Miss Cross has been able to conclude
that the University’s collection “shows
at least some upper palaeolithic as well
as undoubted lower palaeolithic char-
acteristics,” and that “it is of extreme
antiquity.” Moreover, marked similar-
ity has been found between the Egyp-
tian flints and those discovered in Eu-
rope hy scholars in Continental fields.
The former have characteristics iden-
tical with those of the European Chet-
lean, and Moustercian epochs.

Miss Cross continues: “Tn Egypt
Dr. Breasted has gone over the avail-
able material and has published the
results in his articles on ‘Origins of
Civilization’. The same flints were evi-
dently washed down from the heights
and deposited before the Nile began
to fall in its level and to develop from
the lacarstrine stage into river with
sufficient current for cutting down the
present river terraces. They are em-
bedded in great numbers in the rock
of the upper river terraces, which was
hard enough in the Eleventh dynasty
(2160 to 2000 B. C.), to be excavated
for tombs.

Flints Indicative of Culture

“Even if the cutting did not occur
until the second interglacial period of
Europe—based on prabable relations
between the pluvial of Africa and the
glacial of Europe—these flints are con-
siderably older, and must antedate
any certain dating of European arti-
facts.'

ELECT EIGHT WOMEN
TO MAROON STAFF

Three sophomore women have been
elected to the staff of The Daily Ma-
roon as sophomore editors. Madge
Child, Betty McGee and Doris Mode,
will fill these positions until the end
of the spring quarter when formal elec-
tions frill be held.

Marie Gtilpern, Harriett Harris,
Harriet Lemon, Kathryn Sandmeyer,
and Irma Selz are the five freshmen
who will be retained as reporters.

Freshman women who wish to try
for staff positions may meet with Ger-
trude Bromberg, woman’s editor, any
day from 2:30 to 3:30 in The Daily
Maroon office.

Experiment Upon
Maroon 'Athletes

With Violet Ray

College football like ultra-modern
wars may be waged in the laboratory
with the aid of test tubes and micro-
scopes, if the highly unique ideas buzz-
ing in the brain of Simon Benson, new
University athletic trainer, work out
into facts. Benson, who in addition
to his capacities as a guide to Maroon
athletes, has the added distinction of
bemg a chemist, plans to work out
some of his theories in tlK training
quarters.

He is interested mainly in the action
of ultra-violet rays on the human body
and he intends to find out exactly how
they work and why. He intends to
study the treatment he gives the Ma-
roon warrior with the ultra-violet ray
equipment in Bartlett gymnasium and
then report his findings to the chem-
istry laboratory. Wherever the results
hold possibilities of improving the con-
dition of the body, they will be applied
to the athlete. Thus both pure science
and applied science will benefit, Ben-
son points out.

“Many of the beneficial effects of
ultra-violet rays are known to science,
but there is much to be uncovered,”
says Benson. “The training quarters
where individuals are treated daily
with therapeutic light afford an excel-
lent laboratory in which to carry on in-
vestigations. I am interested specifi-
cally in the action of light on food;
to what -extent it will produce vita-
m*ts and so forth.

“If the studies turn out successfully
(and all scientific matters are extreme-
ly problematical), we shall attempt to
apply what we have learned to athletic
training, thereby allowing athletes to
benefit from the theoretical problems
of pure science, and as light has been
shown to have a very pronounced ef-
fect on certain foods, it is obvious that
the two subjects have a very definite
relationship and that one can supple-
ment the other.”

It is believed that Benson is the
first theoretical scientist to be added
to a university athletic staff. He con-
troverts the popular notion that train-
ing quarters arc habituated by rough
and ready gentlemen who wear iron
hats and jerseys and who know as
much about anatomy as Babe Ruth
or Harry Wills.

Select Recipients
Of Henry Strong -

Scholarship Award

Eight students of the University,
twice as many as are usually honored,
have been chosen by Dean Ernest
Hatch Wilkins to receive the Henry
Strong scholarship, given by the
Henry Strong Educational Founda-
tion. They are Jeanette Baldwin. W.
H. Abbott, Helen Wooding, Mel-
bourne Boynton, Lois Gilldnders and
Hugh Allen Miller, all of whom have
received the $250 scholarship. Two
other students, Harry Ziggler and
Jack Langford, have received individ-
ual scholarships of $125.

These scholarships offer aid to stu-
dents who have not only high grades
but also such characteristics as will
tend to leadership and traits proving
the student worthy of receiving this
honor. General Henry Strong is the
donor of the scholarship.

Usually only four students are se-
lected by Dean Wilkins to receive the
scholarship, but because of the unusual
work of the eight students mentioned
above, all of them have been presented
with the scholarship.

These students will receive annually
a sum not exceeding $600 each and for
no longer a period of time than until
‘hey shall become twenty-five years of
a®e, according to the provisions in
Genera! Strong’s will.

FROSH HEATEDLY
DISCUSS FORCED

M. S. IN FORUM

Compulsory military training at
the University of Chicago was the
proposition which precipitated a
heated discussion at a meeting of
the Freshman Forum in Cobb hall
yesterday afternoon. The prepon-
derance of opinion among those
who spoke was opposed to such a
system.

Those who favored military train-
ing advocated it as a defense against
possible attack, an opinion which
was opposed by the argument that
such prepardness will encourage
war, and that the means to insure
against future conflicts is to avoid
armaments.

Those who spoke generally con-
ceded that there are other nations
in the world with greater arma-
ments than the United States, but
those opposed to military training
declared that this nation is in no
danger of attack, and should not in-
crease its prepardness by compul-
sory training.

The discussion wandered from di-
rectly local consideration of the
subject, and centered rather about
the proposition of military training
and prepardness in general.

PHI PSIS ARE

GREEK HOSTS

Interfraternity Council Holds
Second Dinner Under

New Plan

Dinner will be served at the Phi
Psi bouse to the presidents of all frat-
ernities tomorrow night, preceding the
meeting of the Interfraternity council.

Under the plan which-' has been
adopted by the council, each meeting
will be preceded by a dinner served to
the fraternity representatives. The
first meeting of this kind was held at
the Delta Kappa Epsilon house, and
Beta Theta Pi will be hosts at the
next gathering.

Install New Regime

With the reorganization of the
council last quarter, each representa-
tive, who had been chosen from the
chapter at large, was recalled, and the
council was composed of the presidents
of the chapters, with a Junior member
of the fraternity as alternate.

Stress Inter-Greek Cordiality

“The goal at which we aimed some
years ago has been attained,” said Le-
land Neff, secretary. “We then desired
to regulate rushing and pledging so
that there would be no difficulty, and
that has been done. Our new purpose
is to bring the fraternities together in
a social way, and that can be done by
having interfraternity dinners, smok-
ers, and parties.”

All Senior members of the council
are asked to be at the Phi Psi house
for 6:15 dinner. The Junior delegates
will attend the meeting at the regular
time.

CLASS OFFICERS TO
DISCUSS ACTIVITIES

With the object of determining the
year’s social program of the three up-
per classes, there will be a meeting
of the presidents and vice-preside.its
of the Senior, Junior and Sophomore
classes next Friday noon in the office
of Mrs. Merrill, director of social ac-
tivities.

The Junior class council will meet
today at 3:30 in Cobb 110 to determine
the policy of the class on this issue.
George Weimer, president of the Ju-
nior class declared that the meeting is
a very important one and urged that
all members of the council be present.

BOUCHER FILLS
WILKINS’ CHAIR

FOR THE WEEK

Is At Presbyterian Hospital;
Condition Is Not

Serious
-----♦

Dean Ernest H. Wilkins is con-
fined at the Presbyterian hospital
as a result of overwork and though
according to his physicians his con-
dition is not critical, it is thought
that he will not be able to resume
full duties as dean of the colleges.

“I hope to resume my teaching
duties next week,” Mr. Wilkins
said last night, “but it probably will
not be possible for me to resume
my full duties as d^an.”

During Mr. Wilkins’ illness. As-
sociate Dean Chauncey S. Boucher
is taking his place and will tempor-
arily at least relieve Dean Wilkins
of some of his duties after the lat-
ter’s return.

“Mr. Wilkins is suffering from
a local disorder. In addition he is
subject to a nervous condition which
is not at all serious,” was the state-
ment given out last night by Dr.
Herman Louis Kretschmer, his
physician. “We are looking to a
speedy convalescence and his return
to work in about a week.”

This is the third year that Mr.
Wilkins has served as Dean of the
Colleges of the Arts, Literature amr
Science. Tn 1912 he was made an
associate professor at the Univer-
sity and in 1916 he became profes-
sor of Italian. He is recognized as
one of the foremost Italian scholars
in the United States.

The “Better Yet” campaigns,
priority registration and the new
science course that is being offered
now to freshmen, are some of the
things which he has accomplished
while at the head of the undergrad-
uate schools.

President Max Mason said that
the University had no official an-
nouncement to make hut that Dean
Boucher will act in capacity of Dean
this week and will in all probability
relieve Mr. Wilkins of many of his
duties after his return to the cam-
pus.

HOLD TRYOUTS FOR
DRAMATIC PLAYFEST
IN REYNOLDS TODAY

Tryouts for the Dramatic associa-
tion’s annual Playfest will be held at
3:30 o’clock this afternoon, in the
Reynolds dub theater, according to
Archie Trebow. Production manager,
The Playfest, the proceeds of which
will he given to the University Settle-
ment fund, is to be presented in Man-
del hall February 5.

Students interested in scenery and
costuming are especially invited to
participate, as these two departments
are to be given even more attention
this year than in the past.

Leaders in the Dramatic association
promise that the annual benefit per-
formance will be a true festival of en-
tertainment. The program will include
three one-act plays, written by cam-
pus dramatists.

PLAN FELLOWSHIP
MEETING TOMORROW

Fellowship meetings conducted by
the Y. M. C. A. will have their start
tomorrow when the first of the series
for the quarter will be held in room
A of the Reynolds clubhouse.

Dr. Norris L. Tibbets of the Hyde
Park Baptist church will speak at this
time. All men of the University are
invited to this meeting.

DON THE TOCQUE



ITH a view to fostering class spirit, the undergraduate council
has decreed that the Various classes dem tocques representing

their respective years at the University. Immediately, we hear a
chorus of protests. The freshman objects to another emblem of ap-
.prenticeship. The senior considers such an insignia as an insult to
hsi years. As for the second and third year classes, when they think
about the matter at all, it is evident that they prefer to continue their
collegiate careers without any outward sign of their in-between

These very students, however, join vociferously in the general
cry that oUr University has no spirit. They seem to forget that
“school spirit* is the result of “class spirit,' and they refuse to give
their co-operation in order that the latter may exist. They are now .
being offered a unique opportunity to show the world that our school 1
has spirit. They are asked by the student council to wear headgear
that is interesting, in order that the campus may take on a bright
and interesting appearance. They refuse, naturally.

You upper-classmen who pride yourselves on being the leaders
of the University, take the initiative in this tocque-wearing campaign.
If you consider such an act beneath your mighty dignity, forget for
a few weeks that you are dignified, and get into the spirit of the |
thing. If everybody wears a class tocque than nobody will feel con-1
spicuous, except, perhaps, the few who do not wear them. The |
tocques will make their appearances within a few days. Let us ex-1
pect to see freshman, sophomoer, junior and senior wearing his class
insignia.

THE FROSH ARE WEAK

AS the fraternity initiation season comes around again it becomes
necessary to Consider the advantages or disadvantages of in-
itiation stunts for the Greek freshmen. There are certain antics that
are traditional in many fraternities and are perpetuated only for the
traditional value. If the stunts are in no way injurious to the health
of the participant they may well be retained. It is the twenty-mile
tramp through the snow and the merciless pounding of flesh that
must be denounced.

“The spirit may be willing but the flesh is weak. There are few
men who having made fraternity associations will not go through
mental and physical torture for the privilege of wearing the insignia.
Is hazing a prerequisite to membership in a Greek society? If so the
fraternity misses the great fundamental of association; the training of
leaders.

Over-severe stunts make the freshman lose time in his studies,
either through loss of sleep or absence from class. There is also the
possibility of impairment of health—as by colds and their complica-
tions. The fraternity can afford neither. Leniency will react to the
advantage of the fraternity and the University as well. Fraternities

be practically eliminated.

Tuesday Morning

Norgren Writes On
Baseball In Japan

Advertised for the January 14th
issue of The Big Ten Weekly is
a feature article by Nels Norgren.
Maroon Coach, entitled "Japan
Takes to Baseball.” This story
should be of special interest to all
Midway sport enthusiasts, as it will
be the first of its kind on the re-
cent Japan tour of the University
of Chicago baseball team.

The huge success of this trip has
been related many times by articles
in The Daily Maroon, but now for
the first time will he published a
signed story of the trip.

Your correspondent, a meek and
peace-loving man by nature, has re
cently hern shaken to the core by aw-
ful scenes of bloodshed and carnage.
He has shuddered to see blood flowing
freely from various and sundry noses
he has quaked in observing vicious buf-
fets dealt out right and left with ma-
il ions intent by one of God’s chil-
dren to another, and it lias pained hi;
soul and wounded his belief in the
essential nobility of man to see with
what rage-contorted visages one hu-
man being wil! face another. Further-
more he is maddened by the knowledge
that he must endure al! this for three
whole months.

Your corespondent is, of course,
referring to the interfraternity basket-
ball tournament, which is already, after
but one round of games, a seething
cauldron of hates and prejudices. The
other evening, having nothing better
to do, he hied his way over to Bartlett
Gym, there to observe, the Popopulo-
poponse (Greeks) in action. No soon-
er had he entered than he saw scenes
that made his blood run cold.

prom leader, break up a dribble bv
one of his opponents, only to have that
opponent wheel on him and deliberate-
ly go through with that action which,
in football, is technically known as
"logging.” This act consists of cast-
ing one’s body at the legs of an op-
ponent in such a manner as to cause
him to (another technical phrase)
"lose his pins ” This Mr. Kcrnwein
was obliged to do. and he went down
a martyr to the cause of dear old Sig-
ma Chi. with an expression of pained

back his fist in a gesture which could
not be misconstrued. nn1v to have the
captain of the opposing tram seize the
youth at whom this gesture was di-
rected and hustk him off out of harm’s
way just in the nick of time. And be
caw much more in the same line.
These things, as he said, cause unrest
in his heart. He believes something

DEFEAT BY HAWKEYES; DRILL FOR
WISCONSIN GAME NEXT SATURDAY

Iowa Five Overcomes Early Lead to Turn Back Locals In
Close Tilt; Phillips of Visitors Stars With
Three Baskets

With memories of th* Hawkeye de-
feat still staring them in the face, the
Maroons began an extensive drill to
polish up the offense which lacked
precision in the opening game. Nor
gren also stressed shooting, for the
Maroons were woefully weak against
Barry’s men especially in the furt half
when the Iowa defense seemed lax.
A little more practice and the Matrons
should be able to give the powerful
Badger eagers a close tussle.

Baskets and not shots at the basket
is what wins basketball games, ^he
validity of this statement was shown
by the Maroons last Saturday night,
when although having twice as many
shots at the hoop as the overrated
Hawkeye squad, they failed tn connect.
The result was an 18 to 13 win for
Sam Barry's proteges.

Maroons Start Well

Starting in whirlwind fashion the
Maroons obtained a 5 to 1 lead before
the game was five minutes old on a
beautiful one handed shot by Alyea.
Hoerger also contributed a nea* short
shot, whereupon he annexed his fourth
foul and watched the remainder of the
game from the sidelines. The Ma-

the corn fed tossers knotted the score
with some clever pivoting and accur-
ate long shots. Leading 13 to 10 with
four minute to play, Iowa resorted to
stalling tactics. Phillips, a substitute
who went in for Van Deuscn, was the
whole show for the visitors, sinking
three baskets and playing a most de-

MUSTARD

I know a girl who’s wonderful,
Possessed of winning smiles—
’And every day attired
In the latest Paris styles.

But she is eating hot dogs now—

Her smiles don’t ever take;

A hand that’s all bemustard smeared
Is mighty hard to shake!

GOOD TASTE is a part of every cur*
riculum.

It expresses itself at the foremost
colleges in the selection of Goodrich
Zippers for cold, snowy, slushy days*
Here boots are as fashionable as a
victory over a traditional rival.

Trim, neat—a wide contrast to the
cumbersome, wallowing gaiter. And
a method of fastening unequalled.

Don’t flunk in style—add Zippers
to your wardrobe.
