be

unusually elaborate. Flags and de-
partmental banners of various artillery
units will drape the balconies, giving
a martial atmosphere to the restivi-
tics. Six flood lights will be directed
from different corners of the room on
the ceiling to reflect a soft light over
the floor. Different colors will be
used for each dance. The committee
is also considering the idea of placing
a moon near the orchestra to shine out
on the dancers.

Programs for the affair have been
ordered. The covers are of piano ivory
with gold cords and crests of Crossed
Cannon.

Refreshments Similar

Hugh Wilson and Herbert Mayer
are trying to arrange to have refresh-
ments similar to those served at the
Inter-Fraternity ball last fall.

Just Supposing it
Was “Silent Cal”?

By Leo Stone

He is a small gray-haired, gray-
mustached man. He stands at the
entrance of Ida Noyes hall and di-
rects visitors to the check-rooms.
The dinner to Dean Wilkins had
just concluded and the guests were
congregating in the lobby. One of
them, dignified in dinner clothes,
stopped to light a cigarette. The
guard stepped over and whispered
authoritatively to him. He bowed,
apologized, and walked over to the
exJit to extinguish his cigarette.
The guard, appeased, went back to
his post.

One was a small gray-haired
man; the other was the Vice-Presi-
dent of the University.

A buoyant, girlish face of exquis-
ite beauty peered out from the cover
of the Phoenix when it made its long-
heralded appearance on campus yes-
terday morning. We are told that the
fingers of its author, McClelland Bar-
clay, were inspired by the presence
of a campus maiden when they
sketched off the picture. Her name
is Ruth Holmes.

The identity of the very fair
young lady, which has been the cause
of much conjecture on campus, was
not known until last night. But al-
though the announcement came late,
the connoisseurs of female pulchri-
tude had, hours before, connected the
sketch with the name.

Our fair model was selected from
a group of campus women by Mr.
Barclay. “She is the type I am look-
ing for;” he said, her face will make
a handsome cover for the Phoenix.”

“GARGOYLES” TO
DEFER ELECTION

Name All But Persident
Wait Until Autumn

After hearing “Young Woodley”
read, Gargoyles deferred the election
of a president until next autumn and
elected Ruth DeWitt vice-president,
Herbert Bassett recording secretary,
Ruth Atwell corresponding secretary,
and Eleanor Metzel and Hadley Kerr
board members at large.

All this took place yesterday aft-
ernoon. The persons elected have all
had considerable experience in dra-
matic work and at least a few
months’ experience in Gargoyles. The
elections were not very closely con-
tested, the meeting being almost In-
formal.

The presidential election has been
deferred until fall because there is
no necessity for filling the office now,
according to Ruth DeWitt, vice-pres-
ident-elect. This is the inactive sea-
son for the group, she says, there
being almost no work to do, although
selection of a play for production
next year is now going on.

The meeting was well attended, as
it is almost the last one of the year
and because of the election and the
reading of the play, the first one of
a series that will be read and con-
sidered for production next fall. Oth-
ers in the series will be read and
discussed at various times during the
rest of this quarter and the first of
the Autumn quarter.

Ruth DeWitt, newly elected vice-
president, will fulfill the duties of
the president until next fall’s elec-
tion.

Dramats To Read “Young Woodley”
Before Quadrangle Club Players!

The first of a series of reading re-
hearsals was presented before the
Gargoyles yesterday afternoon by a
group of students chosen from among
those active in campus dramatics
The play, “Young Woodley,” will
also be read before the Quadrangle
Club Players at the home of Vice-
President Woodward of the Univer-
sity next Sunday afternoon.

All the pity* presented in this

series will be modem, according to
Frank H. O’Hara, who is directing
them. The text of the plays will be
read, accompanied by a little acting.
From among the plays presented in
this way the players will select their
autumn play — the biggest event in
their calendar.

Those taking part in the reading
are: Jack Stambough, Fred Hand-
schy, Russell Whitney, Eleanor Met-
zel, Dan Rich, Ted Lockard, and
Hadley Kerr

CLOSE ELECTION

Harrington, Cuthbertson and
Tom Paul Also Get
Offices

James Cusacn, captain of the 1926
track team and a member of Phi
Kappa Psi and Iron Mask, was elected
president of the Interfraternity coun-
cil at the monthly meeting last night.
Tom Paul is the new vice president,
William Harrington the new secre-
tary and William Cuthbertson is
treasurer.

Only a few memebrs were unable to
attend last night’s rrteeting and fully
thirty fraternity presidents balloted
on the officers for next year. The
meeting was unusual for the opposi-
tion that was manifested toward nom-
inations, only seven men being al-
lowed to run for the four open posi-
tions.

Bennett and Stone Lose

Cusack defeated Harrington for
the presidency, Paul beat Wendell
Bennett, Harrington defeated Leo

Stone for the secretaryship,
Cuthberrtson was unopposed.

\From Student to
Hod-carrier; White
Has Daily Routine

Yrom student in the senior colleges
at the University to hod-carrier, from
working with his brains to hard man-
ual labor, is the daily routine of Joseph
White, former co-editor of the Circle,
and assistant editor of the Phoenix. t

White attends three classes at the I
University every morning, eats lunch, I
and then dons the clothes that are
marked and soiled with the grime nec-
essary to his work. Boarding a street-
car, he is whisked to the West Side
where he is employed by contractors
working on several apartment build-
ings. His evenings are devoted to the
study necessary for keeping up with
his senior college subjects. Yet he has
time to devote to his literary tastes,
as is seen by his,many contributions
to the Circle, when that was func-
tioning as an independent publication,
and by his work on the present con-
solidated Phoenix and Circle.

Seniors Vote to
Support Burton
Memorial Fund

By a vote of five to one, the Senior
class decided yesterday that the Bur-
ton Memorial Professorship would
receive their contribution to the Uni-
versity and the support of the classes
to come. The scheme was to be dis-
continued if the present Senior class
refused to back it. By supporting it,
the seniors have made it a permanent
feature of the University.

Although the date of the Senior
dinner has not as yet been an-
nounced, Tom Mulroy and Eleanor
Rice who are in charge of it, expect
to have everything arranged early
next week. This dinner is an annual
event. It will probably be held about
the end of this month.

Ray Johnson and Helen Liggett
are in charge of a unique and mys-
terious novelty which they will pre-
sent for the seniors’ approval early
in May. Nothing of its nature is now
known, except that it is of a thor-
oughly original type.

The voting, which was done in
chapel yesterday, indicated that the
vast majority of the class is in favor
of the present scheme, the balloting
being 206 to 39. This majority was
not expected by the Alumni council,
and the officers of the Senior class,
although they did expect the present
scheme to win.

“I am glad said Allen Miller, pres-
ident of the class, “that the Seniors
accepted the proposition. It points
to a high morale in the class. A gift
of this kind is of far greater value to
the Universit ythan a numeral bench
in a shady dell or an insurance
policy.”

W. A. A. SPONSORS

SIXTY COLLEGES

By George L. Koehn

Walter G. Williamson, Burt Mc-
Kinney, and John Meyer will have the
three big sub-manager jobs for the
Twenty-Second National Interscholas-
tic track meet, it was announced yes-
terday by Stewart Lytle, student man-
ager. Under the leadership of Lytle,
these men will put the 1926 meet “over
the top.”

Lytle was appointed last year arter
the meet was over as the senior man-
ager for this year, under a reorgani-
zation pign of the interscholastic de-
partment. Starting with this year,
there is to be one senior manager,
three junior managers, and eight soph-
omore committee heads, with fresh-
men sen'ing on the various commit-
tees.

University Offers Over 100
Fellowships This Year

More than 100 University fellow-

ships have been awarded
demic year, 1926-27, to
over sixty institutions in
States and a number of

for the aca-
students of
the United
foreign na-

tions, an official announcement of the
University states. The fellowships are
in thirty-one departments. More than
half of the successful candidates are
already holders of Masters’ degrees.

Among the institutions outside of
the United States which are to be rep-
resented by fellows at the University
arc the Universities of Manitoba and
Toronto, British Columbia; Queen’s
university and McMaster university,
Canada; the University of Prague, the
University of Wein, Austria, and Ox-
ford university, England.

YEARBOOK STARTS
FINAL SUBSCRIPTION
DRIVE ON APRIL 26

Next Monday the Cap and Gown
will start its final drive for subscrip-
tions. This will be the last chance for
students to get the book for $4.50.

The campaign will last for a week,
ending Monday, April 26, according to
John Hopkins, business manager of
the book. Students who wish to pur-
chase the book will be forced to pay
the whole sum at the time, as the busi-
ness department can not bother with
the payment plan at this time.

Payments may be made at Ida
Noyes, C & A, candy counter; Reyn-
olds club check room, and each frater-
nity will have a salesman.

Steer Clear of Flapper Kisses

Say “Wild West” College Profs

From the University of the “Show
Me State” comes the warning, “Be-
ware:. Kisses and powder puffs.”

To bear out their warning the
physiology department points to ex-
periments conducted by them. Two
slices of an ordinary Irish potato
and a dish of gelatin are responsible
for this terrible blow to co-ed stu-
dents who indulge in the favorite
pn«Hn>« of flapperd^in.

The experimenters got a man to
kiss a slice of potato. The potato
was then interned under an air-tight
glass dish. Several days later the stu-
dents examined it. And — four dif-
ferent kinds of moulds were found.
They were described as the kinds of
moulds found on jellies and old shoes,
and there were several colonies of
red, yellow, white, and purple bac-
teria. Six kinds of mould appeared
on a powder dusted potato.

The rushing department will be in
charge of McKinney, who served on
the campus rushing committee last
spring. He will take care of all cor-
respondence before the athletes ar-

they are on campus. .

Hard Jobs

Meyers heads the organization
partment. It is his job to direct
entire organization of the meet.

de-
the
As-

sisting him will be the press, arrange-
ments, and invitations committees.

The job that the managers are as-
signed to are no small ones. Starting
immediately, records of high school
men in all sections of the country have
to be watched, invitations and rush-
ing literature sent to the most promis-
ing, and press notices have to be sent
to the various news distributing agen-
cies. When the athletes arrive, two
thousand or more strong, they have to
be received, housed, and entertained.
After each event of the meet, the win-
ners must be congratulated, the losers
consoled. Finally, the best of the ath-
letes must be written to in order that
as many as possible select this Uni-
versity as their future Alma Mater.

The sophomore committee chairmen
will be appointed by the sub-managers
early next week.

BUSINESS DECLINE IN
SPRING PREDICTED BY
PROF. S. H. NERLOVE

Cites

Over-Production in Basic
dustries as Chief Cause

A decided recession in business

In-

ac-

tivity by the end of May, due largely
to over-production in basic industries,
was predicted yesterday by Prof. S. H.
Nerlove of the hniversity commerce
school in his analysis of present busi-
ness conditions.

Citing the two sharp declines in the
stock market as the outstanding de-
velopment during March, Prof. Ner-
love pointed out that prices of basic
commodities, such as wheat, corn, cot-
ton. and scrap iron have also shown
decided weakness.

“There seems to be very little doubt
that the peak of the building boom has
been passed,” the economist asserted
in weighing the probable effect of

major industries on the general situa-
tion.

“The automobile industry’ will prob-
ably contract from its present high
level of activity. The near future pros-
pects for the iron and steel industry
are not favorable.”

By the latter part of May, Prof.
Nerlove said, demand for steel which
is already on the decrease will prob-
ably be even smaller. Contraction of
activity in automobile construction,
declines in the building trades, and
weak buying on the part of railroads
will mean fewer unfilled orders for

iron and steel.

Declines in security prices have
been so drastic that the value of
stocks listed at present on the New
York exchange is approximately
$7,000,000,000 less than at the‘end of
January. Another unfavorable indica-
tion is the relatively low level of prices
for agricultural products.

THE CHARM SCHOOL

'THE New Student is impressed by the main feature of the Harv-
-* ard Student Report. Splitting up the University into smaller
more workable units is an idea at once appealing and plausible. But
we are not as much impressed by some of the reasons given for the
proposed change.

(From The New Student)

‘‘The plan is to promote better social life . . . “The purpose of
the college should be to educate cultured gentlemen . . . benefits of
■ the larger life of the college which promotes culture as distinct from
mere knowledge . . . reducing the “unassimifables’’ to below ten
per cent.” Such bits abound throughout the document.

Now what does this talk of cultured gentlemen, and the larger
life of social activities mean? It means exactly what one of the
phrases says, the pursuit of culture as distinct from “mere” knowl-
edge as his background is often uncouth, his edges are sharp, un-
rounded. He may be foremost in his field,—but, alas, impolite.
How different the graduate with culture, a well rounded person,
an individualist certainly, but flexible, knowing a little of everything
no one thing thoroughly. He is social, tactful, polished, hopelessly
mediocre, but a man of the world.

There is danger that he may become a type (that is, too narrow
to be properly tactful) so the report stresses the importance of a
small number of “unassimilable students—those who come for
mere knowledge, thus missing the benefits of the “larger life” of
studies plus undergraduate activities and socibilitis. But these leaven
for the well bred, while useful must not predominate, says the re-
port, and the university should be split up so that all men may meet
and mingle in beneficial social life. Culture must prevail.

We have on the whole no great quarrel with such an ideal. Some
of our best friends are cultured. A university with such an end is
probablya good thing. If no great genius results, at least no great
harm can come.

But somehow—we yawn.

To Weather, As They Play In Mud

Cusack, Hobscheid, Burg, Weddell, and McKinney Are
Maroon Hopes; Enter Seven Events;

Handicapped By Injuries

By Bob Stern

Thirteen men journey to Columbus
tonight to carry the Maroon colors
into the fray at the Third Annual Ohio
Relays tomorrow. After a series of
competitive meets and tryouts, Coach
Stagg has chosen the various relay
outfits and in addition has taken note
of several good individual performers

whom
special
relays.

The
rather

he thinks will do well in the
ex-ents in connection xvith the

number of Chicago entries is
large, but there is a definite

forts of the coach and the men. Gra-
ham Kernwein who xvas to have run
in the relays is not in shape to com-
pete; Johnny Metzenberg injured his
ankle during the early practice of the
week, and Les Beall pulled a tendon
in the back of his leg last night xvhile
trying out in the 220. So, xvith the
extra worry of inelegibles. the shaping
out of the team has progressed very
slowly.

Two relay teams are to be entered,—
one in the mile team race, and one in
the 880 yard relay. The men xvho
have been chosen to run in the mile

Although this year’s frosh base-
ball squad is not as strong as the
yearling turnouts in previous years,
Crislcr has two outstanding pros-
pects that should prove valuable to
next year’s varsity. Bob Kaplan,
of Englewood, one of the best
southpaws in the Chicago High
Schools last year, is showing fine
form in the daily workouts. He has
a sharp curve hall and plenty of
control.

The other find is also a left-
handed pitcher. Dan Cohn, star
hurler of Illinois Northern College
last year, and one of the most fin-
ished products that has reported
since Wallie Marks. He has a ter-
rific fast ball, and a tantalizing sloxv
ball, but is a trifle wild.

purpose underlying. The track men.
because of the inclement weather, have
had very little outdoor practice; in
• fact, they have been out on the track
for only two days. So the coaches feel
that the men have not yet had a
chance to show their best, and they
are sending all who seem to have the
ability in order to make sure that no
one who could possibly do xvell is left
out.

Team Is Handicapped

I-M MEETING WILL
BE OPEN TO ALL

In order to make the Intramural
Athletics as well organized as possible
a meeting to draw up a constitution
and standardized rules will be held

The irregularity of our supposedly
April weather during this last week
has forced the members of the tennis
team into the invention of a new and
novel game called “ mud-ball.”

The idea for this ingenious diver-
sion was conceived last Tuesday by
the writer, as he stood on the side-
lines watching the last dry tennis
ball arch gracefully over the net and
into the peaceful blackness of the
mud behind the courts.

“My goodness,” thought the writer,
“here they are waiting for the tennis
balls to dry off—losing a lot of good
time—while all this valuable mud is
going to waste!” With that air which
marks the true research »man, he
stooped down to examine the mud.
It was thick and gooey. “ Ha,” he
thought, “just the thing!” Arid
there, believe it or not, was the origin
of the new game that is being played
by the tennis team.

Unlike tennis, there are four-men
to a side. The first man is called the

' “maker”— he makes the mud-balls.
The second man is called tht “re-
finer”— he sees that no cheating Is
done by the first man, that no stonea
have been placed inside Vne mud.
The third and fourth men are called
“throwers”—it is they who are en-
trusted with the task of heaving the
slimy missiles at their opponents.

The scoring, too, is on a different
basis from tennis, the team inflicting
the greatest number of black marks
on their opponents being acclaimed
the winner. In order to reduce this
to an absolutely scientific basis, print-
ed sheets have been made which are
sent to all the laundries, accompanied
by letters asking the owners of the
establishments to make reports of
their findings on the printed slips and
to send them in to the tennis man-
ager so that the scores may be ac-
curately figured.

As an added inducement for all
those interested, they are thinking of
having jerseys made with the team
motto inscribed on the back, “ Thy
Name Is Mud.”

MAROON NINE OOES
SOUTH FOR ANNUAL
GAME WITH BUTLER

Practice Game Expected To
Be Close; Marks
To Pitch

• Undismayed by their chilly defeat
at the hands of the Purple, the Ma-
roons will trek to Indianapolis on Sat-
urday to wreak vengeance on Tony
Hinkle’s Butler nine. Butler has de-
feated Northwestern, so that if com-
paratix'e scores mean anything the Ma-
roons are due to be trimmed.

However, the lack of outdoor prac-
tice xvas evidenced in the sloppy field-
ing and poor pitching by the Norgren-
ites. Wee Joie Gubbins was wild, and
lack of co-ordination was shown by
most of the other members of the team
in their first start. The cold may
have had something to do xvith the
poor showing of the Maroons.

representatives Tuesday.

The following things

By-laws, In-

rulings for each sport, standardization
of prizes and awards, and the partici-
