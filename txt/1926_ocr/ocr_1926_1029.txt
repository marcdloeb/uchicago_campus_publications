HONOR MEN DANCE TONIGHT

One of the Illinois boys, who ap-
parently sees the lie in things down
in Champaign County, has come over
to the camp of the enemy and volun-
teered to offer the readers of The
Daily Maroon a series of weekly ar-
ticles exposing whatever there is to
expose in the Twin Boroughs’. The
first of this series would have ap-
peared in the literary section (so-
called) in today’s paper. It is far
from startling. Indeed, it is even a
bit flat. Maybe there ain’t nothing
to expose at Illinois. If this is the
case, Wilfred O. Cross is refuted—
and one of the best arguments used
by the boys of the Greatest State Un-
iversity to bring the high school lads
down to Illinois proves to be found-
ed on untruth. At any rate, the ex-
pose is here, but the Maroon has de-
cided not to print it. Bad as it is, it
at least brings out the signal truth
that even some of the Illinois boys
themselves are on to Illinois; other-
wise, there wouldn’t be any articles
coming out of Champaign.

* * * *

Last year for-two years I was one
of the hall boys, living in dear old
Hitchcock, shrine of the campus in-
telligentsia. While there, I suffered
most of the privations that can be-
fall man in this world. The soft coal
grime from the university power
house was daily wafted into my
room, where it spread itself over ev-
erything in a uniform thickness of
one-eighth inch. My soft shirts at-
tracted a large degree of this dirt.
There were other things, too, that
added to my afflictions. My hum-
able cot I use no quotes, for that
was what it was) was outfitted with
army blankets, which are, apparent-
ly, designed for “the average man”
of about five feet six. It was a task,
therefore, for one of my angularity
of frame to establish connections.
Either my neck or what I laughingly
call (another bromide: out of Lard-
ner) my dogs went cold, fre-
quently both. It was a horrible sit-
uation, and it wasn’t down at Yale.

* * * •

But nevertheless, such a glutton
am I for punishment, that I have
again this year taken lodgings in
Hitchcock. I am up on the fourth
floor, near God and his angels. The
dust doesn’t get up so high in large
quantities. Even the blankets are
long esough. Everything is, one
ought to think, fine. But still it isn’t;
there’s one thing that bothers me.

* * ♦ *

Last year, while in residence at
“th’ hall,” rumors came to me of a
secret organization functioning
throughout Hitchcock’s length and
breadth, its tentacles extending
through every dank passage and
holding the destiny of every resident.
There was, I heard, a house society
whose methods were not dissimilar
to a fraternity. When I first took
quarters in Hitchcock, it was my
hope that there I would be bothered
by none of the claptrap of the big
secret societies. But here was what
practically amounted to one in the
hall itself! Rumor came to me that
the members )of this organization
had the habit of looking new resi-
dents there over for two quarters be-
fore either bidding him to the Hitch-
cock Society, or “rolling” him,—
which last was equivalent to asking
him to leave the hall for Gates, or
some other place, whose standards
were not so exclusive.

♦ * * *

I moved out after my second quar
ter last year, so I never knew wheth-
er I passed the chapter. Now I am
back in the hall again, for the full
year. I am beginning to get worried.
The boys have not “talked frat” (or,
rather “dorm”) to me as yet. I won-
der if I’ll make the big secrets? If
I ain’t bid, I’m afraid I shall be a
broken man; the disgrace would be
awful. What would mudder think?

FROSH BOARD OF
MANAGEMENT TO
BE NAMED SOON

Undergrad Council Will Base
Appointment on

Activity

Within a few days the Board of
Management of the Freshman class
will be appointed by the Under-
graduate Student Council. Election
to this board, acting as an incentive
to all freshmen, is based entirely on
the interest and ability those appoint-
ed have shown in the various cam-
pus activities.

The Board was inaugurated last
year more or less as an experiment:
eight or ten freshmen who had shown
the most interest and activity in
Class affairs, were chosen to act as
managers of the class until officers
were elected, when the board auto-
matically dissolved. In this way, the
difficulties coincident with the ad-
justment to the first quarter, were
made less frequent if not totally ob-
literated.

Restrict Membership

According to Wendell Bennett,
president of the Undergraduate
Student Council, membership in the
board will be restricted to not more
than twelve members nor less than
six, the exact number to be determ-
ined by the apparent needs of the
class as a whole and the qualifications
of the applicants.

The tenure of office in this board
will, as before, last until class elec-
tions, about the middle of the win-
ter quarter. Duties will consist of
acting as guidance for the class and
performing practically the same
functions as the class officers do la-
ter on.

Urge Activity

Although those freshmen already
active in the various activities have
an obvious advantage, the board has
not been picked and it is far from
too late for the others to establish
a reputation for ability, the sole
qualification for membership.

To Join Reunion

Milton Sills, graduate of ’03, is
returning to the University cam-
pus for the Homecoming celebra-
tion on Nov. 6. He is bringing
Doris Kenyon, his bride of a few
weeks, with him. Present arrange-
ments call for a speech by the
famous movie start at the reunion
banquet on Friday evening, Nov.
5.

Sills was prominent on campus
while he was here as an undergrad-
uate in dramatic fields, showing
unusual activity along this line.

Found—a new employment for
the Undergraduate Council. It is
now learned that the members have
been equipped with honored gum-

to more effectively to pursue any
rumors which be at large.

This affords our councilmen an
excellent opportunity, since the coun-

refute favorite whisperings, such as
student migration to distant foot-

BURGLARS FAIL
AT BETA HOUSE

Gilliat Yields Thirteen Dollars
to Intruders

The Beta Theta Pi House was the
object of a holdup yesterday morn-
ing at about 2:30.

Two masked men armed with guns
entered the house through the front
door, and awakened Paul Engberg,
a pledge, who was sleeping in one
of the front rooms on the first floor.
Finding him without money, they
sent him upstairs to get some. Eng-
berg, instead of returning with the
money, awoke the members who
were sleeping upstairs, and immed-
iately the front bedroom was filled
with half-asleep, excited Betas.

The thieves decided to leave. As
they stepped out the back door, they
encountered Dr. J. P. Gilliat, a i
member of the fraternity, returning
to the house. Gilliat was then divest-
ed of thirteen dollars. A watch, that
he had, was not taken, as it de dec-
orated with the Beta crest. The ।
robbers hurried off. Half an hour ।
later the police arrived, but no trace
of the men were found.

APPOINT SENIOR
COUNCIL MONDAY;
JOHN MEYER ILL

Appointments to the Senior class
council will not be announced for
several df.ys because of the illness
of John Meyer, president. Due to
this delay the Senior class will be
unable to get their business under
way until next week.

Meyer has been confined to his
bed for quite a while. He recently
returned to his home from a hos-
pital where he was confined for the
first days of his illness. His improve-
ment has been rapid, and he hopes
to be at school this Monday. The
Sophomore class council will be an-
nounced also according to Bob Mc-
Kinley, president.

WOMEN NEEDED AS
BALLOON SELLERS

All women interested in selling bal-
loons for the Illinois game, Nov. 0,
should sign at the desk in the foyer
of Ida Noyes hall Monday and Tues-
day. W. A. A. is sponsoring the sales
and will award points to the women
who undertake the selling.

Every year W. A. A. takes charge
of the balloon sales of one game, the
proceeds of which are used for the
W. A. A. Outing club. According to
tradition the first touchdown will
mark the release of the balloons.

SHIELD OFFERED
AS STIMULATOR
TO FRATERNITIES

Sidney Collins in Charge of
Annual Chapter House

Preparations

Decoration of fraternity houses
to liven the return of the alumni for
Homecoming on Nov. 6, will soon
be started, according to William
Harrington, secretary of the Inter-
fraternity council. Many Greek
letter organizations have already
laid plans.

Sidney Collins is in charge of the
decorations. His committee is offer-
ing a shield to the best decorated
house.

The Interfraternity council has
made plans to sponsor a movement
to hold conventions at the various
fraternity houses. If this plan
goes through, the alumni of the cam-
pus fraternities will meet simultane-
ously at their respective houses.

Plan New Features

This convention plan for alumni is
among the many new ideas that are
being put in operation in connec-1
tion with Homecoming at the Uni- j
versity this year. It is hoped by I
those in charge that the fraternities!
will co-operate in assembling their
alumni this year for the meetings on
the day of the Illinois game.

Choose Four at

Debate Tryouts

Three debaters and one alternate
are to be chosen, following the final
tryouts, to represent the University
in the debates with the University of
Sidney, Australia, on Nov. 23, and
the University of California on Jan.
24. Today’s tryouts in Harper As-
sembly hall will eliminate about half
of the debaters who are now on the
squad.

Those who were successful in the
Tuesday and Wednesday contest are
scheduled for tomorrow: 3:30, Dum-
my, affirmative; 3:35, Cameron White,
negative; 3:45 Marjorie Carroll, af-
firmative; 3:55 Martha McLendon,

Phi Beta Delta will entertain the
pledges of the women’s clubs at a teA
on Tuesday, Nov. 2, from 3:30 to V.
in the north reception room of Ida
Noyes hall. The women will be en-
tertained by Emma Sleer, an alumnae
of the organization, at the piantf.
Phi Beta Delta is the second club thw
quarter to entertain the pledget?'* - [

YES! THEY’LL HAVE
NO EXAMINATIONS IN
DEAR OLD ENGLAND

Teachers organizations in England
have expressed their opinions in fav-
or of the abolishment of the examin-
ation as unfair in that it demands
the appearance of knowledge, and
not the reality. They lay stress upon
the wrong values, encouraging in-
quisitiveness and setting that qual-
ity higher than the search for truth.
Great applause was accorded to Mr.
Howell’s statement that the real aim
of education is character and the
general development of the human
being, and that examinations do lit-
tle to accomplish this broad aim.

PAST CAMPUS DAYS
RECALLED TO GRADS

Four college periods will be pre-
sented in the Homecoming night
program, Saturday, Nov. 6 for the
benefit of the old grads. The acts
will be characteristically costumed
and designed to recall campus days
to the guests. First is the 1893
group, followed by the Gibson girls
of 1903, 1913 a pantomine, and final-
ly a 1926 chorus.

Today’s rehearsals to be held in
Ida Noyes theater are as follows:
Gibson Girl at 3:30 and the 1926
chorus at 4:30. Saturday morning
at 10:00 the ballet will be rehearsed
Monday at 3:30 the 1893 group and
at 4:30 the Pantomine group.

President Mason
Makes Debut As
Instructor Here

President Max Mason will make
his debut as an instructor at the Uni-
versity when he gives the first of a
series of lectures on physics, Mon-
day morning. The lectures are a
part of “The Nature of the World
and of Man” course, and Dr. Harvey
B. Lemon will deliver the remain-
ing addresses on physics.

One_meeting each week of the gen-
eral survey class is conducted entire-
ly by the students without an in-
structor present. This is the first
time such a plan has been used in
an undergraduate class.

KENDALL NAMED
TO AID BOYNTON

Fills Settlement Night Finance
Position

Frances Kendall has been chosen
to act as co-chairman with Holmes
Boynton on the Settlement Night
finance committee, as Manry Harvey,
who was appointed last year, has
left school.

Miss Kendall has been prominent
in campus activities. She is chair-
man of the social committee of Y.
W. C. A., was in charge of the Quad-
rangle Fete last ytar, and is a mem-
ber of Wyvern. This new appoint-
ment has been approved by the Un-’
dergraduate Council. All other chair-,
men and their assistants will be as-
nounced on Tuesday. Team captains
and members will be picked and an-
nounced some time next week.

An all-University mixer, which will
be held Friday Nov. 5 at Ida Noyes
hall from 4 to 6, will officially open
the finance drive. The drive will end
on Dec. 4 with the annual vaude-
ville.

CURTAINRISES
ON UNIVERSITY
SOCIALJEASON
Soph Club Combine Draws
400 Couples to
Shoreland

Campus society takes its first fling
of the year tonight when four hun-
dred couples dance at the ballroom
of the Shoreland hotel in honor of
the club pledges. Score Club and
Skull and Crescent, sophomore
honor organizations, have combined
to sponsor this annual affair in the
best fashion ever.

“Our biggest drawing card is, of
course, the reputation of former
dances,” says Ray Murphy, president
of Skull and Crescent, “hut the
Shoreland hotel and Agne’s orchestra
will certainly be the other two big
features.”

Agne’s Band Plays

Those who have heard Charlie
Agne’s band have classed it as a
“knockout.” It has keen playing
at the Trianon for the past few
weeks and tonight will certainly let
off some of the steam gathered dur-
ing that time. Murphy has arranged
for some “special stuff” to make the
dances more novel.

The new Shoreland hotel has re-
served an entire floor for this dance
furnishing the guests of the evening
with every possible convenience. The
ballroom has been decorated by the
Clubs with large club pins around
which are arranged the colors of the
clubs. Each dance will be dedicated
to one of the clubs and will be start-
ed by the pledges of that club.

Plan Pep Meet

A pep meeting is planned to take
place during the course of the eve-
ning. The psychological advantage of
having the pep session during the
dance has not been missed. It is not
hard to show some spirit and make
a lot of noise when one is feeling
good.

The dance is expected to be of ut-
most pollity, marking as it does the
first time the sophomore societies have
got together on terms other than
rivalry, no matter how friendly”.

Green Cap Frosh
Must Make Report

On Mason’s Talk

Freshman who are candidates
for membership in the Green Cap
Club have had a new obstacle
placed in their way by those in
charge of the activities of that or-
ganization. They will be required
to state the substance of Presi-
dent Max Mason’s talk at the last
Green Cap luncheon.

While they will not be obliged
to summarize his speech, they
must be able to tell what points
he stressed in his talk on campus
life. This is a new feature to be
incorporated in the .general ex-
amination to be given candidates

Delta Sigs Hosts
to Greeks Tuesday

An informal gathering of frater-
nity delegates will be held at the
Delta Sigma Phi house, on Tuesday
evening at 7:30 for the purpose of
promoting cooperation between frat-
ernities and under-graduate organ-
izations. Each fraternity is urged to
send its president or some capable
man who can present any problems
of the organization which he repre-
sents.

The building itself, which is locat-
ed on Drexel Avenue and 59th Street,
has an interesting history. It was
erected before the World’s Fair, and
has been in the hands of the Uni-
versity for many years, although onlj
during the^ast nine years has it been
employed as a dormitory.

“When Drexel House was made in-
to a dormitory, it was originated as
an experiment, but its achievements
have established the co-operative type
of residence hall for college women
as a success,” continued Miss
Shultz. The sixteen women who re-
side in the house are divided into
small groups which conduct it in a
co-operative manner. Two members
of each group are assigned to cer-
tain tasks which they must perform
for a period of two weeks, at the
end of which time the work is
changed and new tasks assigned.

Although the co-operative system
of running this house is unique, it is
similar to the other dormitories in
its social functions and election to
house membership.

HONOR OR LAISSEZ-FAIRE?

A HEADLINE in The Daily Maroon yesterday read, “Honor Coun-
*• cil Seeks Support” and the deck contained the statement,
“Student Cooperation Goal of Commission.”

We are more than gratified that at last the body charged with
the difficult job of keeping the individual s honor intact during time
of duress, commonly called examination time, is functioning to the
best of its ability. What is more important, however, is the fact
that the members of the Council are analyzing the situation and
are making a different approach for the solution of the difficulty, to
our minds the only sane and lasting approach, namely that of seek-
ing the support of the students themselves.

Honor at the best is only an abstract thing, a term applied to
a state of mind in which certain acts are considered degrading to
one’s pride or dignity. Certainly, then, no possible set of rules and
regulations concerning honor can be constructed that will effectually
combat infractions. It is a matter of individual training. Rules
simply make cheating more intriguing to the student, and conse-
quently a greater number of students cheat "just for the fun of it”
and in the same frame of mind that they violate the Volstead Act.

What is needed, we believe, is a method of subtle disdain for
the act of cheating, upon the part of the Undergraduate leaders, and
thus the feeling will gradually spread to the mass of students. In
time to come the act will be looked upon as is today. If the leaders,
and everyone knows who they are, would simply refuse to associate
with people who were known to practice literary theivery, the people
would soon become branded socially, as surely as the scarlet women
of colonial days were branded physically, and the evil would natur-
ally lessen. Of course, everyone realizes that such an ideal state
could come only by a gradual and slow process but what time is
better‘to start such a practice than now, when the first mid-term of
the year are looming?

Think it over, you who are leaders.

“I IBERTY”, published under the slogan ‘Our country, right or
“ wrong,” and sold for five cents the copy at a tremendous profit,
has come forth with an editorial captioned “Learn Languages.”
With the customary obvious flourishes with which it so regularly
pleads obvious causes, this periodical decries and defies the multi-
tudes who scoff at the study of foreign languages, including Latin.

“Liberty” exhorts the American people to a more intensive
tensive study of languages.

And why? Because “anyone who attempts to do
through an interpreter is handicapped so heavily that his

and ex-

business
chances

of selling are seriously handicapped.” And so “Liberty” sees one
paramount value of the knowledge of languages: it is a commercial,
a practical asset.

‘The commercial value of language is hard to figure,” says
the editorial. “Considering the fact that America’s trade with non-
English speaking countries amounts to two and a quarter billion
dollars a year, it is evident that being able to speak the language of
those countries counts heavily.”

This is a commendable point of view and worthy of so vene-
rable a magazine as “Liberty". But does it get to the real root of
Latin study? After all, we in college like to think that the four
years of “Liberal education” througl which we must plunge or
founder before we can enter the specialized field, are four years of
cultural contacts, of artistic respiration. We like to think of the
knowledge of foreign languages as something more than a business
asset. We like to enjoy them not for what they can buy but for

MAROON DEFENSE STOPS OHIO PLAYS

STRONG TEAMS RUN AWAY WITH I-M TOUCHBALL CONTESTS

VARSITY UNE IS

IMPROVED;FROSH

TEAM REPELLED

Passes and Bucks Fail To
Gain; Drill New
Backfield

Coach Stagg devoted most of the
afternoon practice yesterday to send-
ing his freshmen through the varsity,
without much success on the part of
the frosh. The yearlings used Ohio
State plays, specializing in pass plays
and bucks, (for which next Saturday’s
opponents may have possibly earned
the name of Buckeyes) to no avail.

Just about one hundred per cent
improvement is what the regulars have
shown over any previous manifesta-
tion of defensive qualities this sea-
son. The Old Man’s prediction at
Wednesday's alumni banquet that a
better football team was going to
play this Saturday than the one that
lost to Purdue may be true, if the
crew keeps up to the level that they
have held this week.

Work on Signals

The varsity split up towards the
conclusion of practice for two squads
of signal work and dummy offense.
The driving from the coaches that
preceded the Boilermaker clash was
notably absent, and things looked
pretty well at a slower rate of speed
all around.

With McKinney and Anderson defi-
nitely out of Saturday's game, Cap-
tain Marks will probably be Stan
Rouse's mate, with Leyer’s holding
down the fullback berth. Greenebaum
is due to start at guard.

OHIO IS CONFIDENT

The following from The Ohio State
Lantern voices the feeling on te Buck-
eye campus:

Faint rumblings, soft whispers, and
quiet rumore are coming from all cor-
ners of the campus today.

• They go something like this:
Sh-h-h, Ohio State may win the West-
ern Conference football championship
this year for the first time since 1920.

For the coming week the loud cry
of the campus will be: “Heat Chi-
cago.”

PHELAN TERMED
“MIRACLE MAN”

Lafayette, Ind. 29—Just another
football game, won by one team and
lost by another was the manner in
which many fans looked upon the
recent 6 to 0 victory of Purdue over
Chicago, but to those in close touch
with Purdue football history, the
game entered the “football miracle"
class, and a glance at Purdue’s foot-
ball records shows that in winning,
Jimmie Phelan, head football coach,
had guided his eleven to a feat which
fifteen Purdue coaches had failed to
accomplish.

Back in 1894, D. M. Balliet.a Prince-
ton man, coached a Purdue team
which defeated Chicago 10 to 6. The
chances are that few who played in
the game or watched it realized they
w’ere witnessing the last victory of
Purdue over Chicago on the Midway
until a 32-year period had elapsed, ex-
cepting the 1918 game, which Purdue
won 7 to 3, a war year that is not
recorded on the conference books.

Balliet had three more chances to
crack the Maroons but failed, and even
Andy Smith, whose California elevens
on the Pacific coast spread his fame
far and near, three times tried to
humble Coach Stagg’s eleven, but
failed, only once his team was within
six points of a victory*.

Besides Balliet, other coaches since
1894 who tried to beat the Staggs but
failed were S. M. Church, A. P. Jami-
son, C. M. Best, O. F. Cutts, A. E.
Hernstein, M. E. Witham, L. C.
Turner, F. Speik, M. H. Horr, J. E.
Moll, Andy Smith, Cleo O’Donnell,
Arthur Scanlon, and William Dietz.

The memory of the late Walter
Camp, Father of American Football,
is to be honored at Stagg Field Satur-
day in connection with the Ohio State
game, it was announced yesterday by
the Athletic Department. A part of
the gate receipts will go toward the
Camp Memorial Fund, which is being
raised in this fashion at leading
games throughout the country.

Featuring the Walter Camp Day
will be the annual Kid football game,
which has been so popular with the
crowds in former years.

The Midway Midgets, who played
the Harvard School team in last
year’s affair, is to compete again this

year, meeting the Shore Sport Scouts
promptly at 1:45. The first half will
be played preceeding the Ohio game
and the second half will take place
between periods of the big game.

The Midgets, using Minnesota shif>
plays and building their attack
around Buddy Sherer, last year’s star,
will have real competition, as the
Scouts are reported as having per-
fected the Pennsylvania “hidden ball”
style of play.

The former team is composed of
University elementary school boys
averaging ten years of age, while the
latter averages nine years of age and
is an aggregation from the South
Shore neighborhood.

MAROON SPLASHES

Swimming is the favorite sport
of a great majority of the students
now taking graded gym but has held
no lure for them because it has al-
ways been classed as a minor sport.
According to Coach MacGillivray
there are no minor sports in the Uni-
versity and swimming maintains a
very high place in University athlet-
ics since it is one of the three self
supporting sports at Chicago.

Mac has some excellent material
for a swimming team and promises
some exciting times for those who at-
tend the swimming meets this win-
ter. /

Madison, Wis., Oct. 29, 1926—As
a preliminary to the Wisconsin-
Minnesota Football encounter here
Saturday and an added attraction
to the Dad’s Day program, the
Cross Country squads of the two
aged rivals will scamper over the
Badger hill and dale course in their
annual dual meet. The runners will
cover the Lake Mendota route for
a distance of four and nine tenths
miles.

The odds favor Coach Tom
Jones’ team to cop the 1926 affair,
after the brilliant showing made by
the Badger runners at the quad-
rangular event at Chicago last
Saturday.

FAVORITES OVERWHELM OPPONENTS
WITH BRILLIANT FORWARD PASS
AND OPEN FIELD RUNNING PLAYS

Psi Upsilon, Sigma Nu, Phi Kappa Psi, Kappa Nu, Sigma
Chi and Delta Upsilon Are Victors

In Yesterday’s Games

As the season advances the good
touchball teams seem to be getting
better and the weak teams weaker.
With this tendency it is not surprising
that the scores in yesterdays touch-
ball contest were as they were—over-
whelmingly piled up by the day’s vic-
tors.

Psi Upsilon put on the best scoring
exhibition of the play in their 42 to 0
defeat of Tau Kappa Epsilon. The
game was a walk-away for the Psi U
team with ‘Snub’ Pollard walking the
fastest. He managed to put over
three tallies, sharing honors with
Gordon, whose open field running was
one of the high lights of the game.

Sigma Nu scored the second highest
win, emerging from their game with
Alpha Sigma Phi on the large end of
the 30 to 0 score. A brilliant march
down the field brought m the first
touchdown on a neat catch by Curtin.
Hoey then caught passes tor eighteen-
points in a row, Ault scored the last
touchdown.

Phi Psi Wins

Phi Kappa Psi through a versatile
series of plays earned an 18 to 0 vic-
tory over Zeta Beta Tau. Budd’s
passing, Gist’s running and Farwell’s
snaring of passes were the best Phi
Psi ground gainers and three passes—
Gist to Farwell—Budd to Gist—and
Gist to Yager won the game. Met-
zenberg and Kramer did outstanding
work for Z. B. T.

Delta Upsilon won out over Alpha
Epsilon Pi 12 to 6 in the only close
game of the day. MacDonald scored
first on a combination of short pass
and end run. A triple toss—Steadman
to Klein to Weseran counted for A. E.
Pi points, and the D. U.’s ended the
fray with a counter on another in-
volved play—Clark to MasDonald to
Tohey.

Kappa Nu passed their way to an

18 to 0 triumph over the Lambda Phi
gridders. Early in the first half Stone
received a pass and went over the line,
while in the second half the Kappa Nu
offense opened up and Klaft and Stone
each snagged passes for trie temaining
twelve points.

Sigma Chi took the measure of
Beta Theta Pi in one of the fastest
games of the session by a count of 12
to 0. In the closing minutes of the
first half Young ran for a spectular
touchdown. The second half was
more of a battle, but McCarthy finally
took over a short pass for the other
touchdown.

HARRIERS ENGAGE
BOILERMAKERS IN
FINAL DUAL MEET

Although there is to be only one
more dual meet before the confer-
ence championships are held at Madi-
son, Coach Stagg is primping his
cross country men daily over the
Washington Park course.

Purdue is the Maroon’s lone op-
ponent in their dual competition
which is to be held at Lafayette on
November 13. From the known
strength of the competing teams
this should not prove to be a hard
nut for Chicago to crack.

“The Old Man” is, however, bend-
ing every effort toward a win in the
Conference meet which will be held
over the Wisconsin five mile course
on November 20. Even if the race
does not result in a Chicago history
the coach is confidant that he has
about six good men who should rate
individually and bring back some of
the handsome prizes that are being
offered. The strongest opposition
will be offered by Wisconsin, last
year’s victors.

Tells of Early Literary Career

Boni and Liveright to Offer Five

By Lucille Price-Benedict

Frank Swinnerton, author and
critic, who lectured at the University
last night on “Authors, Their Friends
and Their Critics,” doesn’t like inter-
viewers. So he told us when we in-
terviewed him.

Nor do we wonder much at his dls-

crimination after hearing how they
treated him on his first tour of the
country. It was the day after
Thanksgiving and the author was
feeling slightly indisposed, when a
“go-get-him” reporter phoned him for
an interview. “But I’m sick in bed,”
Mr. Swinnerton protested. “Oh that's
quite all right with me, I’ll be right
up.”

“Then there was that arch-notion,”
said the author, “that Rose Macauley
and I were engaged. I had written
a favorable review of her “Mtter-
ism” for one Chicago paper, and im-
mediately another decided that was
cause enough for betrothal. It wasn’t.
I had met her only twice.”

Then Mr. Swinnerton told us of
his life.

“However,” he remarked, “I myself
once wanted to be a journalist. At
the age of ten I published in our fam-
ily circle, a paper called “The Fam-
ily World.” It had a small and ex-
clusive circulation. When I was four-
teen I entered a publishing house—as
office boy.”

ON THE BOARDS

The current roster of plays on the
Rialto comprises, in moderation, ev-
ery type of dramatic entertainment
known to the present theatre. For the
drama, George Jessel appears in
“The Jazz Singer,” a piece about an
inspirant personage of jazz who on
the night of his debut is reminded
that tradition and duty must be re-
garded with greater import that re-
nown . . . The theme appears on
scant glimpsing to be of little sub-
stance for drama, but the author and
Mr. Jessel have made of it sound
stuff for the theatre and reason
enough for these quite' HI with two
much comedy-drama and revue to
journey Harris-ward. Mr. Jessel, as
a song and dance man, has found
hearty acclamation and now with
this dramatic effort wins for himself
that tit-bit of praise, “versatility.”
Of the other serious dramatic at-
tempts are the pieces as produced by
the Repertoire company at the Good-
man, which if nothing else, presents
excellest drama at popular prices
with stage settings of unique and
striking color, combinations and de-
sign, made so attractive by well ex-
ecuted lighting effects, “Kongo” is
yet another drama endeavor and ef-
fort spent in vain, unless there are
among us people, who found truth-
ful enjoyment and aesthetic appre-
ciation in “White Cargo.”

“ALIAS THE DEACON”

Preceeding Mrs. Insull’s season and
in consequence thereof made to
move prematurely, “Alias the Dea-
con” endures under that hardship
known to rudderless ships, dateless
collegians and rampant Fords. Had
it been properly press-agented and
housed permanently there remains
little doubt but that it would have
been acclaimed. Opening with the
setting of the interior of a refrig-
erator car, the play immediately
arouses that sense that whispers
“Here is something new.” And for
those who have made of the theatre
an institution commencing with the
first of last year, something new may
be found therein.

• The Deacon, Mr. Berton Churchill,
plays cards at times, although he
always assumes that position of the
beginner. He wins fabulous sums
from the two women who have been
living off the hotel proprietor at
bridge. Mr. Churchill has a most

Mr. Swinnerton subsequently rose
through the position of proof reader
to editor, which position he held until
last year. His career as an author
began when he was eighteen, with the
writing of “The Real Way.” This
novel was based on the quotation from
Browning’s “Sordella.” “The real

way seemed made up of all the ways.”
The book was not published.

On the eve of his twenty-fourth
birthday, Mr. Swinnerton’s first book
was published, “The Merry Heart,”
which .though it had only a small
sale, was well received by the critics.
“My critics said that it was a bright,
cheery, unpretentious book,” remarked
the author. “At this time I read the
‘Clayhanger’ and became very en-
thusiastic over it. It inspired me to
write ‘The Young Idea,’ a copy of
which I sent to the author. He so
encouraged me that I considered this
the turning point of my career, and
from this time on I turned my at-
tention to the writing of novels.

“Nevertheless I had published six
books before the appearance of “Noc-
turn,” my first successful work,” he
continued. “I consider this the alba-
tross around my neck because the
critics insist upon calling it my best
work. I hope that I have done some-
thing better since then. I wrote
‘Summer Storm’ to correct the im-
pression I could write only tragedy.”

suave manner, polished and sonor-
ous. He evokes chuckles thet pro-
voke hearty laughter and gestures
and ejaculates, smirks and grimaces
that build up with huge concrete
blocks a character to be loved and
adored. The Deacon is a card shark
wanted in every town in the coun-
try for embezzlement, but his benev-
olence wins his reprieve and the last
you see of him he is waving farewell
on his way to catch the west-found
freighter, leaving happiness and re-
joicing behind, leaving the villains in
irons, the victims of circumstance
in the arms of more victims of cir-
cumstance.

The cast chosen to assist Mr.
Churchill dies not come nearly to the
strata of Mr. Churchill’s splendid
performance and the audience is
made to bear up under such puerile,
amateurish acting. There has been
not enough ballyhoo about “Alias
The Deacon,” but you will enjoy it
immensely, even if your room-mate
has never heard of it.

“BUBBLING OVER”

Having had the good fortune to
evict “First Love” with not too much
alacrity, the Selwyn now offers en-
tertainment with music, where the
score may please if the libretto fails,
where the chorus girls may tanta-
lize if the team flops. Numerous
critics have arrived at but one con-
clusion in harmony, that the Selwyn
offers a musical comtedy adopted
from “Brewster’s Millions.” And
that the adaptation, as those things
go, calls to mind the original book.

Adaptations of late best sellers
have been meeting with prodigeous,
colossal success. Beginning with
“The Green Hat” and culminating
with “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes”
and “The Great Gatsby” we have re-
viewed the novel prototypes on the
stage and have found with rare ex-
ception few that failed to carry out,
if nothing else, the fundamental
principle as defined by the original
author. “Brewster’s Millions” has
become almost a classic with fiction
readers, it formed a basic block-—
much like ‘Treasure Island and Peck’s
Bad Boy’ for our early literary pro-
jecting. What the producer has made
of the play you may best judge for
yourselves with or without the prej-
udice that “Brewster’s Millions”
amuses in the manqgj of Saturday
Evening Post humorists.

Professor Justifies Slang Usage
Through Authority of Shakespeare

Bill Shakespeare’s sins have been
uncovered, but he will never suffer
for them. Instead, the present day
students think of him with grateful
hearts, for, following his precedent
of using the common language of
his time, we may fill our English
themes with so-called slang.

Professor G. R. Potter of the Eng-
lish Department of the University
of California illustrated his justifi-
cation of slang with works of Shakes-
peare and O’Henry, and explained
that language must continually
change to express current ideas.
Idiomatic phrases and colloquialisms
creep in but do not mean degenera-
tion, according to the professor. “It’s
me” and “ain’t I” are rapidly becom-
ing considered good usage.

“Grammar is not Scientific” Prof.
Potter concluded, “and it is natural
that it change according to the
times.” This is his opinion, however,
but of course we have yet to con-
vince the instructors in our Uni-
versity.

--------SPEAKING

The principle event of the week-
end is, of course, the Score Club-
Skull and Crescent pledge dance this
Friday sight. You’ve probably heard
so much about it already that you
know as much or more about it than
we do. But just in case there is some
person who has missed any reference
to this affair, we’re going to re-
peat the main details. It’s being held
in the new Shoreland Hotel and the
music will be an attraction by itself.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon is going to
do the evening up in a high and wide
fashion. They’re giving a dinner
Friday evening before the Score Club

we just can’t keep away from that

RELATIVITY IN THE LIBRARY

By Leonore Ovitt

That night I sat quite close to you,
Across a table’s length.

I saw you move, I heard you breathe,
I sensed your power, your strength.

That night we were—oh, miles away.'
I felt the distance, too.

Your thoughts were on our history,
And mine were all on you.

\ By George Leo Gruskin

Would you learn the secret?

Do you long to know

That with which I seem to mock
And tantalize you so?

I shall never tell you.

That would spoil the game.

Though you guess for ever
You will know the same.

Love is not a glowing glea/m,
Like moonbeams on a sea—

Love is in the shadows

That are swathed in mystery.

complicated and vague subject but
treated in a simple way by Dr.
Browne it becomes readily under-
standable. Copiously illustrated with
block drawings and animated maps
done by the author on travels in the
Orient, “This Believing eWorld” is
rendered more interesting than the
usual text-book. The book is writ-

dry treatise.

Regarding the Strauss Intermezzo,

Richard Strauss was in America, he
informed the reporters that the first
act of Intermezzo was completed, and
that the plot represented an episode
from his own life.” The incident re-
ferred to was the arrival of a letter
which Frau Strauss opened, believing
it to be important. The letter was
signed by a lady and caused Frau
Strauss to take her son, leave her
home and apply for divorce. A Tone

Saturday night there will be a Hal-

decorations; black and orange color
scheme, and all sorts of pumpkins
and corn-stalks. Doctor Watson’s or-
chestra, composed of five gentlemen
of color, will furnish the music. And
the Bros, are having entertainers

quite a party. No wise cracks intend-

A prize of five hundred dollar?
has been offered by Boni and Live-
right, New York publishers, for the
best essay on Theodore Dreiser’s “An
American Tragedy.” The topic for
essays is: “Was Clyde Griffths, the
central figure of “An American
Tragedy” guilty of Roberta Alden’s
death and therefore subject to the
penalty of capital punishment tor
first degree murder?”

Mr. Dreiser’s book has created a
furore among critics such as has
fallen to the lot of but few biograp-
hers. The streams of comment, ar-
gument and criticism have culminat-
ed in an article by Harry Salpeter,
critic for the New York World. In
his article, which appeared in Hey-
wood Broun’s column “It seems To
Me” on Sept. 8, he contends that if
Griffiths were tried today in Chi-
cago he would not be convicted.

OFF THE SHELF

“Singing Winds,” by Konrad Ber-
covici, which appears among the
newest novels on the shelf, is a col-
lection of short stories portraying
gypsy life. From cover to cover it is
both picturesque and light. In every
tale there is a bit of comedy blended
with the pathos of a wandering race.

“Perta” is perhaps the most in-
teresting story in the book. Perta’ is
vivacious, beautiful, and capricious.
When the clever Nicu declares his
love for her, she takes her time pre-
paring for their marriage. According
to the Gypsy custom, she may change
at any time, but Nicu is bound to
their engagement. Perta knows the
custom a bit too well for her Nciu’s
comfort. Always she keeps him in
suspense. One day she even cheers
his opponent, Robu, in a fight. Nicu
hears, loses his nerve—and the
fight. For days he can do nothing
but weep copiously. At length Por-
ta’s father takes pity on him and
gives him some needed advice on
women.

While Perta flirts with Robu, Nicu
appears. He is desperately mad that
his beloved should give her smiles to
another. Without a word, he thrashes
Robu within an inch of his life, drags
his darling to his camp by her hair,
and makes her wash his feet. S t?
recovers in time to kiss him and tell
him she loves him for his mastery.
They live happily ever after, accord-
ing to the custom of stories.

List Program of
Operatic Season

Chicago Civic Opera Company has
announced an opening week for the
1926-27 season of grand opera at the
Auditorium which will include six
Italian works, two French, and one
German. The season opens Monday,
Nov. 8, and closes Saturday, Jan. 29.

“Aida” has the honor of the pre-
miere, with two debuts—that of
Aroldo Lindi, who sings Radames, and
Florence Misgen as the high pries-
tess. Giorgio Polacco is conducting.

“JEWELS OF THE MADONNA”

“The Jewels of the Madonna” will
constitute the second night’s bill, in-
‘’oducing Rosa Raisa, Forest Lamont,
and Giacomo Rimini in the principal
roles; Roberto Moranzoni conducting.

“La Boheme” will make its return
to the repertoire with complete new
scenic sets for the second and third
acts, and dignified by a debut—that
of Luigi Montesanto, baritone, who
will sing Marcel. Edith Mason will
make her initial bow of the season as
Nimi, and Antoni Cortis will appear
for the first time as Rudolph. Maestro
Polacco will conduct and the occasion
will constitute his first reading of the
score in Chicago, although he intro-
duced the work to America at Buenos
Ayres as a novelty, a few months
after its world premiere in the hands
of Toscanini in the summer of 1896.

sympathy has been felt can be kill-
ed without utterly destroying the
reader’s peace of mind, Mr. Salpeter
believes. Since the opposite of this
opinion has been the popular theory,
Mr. Dreiser has raised the question
“Was This Muder?” And his pub-
lishing company have offered a prize
for the best essay on the solution
of the problem.

The contest is open to everyone,
All manuscripts must be in the hands
of Donald S. Friede, 61 West 48th
St., New York City, before Dec. 31,
The winner will be announced as
soon after the close of the contest
as possible. The judges who have
been chosen to decide on the essays
represent three distinct fields of activ-
ity. They are: Alfred G. Hays, law-
yer; Bishop William M. Brown, who
was recently recommunicated; and
Heywood Broun, New York column-
ist.

in the moonlight—that is the dream
that led Al Wells, in Cyril Hume’s
Golden Dancer, away from the stuf-
fy tedium of factory life.

Surprisingly, too, he found the
golden girl of his imaginings, and
quite as surprisingly he forgot her,
for a time. Then we watch Mr. Wells
in his career as an enterprising
business man, where he makes some
disturbing changes in the well-or-
dered life of the town. The char-
acters do not convince us particu-
larly, nor are we stirred with com-
passion for our Mr. Wells.

But that is all a part of the story,
we give, for all is beautifully tran-
quil and happy in the end. Mr.
Wells finds his golden girl once more
and keeps her this time, forever.

We discover we have read a so-
phisticated romance.

KIPLING ON THE WAR
“Rudyard, make some frank confes-
sions;

You got all the choice possessions;
Uncle Sam fulfilled a mission—

All he got was prohibition.”

This stanza which in itself is an
apt criticism and resume of the orig-
inal, appeared along with others as
a parody on Rudyard Kipling’s “The
Vineyard.” The original has caused
much editorial comment among the
leading newspapers and magazines
of this country, because therein Mr.
Kipling has insinuated that the Unit-
ed States did not do its share during
the World War. The poem is incor-
porated in “Detbis and Credits,” Mr.
Kinpling’s first novel for years.

Thursday evening brings the first
performance of last season’s outstand-
ing novelty, “Resurrection,” with
Mary Garden. Messrs. Ansseau and
Formichi will have the other most
important roles and Moranzoni will
conduct.

“TRISTAN AND ISOLDE”

On Friday Wagner’s “Tristan and
Isolde,” which has not been heard in
Chicago in a number of years, will be
offered, with Elsa Alsen, an estab-
lished authority in Wagnerian song,
with Polacco conducting.

“Rigoletto” will be sung on Satur-
day afternoon, introducing the debut
of the Norwegian nightingale, Eido
Norena. Charles Hackett will ap-
pear in his favorite role of the profli-
gate Duke and Montosantb ”ill sing
the title role.

IL TRAVATORE

“11 Travatore,” with Louise Loring,
Giovanni Polese, Aroldo Lindi, and
Mme. Augusta Lonska,will constitute
the bill for the first Saturday night
performance.

An all-star bill will inaugerate the
Sunday afternoon series of perform-
ances—Garden, Mason, Ansseau, and
Rimini in the first “Carmen” perform-
ance of the season; Polacco conduct-
ing.

“Lucia di Lammermoor” will be of-
fered as a finale to the opening week
on Sunday evening, with Toti Da!
Monte, Polese, Cortis, and Lazzari,
Frank St Leger conducting for the
first time this season.

Frank Swinnerton, Author-Critic

Tells of Early Literary Career

Boni and Liveright to Offer Five
Hundred Dollar Prize for Essay

By Lucille Price-Ber.edict

Frank Swinnerton, author and
critic, who lectured at the University
last night on “Authors, Their Friends
and Their Critics,” doesn’t like inter-
viewers. So he told us when we in-
terviewed him.

Nor do we wonder much at his dis-
crimination after hearing how they
treated him on his first tour of the
country. It w-as the day after
Thanksgiving and the author was
feeling slightly indisposed, when a
“go-get-him” reporter phoned him for
an interview. “But I’m sick in bed,”
Mr. Swinnerton protested. “Oh that’s
quite all right with me, I’ll be right
up.”

“Then there was that arch-notion,”
said the author, “that Rose Macauley
and I were engaged. I had written
a favorable review of her “fbtter-
ism” for one Chicago paper, and im-
mediately another decided that was
cause enough for betrothal. It wasn’t.
I had met her only twice.”

Then Mr. Swinnerton told us of
his life.

“However,” he remarked, “I myself
once wanted to be a journalist. At
the age of ten I published in our fam-
ily circle, a paper called “The Fam-
ily World.” It had a small and ex-
clusive circulation. When I was four-
teen I entered a publishing house—as
office boy.”

ON THE BOARDS

The current roster of plays on the
Rialto comprises, in moderation, ev-
ery type of dramatic entertainment
known to the present theatre. For the
drama, George Jessel appears in
“The Jazz Singer,” a piece about an
inspirant personage of jazz who on
the night of his debut is reminded
that tradition and duty must be re-
garded with greater import that re-
nown . . . The theme appears on
scant glimpsing to be of little sub-
stance for drama, but the author and
Mr. Jessel have made of it sound
stuff for the theatre and reason
enough for these quite* 1T1 with two
much comedy-drama and revue to
journey Harris-ward. Mr. Jessel, as
a song and dance man, has found
hearty acclamation and now with
this dramatic effort wins for himself
that tit-bit of praise, “versatility.”
Of the other serious dramatic at-
tempts are the pieces as produced by
the Repertoire company at the Good-
man, which if nothing else, presents
excellest drama at popular prices
with stage settings of unique and
striking color, combinations and de-
sign, made so attractive by well ex-
ecuted lighting effects, “Kongo” is
yet another drama endeavor and ef-
fort spent in vain, unless there are
among us people, who found truth-
ful enjoyment and aesthetic appre-
ciation in “White Cargo.”

“ALIAS THE DEACON”

Preceeding Mrs. Insull’s season and
in consequence thereof made to
move prematurely, “Alias the Dea-
con” endures under that hardship
known to rudderless ships, dateless
collegians and rampant Fords. Had
it been properly press-agented and
housed permanently there remains
little doubt but that it would have
been acclaimed. Opening with the
setting of the interior of a refrig-
erator car, the play immediately
arouses that sense that whispers
“Here is something new.” And for
those who have made of the theatre
an institution commencing with the
first of last year, something new may
be found therein.

• The Deacon, Mr. Berton Churchill,
Plays cards at times, although he
always assumes that position of the
beginner. He wins fabulous sums
from the two women who have been
living off the hotel proprietor at
bridge. Mr. Churchill has a most

Mr. Swinnerton subsequently rose
through the position of proof reader
to editor, which position he held until
last year. His career as an author
began when he was eighteen, with the
writing of “The Real Way.” This
novel was based on the quotation from
Browning’s “Sordella.” “The real
way seemed made up of all the ways.”
The book was not published.

On the eve of his twenty-fourth
birthday, Mr. Swinnerton’s first book
was published, “The Merry Heart,”
w’hich ,though it had only a small
sale, was well received by the critics.
“My critics said that it was a bright,
cheery, unpretentious book,” remarked
the author. “At this time I read the
‘Clayhanger’ and became very en-
thusiastic over it. It inspired me to
write ‘The Young Idea,’ a copy of
which I sent to the author. He so
encouraged me that I considered this
the turning point of my career, and
from this time on I turned my at-
tention to the writing of novels.

“Nevertheless I had published six
books before the appearance of “Noc-
turn,” my first successful work,” he
continued. “I consider this the alba-
tross around my neck because the
critics insist upon calling it my best
work. I hope that I have done some-
thing better since then. I wrote
‘Summer Storm’ to correct the im-
pression I could write only tragedy.”

suave manner, polished and sonor-
ous. He evokes chuckles thet pro-
voke hearty laughter and gestures
and ejaculates, smirks and grimaces
that build up with huge concrete
blocks a character to be loved and
adored. The Deacon is a card shark
wanted in every town in the coun-
try for embezzlement, but hie benev-
olence wins his reprieve and the last
you see of him he is waving farewell
on his way to catch the west-found
freighter, leaving happiness and re-
joicing behind, leaving the villains in
iions, the victims of circumstance
in the arms of more victims of cir-
cumstance.

The cast chosen to assist Mr.
Churchill dies not come nearly to the
strata of Mr. Churchill’s splendid
performance and the audience is
made to bear up under such puerile,
amateurish acting. There has been
not enough ballyhoo about “Alias
The Deacon,” but you will enjoy it
immensely, even if your room-mate
has never heard of it.

“BUBBLING OVER”

Having had the good fortune to
evict “First Love” with not too much
alacrity, the Selwyn now offers en-
tertainment with music, where the
score may please if the libretto fails,
where the chorus girls may tanta-
lize if the team flops. Numerous
critics have arrived at but one con-
clusion in harmony, that the Selwyn
offers a musical comtedy adopted
from “Brewster’s Millions.” And
that the adaptation, as those things
go, calls to mind the original book.

Adaptations of late best sellers
have been meeting with prodigeous,
colossal success. Beginning with
“The Green Hat” and culminating
with “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes”
and “The Great Gatsby” we have re-
viewed the novel prototypes on the
stage and have found with rare ex-
ception few that failed to carry out,
if nothing else, the fundamental
principle as defined by the original
author. “Brewster’s Millions” has
become almost a classic with fiction
readers, it formed a basic block—
much like ‘Treasure Island and Peck’s
Bad Boy’ for our early literary pro-
jecting. What the producer has made
of the play you may best judge for
yourselves with or without the prej-
udice that “Brewster’s Millions”
amuses in the manijjf of Saturday
Evening Post humorists.

Professor Justifies Slang Usage
\Through Authority of Shakespeare

Bill Shakespeare’s sins have been
uncovered, but he will never suffer
for them. Instead, the present day
students think of him with grateful
hearts, for, following his precedent
of using the common language of
his time, we may fill our English
themes with so-called slang.

Professor G. R. Potter of the Eng-
lish Department of the University
of California illustrated his justifi-
cation of slang with works of Shakes-
peare and O’Henry, and explained
that language must continually
change to express current ideas.
Idiomatic phrases and colloquialisms
creep in but do not mean degenera-
tion, according to the professor. “It’s
me” and “ain’t I” are rapidly becom-
ing considered good usage.

“Grammar is not Scientific” Prof.
Potter concluded, “and it is natural
that it change according to the
times.” This is his opinion, however,
but of course we have yet to con-
vince the instructors in our Uni-
versity.

Lewis Browne Opens New Epoch

In University Text Book Writing

, Something entirely new in the line
of text books is “This Believing
World,” by Lewis Browne. Dr.
Browne gives an outline of the cen-
tral plot, a sketch of the main line
of march followed by religion as it
advanced through prehistoric cen-
turies. He tells what savages be-
lieved and the meaning of their be-
liefs, covering the founding of all
the great living religions, relating
their history and describing theii
dominant characteristics.

Mack Evans Interprets Symphonies
At Lecture Preceeding Concert

Before the Symphony Concert Tues-
day at 4:15 in Mandel hall, Mr. Mack
Evans, musical director, will give a
lecture-recital on the program at
3:15, in the Mitchell Tower Music
room.

Glinka’s Overture to “Russian and
Lumilla” is first on the program.
Rachmaninow’s Symphony No. 2 in
E Minor, Opus 27, will follow. Mr.
Felix Borowsky in his program notes
writes, “This symphony was com-
posed at Dresden in 1906 and pro-
duced for the first aime at a concert
of the Imperial Russian Musical So-
ciety, at Moscow. Rachmaninow was
conductor upon this occasion, and also

SOCIALLY--------

------SPEAKING

The principle event of the week-
end is, of course, the Score Club-
Skull and Crescent pledge dance this
Friday sight. You’ve probably heard
so much about it already that you
know as much or more about it than
we do. But just in case there is some
person who has missed any reference
to this affair, we’re going to re-
peat the main details. It’s being held
in the new Shoreland Hotel and the
music will be an attraction by itself.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon is going to
do the evening up in a high and wide
fashion. They’re giving a dinner
Friday evening before the Score Club
Skull and Crescent dance. (You see
we just can’t keep away from that
subject.)

Just lots of teas after the game
Saturday! Phi Sigma Delta, Beta
Theta Pi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
are having teas; and Phi Pi Phi and
Phi Kappa Psi are having tea dances.
Whoops! Score for our side. Some
day we’re going to run for president
of something or other with a plat-

RELATIVITY IN THE LIBRARY

By Leonore Ovitt

That night I sat quite, close to you,
Across a table's length.

I saw you move, I heard you breathe,
I sensed your power, your strength.

And mine were all on you.

You will know the same.

treated in a simple way by Dr.

standable. Copiously illustrated with
block drawings and animated maps
done by the author on travels in the
Orient, “This Believing eWorld” is

usual text-book. The book is writ-

Regarding the Strauss Intermezzo,

Richard Strauss was in America, he
informed the reporters that the first
act of Intermezzo was completed, and
that the plot represented an episode
from his own life.” The incident re-
ferred to was the arrival of a letter
which Frau Strauss opened, believing
it to be important. The letter was

Saturday night there will be a Hal-

house. There will be the appropriate
decorations; black and orange color
scheme, and all sorts of pumpkins
and corn-stalks. Doctor Watson’s or-
chestra, composed of five gentlemen
of color, will furnish the music. And
the Bros, are having entertainers
out from the Aragon. Sounds like
quite a party. No wise cracks intend-

Phi Delta Theta is having a house
dance on Saturday night. Seems to
us they’re rather rushing things. This
is their second party so far this
quarter, but of course the first dance
was by and for the pledges.

A prize of five hundred dollar?
has been offered by Boni and Live-
right, New York publishers, for the
best essay on Theodore Dreiser’s “An
American Tragedy.” The topic for
essays is: “Was Clyde Griffths, the
central figure of “An American
Tragedy” guilty of Roberta Alden’s
death and therefore subject to the
penalty of capital punishmer-.t tor
first degree murder?”

Mr. Dreiser’s book has created a
furore among critics such as has
fallen to the lot of but few biograp-
hers. The streams of comment, ar-
gument and criticism have culminat-
ed in an article by Harry Salpeter,
critic for the New York World. In
his article, which appeared in Hey-
wood Broun’s column “It seems To
Me” on Sept. 8, he contends that if
Griffiths were tried today in Chi-
cago he would not be convicted.

OFF THE SHELF

“Singing Winds,” by Konrad Ber-
covici, which appears among the
newest novels on the shelf, is a col-
lection of short stories portraying
gypsy life. From cover to cover it is
both picturesque and light. In every
tale there is a bit of comedy blended
with the pathos of a wandering race.

“Perta” is perhaps the most in-
teresting story in the book. Perta' is
vivacious, beautiful, and capricious.
When the clever Nicu declares his
love for her, she takes her time pre-
paring for their marriage. According
to the Gypsy custom, she may change
at any time, but Nicu is bound to
their engagement. Perta knows the
custom a bit too well for her Nciu’s
comfort. Always she keeps him in
suspense. One day she even cheers
his opponent, Robu, in a fight. Nicu
hears, loses his nerve—and the
fight. For days he can do nothing
but weep copiously. At length Per-
ta’s father takes pity on him and
gives him some needed advice on
women.

While Perta flirts with Robu, Nicu
appears. He is desperately mad that
his beloved should give her smiles to
another. Without a word, he thrashes
Robu within an inch of his life, drags
his darling to his camp by her hair,
and makes her wash his feet. Si?
recovers in time to kiss him and tell
him she loves him for his mastery.
They live happily ever after, accord-
ing to the custom of stories.

List Program of
Operatic Season

Chicago Civic Opera Company has
announced an opening week for the
1926-27 season of grand opera at the
Auditorium which will include six
Italian works, two French, and one
German. The season opens Monday,
Nov. 8, and closes Saturday, Jan. 29.

“Aida” has the honor of the pre-
miere, with two debuts—that of
Aroldo Lindi, who sings Radames, and
Florence Misgen as the high pries-
tess. Giorgio Polacco is conducting.

“JEWELS OF THE MADONNA”

“The Jewels of the Madonna” will
constitute the second night’s bill, in-
troducing Rosa Raisa, Forest Lamont,
and Giacomo Rimini in the principal
roles; Roberto Moranzoni conducting.

“La Boheme” will make its return
to the repertoire with complete new
scenic sets for the second and third
acts, and dignified by a debut—that
of Luigi Montesanto, baritone, who
will sing Marcel. Edith Mason will
make her initial bow of the season as
Nimi, and Antoni Cortis will appear
for the first time as Rudolph. Maestro
Polacco will conduct and the occasion
will constitute his first reading of the
score in Chicago, although he intro-
duced the work to America at Buenos
Ayres as a novelty, a few months
after its world premiere in the hands
of Toscanini in the summer of 1896.

sympathy has been felt can be kill-
ed without utterly destroying the
reader’s peace of mind, Mr. Salpeter
believes. Since the opposite of this
opinion has been the popular theory,
Mr. Dreiser has raised the question
“Was This Muder?” And his pub-
lishing company have offered a prize
for the best essay on the solution
of the problem.

The contest is open to everyone,
All manuscripts must be in the hands
of Donald S. Friede, 61 West 48th
St., New York City, before Dec. 31,
The winner will be announced as
soon after the close of the contest
as possible. The judges who have
been chosen to decide on the essays
represent three distinct fields of activ-
ity. They are: Alfred G. Hays, law-
yer; Bishop William M. Brown, who
was recently recommunicated; and
Heywood Broun, New York column-
ist.

in the moonlight—that is the dream
that led Al Wells, in Cyril Hume’s
Golden Dancer, away from the stuf-
fy tedium of factory life.

Surprisingly, too, he found the
golden girl of his imaginings, and
quite as surprisingly he forgot her,
for a time. Then we watch Mr. Wells
in his career as an enterprising
business man, where he makes some
disturbing changes in the well-or-
dered life of the town. The char-
acters do not convince us particu-
larly, nor are we stirred with com-
passion for our Mr. Wells.

But that is all a part of the story,
we give, for all is beautifully tran-
quil and happy in the end. Mr.
Wells finds his golden girl once more
and keeps her this time, forever.

We discover we have read a so-
phisticated romance.

KIPLING ON THE WAR
“Rudyard, make some frank confes-
sions;

You got all the choice possessions;
Uncle Sam fulfilled a mission—

All he got was prohibition.”

This stanza which in itself is an
apt criticism and resume of the orig-
inal, appeared along with others as
a parody on Rudyard Kipling’s “The
Vineyard.” The original has caused
much editorial comment among the
leading newspapers and magazines
of this country, because therein Mr.
Kipling has insinuated that the Unit-
ed States did not do its share during
the World War. The poem is incor-
porated in “Detbis and Credits,” Mr.
Kinpling’s first novel for years.

। Thursday evening brings the first
performance of last season’s outstand-
ing novelty, “Resurrection,” with
Mary Garden. Messrs. Ansseau and
Formichi will have the other most
important roles and Moranzoni will
conduct.

“TRISTAN AND ISOLDE”

On Friday Wagner’s “Tristan and
Isolde,” which has not been heard in
Chicago in a number of years, will be
offered, with Elsa Alsen, an estab-
lished authority in Wagnerian song,
with Polacco conducting.

“Rigoletto” will be sung on Satur-
day afternoon, introducing the debut
of the Norwegian nightingale, Eido
Norena. Charles Hackett will ap-
pear in his favorite role of the profli-
gate Duke and Montosanto will sing
the title role.

IL TRAVATORE

“11 Travatore,” with Louise Loring,
Giovanni Polese, Aroldo Lindi, and
Mme. Augusta Lonska,will constitute
the bill for the first Saturday night
performance.

An all-star bill will inaugerate the
Sunday afternoon series of perform-
ances—Garden, Mason, Ansseau, and
Rimini in the first “Carmen” perform-
ance of the season; Polacco conduct-
ing.

“Lucia di Lammermoor” will be of-
fered as a finale to the opening week
on Sunday evening, with Toti Da!
Monte, Polese, Cortis, and Lazzari,
Frank St Leger conducting for the
first time this season.

CHAMPION GIVES

IMPRESSIONS OF
FRANCE, PROUST

Intimate glimpses into the lives of
Anatol France and Marcel Proust
will be given by Monsieur Edouard
Champion of Paris in a series of lec-
tures next week at the University.
The first talk will be Monday at 4 in
Classics 10 and will deal with Proust,
the contemporary French novelist
whose work has aroused interest and
discussion in France and abroad.
“Anatol France Intime” will be the
subject matter of the second lecture
Wednesday at 4:30 in Harper M-ll.

Monsieur Champion was a person-
al friend of both France and Proust
and has seen their work from a dif-
ferent asgle than the ordinary liter-
ary critic. Anatol France was for
many years a frequenter of the small
bookshop, full of rare and curious
volumes which was presided over by
M. Champion’s father. The shop re-
sembled very closely the bookstore
near by where Anatole France spent
the early years of his youth.

For a number of years, M. Cham-
pion has been the European repre-
and this is his first visit to the United
sentative for the University libraries,
States.

FRESHMEN DISCUSS
PLEDGING AT FORUM

“Should Freshman men and women
pledge themselves to fraternities and
clubs the first quarter?” is the ques-
tion to be discussed at the Freshman
Forum, Monday at 3:30 in Cobb 110.
Donald Rosenthal and Gene Weafer,
officers of the organization, are to
open the meeting with short talks In
the subject.

Plans will be completed for the
freshman debate with the University
of Iowa which is to be held March 10.
The Chicago-Iowa varsity contest will
take place the same day at Iowa,
while the freshman debate will be
here. Although the question has
not been decided it will undoubtedly
be the same for both conflicts. All
freshman men and women have been
invited to the meeting.
