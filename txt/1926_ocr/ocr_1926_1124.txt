GREEK MEETS GREEK TONIGHT

Settlement night is on the square.
It was not always thus. No later than
three or four years ago, in fact, all
the pressure of campus politics used
to be brought to bear upon the selec-
tion of those who were going to be
the guiding minds of the Settlement
drive. Jobs were bought and sold, and
many an ambitious young man look-
ed forward to spending the last two
quarters of his college career in lux-
ury and contentment. The poor or-
phans Back-of-the-Yards were too
often forgotten in the rush made by
the orphans in the third floor backs
of the frat houses to alleviate their
own suffering. And so things were
for a couple of years. Lately, how-
ever, there has been a change. The
Settlement drive has been clean. No-
body has got off with anything. One
look at the boys in charge reassures
one that no misappropriations are
conceivable. So one buys his tag
but, I think, a little unsympathetical-
ly. The old feeling one had in giving
cash over to the Settlement cam-
paign, when he knew that somebody
in all probability would pocket the
money before it ever got anywhere
nearer Forty-sixth Street and Gross
Avenue than a bedroom in one of the
nearby fraternity houses, is lacking.
We used to admire those fellows of
the old days who were so accomplish-
ed in their grafting that they could
even make money on Settlement
Night and get away with it. Nowa-
days, it seems, the spirit of the Lord
is upon us in all our undertakings.

* * * *

I note that the Northwestern boys
have been running somewhat amok
lately. Tying for the football cham-
pionship, the lads evidently thought
something was due to them, so with
out consulting anyone they took mat-
ters into their own hands. The tur-
moil started Sunday night. It reach-
ed its head Monday evening. The ac-
tivity of the celebrants was wide-
spread and (to them) eminently sat-
isfactory. It included: a) Putting
plaster-of-paris indhe classroom key-
holes, so that no classes could be
held; b) Forcing all not in sympathy
with the demonstration—law stu-
dents, grinds, etc.— to desert class
and join in; c) Snake-dancing with
abandon through town; d) Break-
ing the plate-glass windows in down-
town Evanston; e) Raiding the up-
standing Mr. de Bruil’s Food Shoppe,
knocking down the waitresses in the
drive, despoiling the cupboard and
distributing refreshments among the
crowd, so that it might be heartened
in its work; f) Crashing Messrs. Bal-1
aban and Katz’ sumptuous Norshore;
g) Trying to crash Messrs. Balaban
and Katz’ Oriental, and failing be-
fore the resistance of the B. and K.
imported giants stationed at the
door; h) Forcing Pres. Walter Dill
Scott to defend Old College, the ob-
jective of a big burning posse, with
pickaxe and fire hose against the
mob; and, i) Compelling Vice-Presi-
dent Dawes, guardian of the Consti-
tution, to deliver harangues from
the top of a fire truck.

*	*	♦	*

My only reaction to this all might
well be Prof. Freddy Starr’s cele-
brated “La-MEN-table!” I hear it is
the purpose of the Northwestern
boys to prolong their holiday through
until next Monday. I should counsel
moderation, if the boys persist in
thpir plans. I point out to them our
own laudable example when, in 1924,
our great team that won three games
and tied three more was judged first
under the wire. There were no 4-11
alarms, or calls for tear-bombs then.
And I thank whatever gods there be
when I review the activities of the
Northwestern boys that I am not of
that section or group represented by
what William Henry Hudson was
Probably talking about when he call-
ed it The Purple Land.

Standardized Space
Rate Championed

By Year Book Men

In answer to criticism by some
of the University students, the Cap
and Gown staff issued a statement
showing the advantages of the stand-
ardized space rate which was adopt-
ed with the approval of the board
of Undergraduate Publications and
the auditor of student accounts.

“It is a great task for the Cap
and Gown staff to bring this year’s
book to the level maintained by the
other Big Ten annuals. This is entire-

TAGS BRING $455
FOR SETTLEMENT

Award Prize to Winning
Team at Vodvil

Seventeen women’s teams collect-
ed $125 for the University Settle-
ment Drive yesterday as a result of
selling 3,000 tags. This amount falls
short of last year’s total by a sum of
fifty dollars.

The names of the members of the
winning team will not be announced
until Settlement Night Vaudeville
when the captain of the team will be
presented with a prize by John Mc-
donough, chairman of the tag sales.

POWER IN WINDS

MAY RUN NATION
WOOLARD CLAIMS

Astonishing calculations were re-
cently made by Edgar Woolard of
the U. S. weather bureau here, who
announced that there is enough en-
ergy created by the winds every sec-
ond to run all of the factories of the
United States for more than 400
years. Existant motors would be
antiquated if one using 1-100 of one
per cent of wind power could be de-
vised.

Hobscheid Still

* Eclipses Apollo

Mr. Fred Hobscheid, ’26, who
in addition to his other undergrad-
uate activities, will be remember-
ed by an admiring campus public
as the winner in the Daily Maroon
contest last spring “to determine
the handsomest man on cam-
pus,” has found a profitable rec-
ognition of his pulchritudinous
qualities.

Readers of Collier’s magazine,
November 20, were thrilled to rec-
ognize Hobscheid as the stern
faced gentleman who advocated
his preference for Ide Collar Ta-
vistock, and Ide shirts, Blencourt
23 and Surrett Street 5. Followers
of Fred will remember his ardent
advice to those with foot trouble,
by photographs of himself in foot-
ball regalia, to use Jung’s Arch
Braces.

TO WORLD PEACE

Levity Prevails as Chicago
Defeats Australia

In Mandel

The University of Chicago with
repeated references to the city’s gang
wars, was successful last night in
upholding the negative side of the
question, “Resolved that the results
of the great war have tended towards
world peace.” The opposing team,
which represented the University of
Sydney, Australia, was not so fortun-
ate in its field of references and as
a result was defeated decisively.

The debaters used a modified Ox-
ford system, which proved so disas-
trous on the last foreign invasion
when Oxford overwhelmed Chicago,
and were anything but serious in
their presentation of the subject. A
spirit of levity seemed to prevail over
the entire debate, with the full ap-
proval of Vice-president Woodward
who presided, and drew forth repeat-
ed laughter from the audience which
numbered well over six hundred.

GOODSPEED REVIEWS
RECENT PUBLICATION

“A New Approach to Later New
Testament Literature” is the subject
of the talk to be given by Professor
Edgar Johnson Goodspeed, chairman
of the Department of New Testa-
ment and Early Christian Literature
before the New Testament club to-
night at 7 in Swift hall.

No Issues of Maroon

. Tomorrow or Friday

Because of the Thanksgiving holi-
day there will be no issues of The
Daily Maroon either tomorrow or
Friday.

With the close of the football sea-
son, the Saturday issues will also be
discontinued for the rest of the year.
They will be started up again next
year, however, when football again
holds the interest of its fans. The
regular issues will be continued as
! usual.

Women Taxi to

Drake Hotel in

Private Groups

University women have been
urged to form their own groups in
going to the Army-Navy Ball at the
Drake Friday night. At a meeting
held last night at Ida Noyes hall,
Mrs. Edith Foster Flint, who is in
charge of the women, explained
that plans were being formed where-
by three groups consisting of college
society, and business women would
be formed during the evening. She
also gave the women practical advice
about checking their wraps, meeting
their escorts, and going to the per-
formance of local stars at the Bala-
ban and Katz Oriental and Chicago
theatres.

Because of the large number, wom-
en have been invited in three differ-
ent groups, the first arriving at 6:45,
the second at 7 and the third at 7:15.

BASIL MILLSPAUGH,
ALUMNUS, SINGS IN

COOP MUSICAL SHOW

Basil Spaulding Millspaugh, better
known as Basil Ruysdael in musical
circles, was at one time a University
student.

Mr. Ruysdael is an opewi singer
and at the present time is singing in
“The Coconuts,” here in Chicago.

He was a student in the University
in 1900 and was here only three
quarters. During that time he was in-
itiated into Sigma Chi.

Sigma Nus Sleep;

Frosh Play Tricks

‘Crabs, crabs, everywhere and
not one fit to eat,” aptly describes
the situation at the Sigma Nu
house last night.

The insubordinate pledges,
smarting under the humiliation of
their recently enforced forty-eight
hours silence, determined to even
the count with their fraters at the
first opportunity. So, with rem-
iniscences of their recent tri-
umphs still strongly impressed
upon their memories, teh malcon-
tents descended upon a nearby
Ffty-Fifth Street sea food em-
porium and purchased a half doz-
en malicious crabs. These mem-
bers of the genus Crustacea were
accordingly set in the beds of the
Sigs. When the hour of repose
ensued, the desired attack occur-
ed, and the pledges came out one
to the good.

INITIAL BALL OF
YEAR CALLS 700
TO SHORELAND

Bobby Meeker’s Band and
Wolverines Alternate

From Nine to One

One joyous maize of syncopation
and song will mark the opening of
the Interfraternity Ball at the Shore-
land Hotel tonight. Arrangements
for the ball have now been complet-
ed and the scene is set for this im-
portant social occasion of the fall
quarter. The Interfraternity Ball
which is the first formal of the sea-
son will be at once the most digni-
fied and the most typically collegiate
gathering of the year.

One merry mad jazz band, one
dreamy orchestra, fraternity songs
and a grand march will be only a
small part of the program of the
evening. The grand march which
will take the form of a large “C” is
to be followed by the singing of the
Alma Mater. Additional entertain-
ment and refreshments will not be
the least of the many features of the
evening—such is the program for the
Interfraternity Ball.

Leaders for the grand march have
been seected. There are to be four
couples, James Cusack and Elizabeth
Graham, William Harrington and
Caryl Francis, William Cuthberson
and Esmee Flack, Tom Paul and Syl-
via Sack. Among others of the fac-
ulty to be present will be president
Max Mason.

“All tickets have been sold and a
good crowd is assured,” says Bill
Harrington, general chairman of the
ball. According to the ticket sales
there will be about seven hundred
attending. Music will be furnished
by Boby Mooker’s Drake Hotel or-
chestra and the Wolverines, direct
ffom the Cadillac Hotel on tour from
Detroit. Decorations for the ball
have been designed so as to lend a
college atmosphere.

Tickets were distributed among
fraternities according to a new plan
worked out by President Cusack and
Secretary Harrington of the Inter-
fraternity Council. Each fraternity
under the plan, agreed to dispose of
$40 worth of tickets, or make up the
balance to the Council.

BALLOON SALES NET

$55 AT LAST GAME

Fifty-five dollars was earned for
the Settlement Drive by the sale of
balloons at the Wisconsin game last
Saturday.

Cora May Ellsworth’s team headed
the list with a total of twenty-one
dollars. The nine teams captained
by Margaret Newton, Helen Walter,
Miriam Gordon, Muriel Parker, Har-
riett Lemon, Edith Mariani, Clara
Davis, Alta Christensen, and Cora
May Ellsworth totalled $140. Sub-
tracting the price of the balloons, the
profit for the campaign is fifty-five
dollars.

Contribs For St.

Nick Phoenix Due

Contributions for the St. Nick
number of the Phoenix should be
in the hands of the staff by Monday,
November 29, according to John Al-
lison, editor.

Drawings, poems and jokes are de-
sired for this number. All campus
students are invited to contribute to
this number.

FOR A RESPECTABLE YEARBOOK

IT A MEETING of the Board of Student Publications last week
it was decided that the editors of the Cap and Gown should
raise the space rates for this year’s book from fifteen dollars a page
to twenty dollars a page. Yesterday’s edition of The Daily Maroon
announced the increase, and immediately there were low rumbles of
disapproval audible, and cynical smiles about the profits the editors
would rake in.

The truth is that the editors hope to make a really good book
of the 1927 Cap and Gown. The Annual of University of Chicago
has never been able to compare favorably with the annuals of
schools which are its inferiors in prestige. The reason is that the
initial cost of publishing such a work necessitates a large circulation
in order to offset expenses. Our University does not subcribe heav-
ily to the Cap and Gown. Last year’s Cap and Gown, which was
the best yet published, in our opinion, cost seven dollars a volume
to produce. It sold for five dollars, and the editors were left hold-
ing the sack, with nothing but two bad accounts receivable to show
for profit. The Cap and Gown can never truly represent the Uni-
versity until it has a large circulation or until it charges a higher
price per copy or per page of space.

As for the cynical smile about profits! it is entirely too cynical.
This year’s editors are strictly limited by the student Auditor, in
both expenses and profits. The decision to raise the price of space
was the result of an admirable ambition on the part of the editors
to make the 1927 Cap and Gown the best which has ever been
constructed. The five dollar increase will be used to secure better
engraving.	/

THE FRATERNITIES DANCE

TONIGHT at nine o’clock representative members from thirty-one
fraternities will repair to the Shoreland hotel fof one of the uni-
versity’s most brilliant social affairs: the Interfraternity Ball.

Twelve members from the faculty, including Mr. and Mrs. Max
Mason, will act as patrons and patronesses. Officers of the Inter-
fraternity council will lead the grand march. This will be the first
grand march in the history of the Ball, an institution introduced by
this year’s council. The Interfraternity ball is the only strictly Greek-
letter society funciton on the social calendar.

True to the form of the last two years prominent stars from a
downtown theatrical production will appear at the ball. The pres-
ence of people from the footlight seems to have become characteris-
tic of campus parties. There is a question in the minds of many
as to whether or not these “foreign touches” add or detract from
the general atmosphere of the party. It is possible that it is getting
to be “old stuff.*’

needed. Larger salaries are thus
possible, and the earnings range
from 200 to 550 dollars a week.

“Touching up of the emotions and
the subsequent appreciation of the
intellect,” says Mr. Whiteman, “is
the reason for the popularity of
modern American music.”

Greek Conference
Brings Fraternity
Men to New York

“More than 200 delegates from
nearly all the fraternities of the
United States and Canada are meet-
ing in New York, Friday and Satur-
day of this week under the auspices
of the Interfraternity Conference for
a discussion of educational and social
problems. The University is repre-
sented by James Cusack, president

Paul Whiteman, who is to appear
at the Drake supper dance of De-
cember 4 for this one and only eve-
ning in Chicago this season, used to
drive a taxi in the city of Denver
before taking up the study of mu-
sic.

Denver is his home town, and it
is there that his father is a profes-
sor of music, although he has taught
in nearly every big city in the world.
Paul played the viola under Hertz in
San Francisco for seven years, and

a little later with the old Los An-
geles symphony.

Whiteman’s is the only band of
syncopators that has ever invaded the j
sacred precincts of the “world’s
most perfect theatre”—Reinhardt’s
Groseschauspiel Haus Theatre, the
scene of the “Miracle,” and the last
plays of Eleanor Duse. According to
Reinhardt’s custom, all the numbers
were played without scenery, with
only myriads of lights for atmo-

NO SHORT CUTS TO
SUCCESS’—DR. PETTY

ASSERTS IN CHAPEL

“There are no short cuts to suc-
cess,” was the message brought to
the sophomores by Dr. Wallace Pet-
ty, of the First Baptist Church of
Pittsburg, at the chapel services yes-
terday in Mandel hall. The speaker
is a member of the Alpha Tau Omega
fraternity, and is staying at his frat-
ernity house during his visit in Chi-
cago.

Dr. Petty’s theme for the fresh-

men was based on the statement of
an old woman who said, “I haven’t
made up my mind yet, but when I do
I’m going to be better.” He urged
his audience not to assume such an
attitude.

Football is one of Dr. Petty’s main
interests. More than once he has
been called upon to pep up a team
before it went onto the field. His
church, which is located in the mid-
dle of the University of Pittsburg
campus, is attended by every mem-
ber of the university football team.

Board of Physical Culture
Meets To Vote On
“C” Awards

Saturday morning will tell the tale
of whether or not the rumor that
Stagg’s Maroons, remaining non-vic-
torious, would not receive their ma-
jor letters was well founded, for on
that important forenoon the all pow-
erful Board of Physical Culture
meets to vote on those players who
have been recommended by the “Old
Man” as deserving that peak of an
athletes desire, the major “C.”

All Eligible

All the pigskin warriors who have
weltered in the mud during a con-
ference game are eligible. No predic-
tions as to whom this honor will be
awarded can be made with any cer-
tainty, but some of the Maroons who
have seen the most action during the
course of the season are: Capt. Wal-
ly Marks, Ken and Stan Rouse, Saul
Weislow, Apitz, Leyers, Anderson,
McDonough, Spence, Lewis, Wolff
and Neff.

It has been rumored around the

One of the features of the foot-
ball season, just past, which has
been brought to light by post-sea-
son statistics, was the generalship
used by Capt. Baker, in the re-
cent Chicago-Northwestern game.
In the first quarter Baker, playing
quarterack, called for an assort-
ment of twenty-six different for-
mations which baffled the Maroons
enough, so that it was possible
for the Wildcats to score seven-
teen points in this period.

Baker’s feat was regarded as
one of the finest bits of general-
ship ever displayed in a Northwes-
tern game. The star Purple play-
er, who until this season has been
performing at halfback, has done
a splendid job at quarterback,
which was climaxed with his per-
fect generalship against Coach
Stagg’s eleven.

touchdowns in five Big Ten

In 1924 Harold Grange of Illi-
nois accounted for thirteen touch-
downs in eight games but his total
included those made against non-
conference elevens. During the sea-
son which closed Saturday, Herbert
Joesting, the great Minnesota full-
hack, made thirteen touchdowns in
eight games. But only five of the
Gopher’s touchdowns were registered

The official start of track practice,

won their letter are: Capt. McKin-

following Sophomores from last
year’s Freshmen team: Burke, S.

Williams, Frey, Novak and Garon.

Capt. McKinney is, perhaps, a bet-

To Embody Several
New Feature Races

With the coming of winter, and
the near closing of the touchball and
horseshoe seasons for the I-M de-
partment, those interested in minor
sports are turning toward the Annual
Swimming Carnival. The finals for
this event will be held on Friday, De-
cember 3, from 7:15 to 9:30. Many
novelty races and contests have been
planned and any man, varsity or
otherwise, is permitted to enter.

The officials will be the coaches
from Hyde Park, Englewood, Tilden,
Senn, and Lindblom high school.
These coaches are each to bring a
six man relay team with them.
There will be a life saving exhibition
by the Red Cross Life Savers from
the Illinois Athletic Club.

it first down on his 35 yard line.
Raysson slid through center for
three yards, the yearlings were off-
side on the next play, and Pratt
plunged through center for the short
remaining distance to a first down
on his 45 yard line. From here
Toigo was stopped with a two yard
gain off right tackle, but on the next
play a side-line pass from Raysson
to Freeman was good for 40 yards.
Toigo hit center for four and right
tackle for one yard on the next two
plays. Then, with five yards re-
maining Raysson went over for the
first score on a beautiful off-tackle
drive and a cut-back to the center.
Pratt place-kicked and the score was:
Varsity 7, Frosh 0.

more. Two touchdowns and a lot
of fight, some end runs and some
fierce tackles, a few fumbles and
some forward passes helped bring
this hectic grid season to a success-
ful close yesterday afternoon. Any-
way, Coach Stagg smiled on as he
watched his faithful reserves play
brilliantly in the first half of their
post-season game with the Frosh
eleven to score those two touch-
downs. And he continued to smile
when his next year’s sophomores
came back strong in the second half
to carry the battle to the veterans
and make these two touchdowns the
only ones of the game.

Score Early

It didn’t take long for the veterans
to get going. Their early march to
the goal line is best told by this
play-by-play version: The Frosh won
the toss and chose to kick off, boot-
ing the ball to Togo Dygert, varsity
quarterback, who returned to his 25-
yard line. A surprise pass on the
first play was grounded by a wide-
awake Frosh, but on the second play,
Pratt, speedy varsity half-back, dash-
ed off tackle for 10 yards and made

RIFLE CLUB PLANS
FOR YEAR INCLUDE

Campus women are again receiv-
inig training in shooting. There is
no particular need for alarm, how-
ever, as the men are also receiving
like training under the organization
of the Rifle Club. The men meet
twice a week, Tuesday and Thurs-
day evenings from 7 to 9 with range
master, R. D. Bensley. Rifle range
is in the stadium, north door of mid-
dle entrance, on Ellis Avenue.

Women meet for rifle drill at the
same place on Wednesday night. Ri-
fles and instruction are free and am-
munition may be obtained at whole-
sale price. Club dues for the period
from November to April are one dol-
lar.

Through a mistake it was announc-
ed on the sport page of yesterday’s
Daily Maroon that Lawrence Apitz,
star end on the football team had
played his last game for Chicago Sat-
urday. Apitz has four more quar-
ters in school and is eligible for an-
other year of football. The mistake
arose from the fact that he is a uni-
versity marshall, an honor usually
awarded to seniors only. The same
error was also made by several down
town papers.

I-M INKUNGS

In connection with the I-M Swim-
ming Carnival the I-M Division an-
nounces one of the most interesting
races ever held at this university.
Five of the best known high schools
in the city, Hyde Park, Englewood,
Lindblom, Senn and Tilden, are
sending the cream of their swimming
squads for a six-man team race.

Maroon swimmers will lead a wa-
ter polo attack on the Illinois Ath-
letic Club Thursday, December 2.
The game will be one of the fea-
tures of the Cook County Interscho-
lastic meet which will be held De-
cember 1st and 2nd.

The Illinois Athletic Club have
been Cook County champions in wa-
ter polo for so long that Coach Mac-
Gillivray, with a green team, does
not hope to beat them. “This is mere-

HOW DO I KNOW ....

How do 1 Enow that love must die?

Because I have seen a jade-winged
moth

Hovering in expectancy

Above a FUme, quiver pitifully. . .

And flutter downward. . . .lifelessly.

Because I have seen a scarlet poppy
gleam

An instant in a sunny field ...

Have seen the wind that chills

Steal over it, and watched

Its radiant promise fade

As fades a crushed and broken

dream.

Because I have seen a glowing star

That seemed so safe. . . so far

From human cry,

In one swift second, pause

And hurtle ... dimly ... through the
sky.

Ah, that is how 1 know

That love must die.

WELL, the college boys at North-
western seem to be whooping it up.
Why, we bet it won’t be long before
they’ll be taking men away from Il-
linois.

The reason, as we understand it,
for the Wildcats becoming so kit-
tenish is because of the victory over
Chicago, and President Scott’s assur-
ance to the multitude that despite
Michigan’s record he “knows a cham-
pionship team when he sees one.”
What with their descent on the loop
yesterday, their pillage of Evanston,
and the raid on the elevated trains,
perhaps we at Chicago are fortunate
that our school is on the South Side.
They might even have gone into the
Daily Maroon office and taken papers
without paying for them!

And Maybe Some of the Stokers
Will Be Fired!

Dear Turk:

If Northwestern burns up the old
College building in celebration of the
Big Ten title I hope some of the
sparks fall on their new Dyche stad-
ium.

AUTUMN RAIN
A Little Boy’s Idea
Rain falls like an icy bath
Which spurts from my shower in the
tub
Trees shiver wet and naked—
It’s cold, and they’d like a rub.

God is trying to wash the earth,
Clean from a summer’s dust;

Trying to polish Nature—
Scrub off the autumn rust.

By and by, when He sees He can’t, .
He’ll cover it under white snow,
And hide away all the dirt

So that no one will ever know.

And then, tired of pretending,
He’ll start with things all new;

And we’ll call the season Spring-
time—
That’s what God’s gonna do!

—Atlas

Say, “Dirty”

And there are three things I hate
myself—Campus women, women on
campus, and University girls!

—The Campus Sewer

GEOG referring to the new eligi-
bility system for the Women’s Clubs
which requires the maintenance of a
C average before initiation, stops to
ask if this has anything to do with
the number of football, basketball
and baseball players devoted to their
interests?

Seniors won’t be on Campus to
wave their canes this Thursday.
We’ll have to content ourselves with
drum-sticks.

at the halfback jobs may elicit some
criticism. Eby of Ohio State though
a fine runner does not come up to
the all-around form of these two
men. They are rugged players, good
at blocking and tackling as well as
running. Both were marked men,
but they played a consistently good
game throughout the season.

The writer cannot see how anyone
can leave Joesting, Friedman, Ooost-
erbaan, and Hess off their all-confer-
ence elevens. Shively of Illinois has
the edge over Hanson who starred on
the powerful Gopher line. K. Rouse

THIS fellow missed out on a heavy date tonight
by the close margin of one phone-call. But
don’t waste pity on him. He has his jimmy-
pipe and a tidy red tin of Prince Albert . . .
grand little pals in time of stress.

When that cool, comforting smoke comes
curling up the pipe-stem, troubles evanesce with
every puff. For P. A. is The National Joy
Smoke in fact as well as phrase. Cool as a
money-lender. Sweet as a check from home.
Fragrant as a pine-grove on a damp morning.

You’ll like Prince Albert better than any
other tobacco you ever packed into a pipe.
You’ll like the friendly way it treats your tongue
and throat. You’ll like the way it helps you over
the rough spots. Buy a tidy red tin today and see!
