WHAT OF
IT?

fy&M^Mq^tern

Sometimes it is an awful thing to
get kicked out of college; sometimes it
is not, as when the kicked individual
leaves town in a burst of glory and a
rented halo. Such an exodus as this
last was made. I recall, some five years
ago by the editor of the Syracuse
•‘Orange Peel"—a journal occupying
in its college a position parallel to
♦hat of “The Phoenix” here. The edi-
tor of “The Orange Peel," in one of
his monthly doses to the student-body
dropped a peel upon which he slip-
ped, and came down hard. The fac-
u|n mind was that the item in ques-
tion reflected what was termed offici-
ally “a low tone", so the editor pack-
ed up and left for new fields. He de-
parted in a shower of tossed roses,
song, and praise. Attempts were made
as when in the middle age a famous
holy men would walk down the thor-
oughfare. to kiss the hem of his top-
coat on the path down to the station.
He had lied for THE CAUSE—that
cause, that “is, which the students
thought was a cause: the defying of
the faculty' for the benefit of the studes. f
What if the rah-rah turned out to be
raw-raw? The editor of “The Orange
Peel” had done a great work.

♦ ♦ ♦ ♦

This is rather a nice way to get
kicked out of school. If ever 1 make
up my mind to get booted out onto
the sidewalk, I shall most certainly
adopt the procedure followed by the
editor of “Th Orange Peel." There
are lots of other ways of getting kick-
ed ut. too, but none of them quite
as good. True I heard of a very nice
way the other day, but it called for
rather extraordinary circumstances.
The kickees, in this especial instance,
were eight students aboard the S. S.
Ryndam, “floating college" now some-
where or other in the Pacific Ocean.
It is, you will have to grant, one thing
to get kicked out onto the cement
street, and another to get booted over
the taffrail into the ocean. Not ^11 of
us can manage such a luxurious, an
individual way. We must adopt a
simpler manner.

♦ * * ♦

Life on the “floating college” must,
at that, be something to sing about.
I here are co-eds aboard the boat;
there is. if one can believe a picture
which I recently saw, liquor aboard
also. It was, probably, a “framed" pic-
ture, yet it reflected a condition which
one might well consider to be actual
aboard the Ryndham. The photograph
in question showed six of the boys
lined up along the rail, their shoulders
''tispiciously hunched, hip-flasks pro-
truding from their rear pockets, and
a group of other loungers sprawled
just as supiciously over the surround-
ing <leck. I am sure that the picture
"as, as I have said, “framed.” For
does not “The Binnacle,” official stu-
dent paper .put out on the boat, de-
scribe the activities of the boys afloat
as contricted to “........ a routine of

classroom exercises and legitimate stu-
dent activities?” When one recalls the
eight collegians who went down the
plank at Kobe, Japan, however, one is
inclined to believe that there may be
more than “the student orchestra,
Planet Players, faculty teas and
dances” described by “The Binnacle”
"i the line of diversion on the good
ship Ryndham.

♦ ♦ * ♦

Well, it was, as I say, a romantic
"ay of getting kicked out of college.
L would be an experience to remem-.
her. I he boys tossed out made it i
even better, for two of the party be- ,
ing conducted back to the States un-.
der the care of a professor, in order
to keep them out of mischief,, dived
overboard from the boat in which they
"ere leaving Honolulu, and returned
to the city. Which goes to show that
Arabian Nights stuff is possible in col-
lege that is, a “floating college.”

BIG MAROON ISSUE
READY FOR PRESS;

ON CAMPUS FRIDAY

Print 2,000 Copies of the
Largest Edition of

Campus Paper

With the forms almost ready to roll
off 2,000 copies of the largest edition
ever published by The Daily Maroon,
staff members worked late last night
and all day today, and will work
again tonight, putting the finishing
touches to the big Christmas issue ap-
pearing Friday.

Featuring the biggest stories of the
year in the paper, Walter G. William-
son, Maroon editor, declared that he
will release as a Christmas present to
the campus, news that will keep the
student body agog until the return to
school after the holidays.

Announce Dance Leaders

The Washington Prom leaders, the
Military Ball leaders, the orchestras
and sites for the two big dances, the
title and authors of the 1927 Mirror
production, the winning manuscripts
and authors in the 1927 Blackfriars’
competition, the head of the twenty-
third Stagg track interscholastic, will
all be announced through exclusive
stories in the Christmas edition of
The Daily Maroon.

Twenty pages will be devoted to a
magazine section containing messages
from men of national and local fame
to university students. Eight pages
of rotogravure with messages from
faculty members to students will be
included. Pictures of campus leaders
and the newly announced dance lead-
ers have been placed in the rotograv-
ure section. Extra copies of the edi-
tion will he sold for te| cents.

ANTHROPOLOGY GRAD
TALKS TO STUDENTS
ON PREHISTORIC ART

Miss Charlotte Gower, graduate
student in the department of Anthro-
pology, will lecture on “Prehistoric
Art” at a meeting of the art club to
be held today at 4 in Classics 10.

Miss Gower has been interested in
special research work in the field of
prehistoric art. Last summer she was
the leader of an expedition for study
and excavation in southern France.
The art club considers itself fortunate
in having Miss Gower address them,
according to Isabelle Williams, presi-
dent of the organization. All Univer-
sity students have been invited to at-
tend the meeting.

CAMPUS LIFE LESS
EXPENSIVE IN 1890

How far would a dollar and fifteen
cents a week go toward procuring
a college education and good living
conditions today?

“In the good old days ' of 1890 one
could have all he wished along these
two lines for just that price, according
to an advertisement in the Fayette In-
telligencer of Columbia, Missouri,
April 25, 1892.

Description of the schoolhuse giv-
en declared that the student would
have all the accommodations offered
by a “commodious brick building sit-
uated in a healthy, highly moral and
very respectable neighborhood.”

Cap and Gown Staff

After Activity Snaps

Pictures of the activities of settle-
ment night and last year’s Blackfriars
are especially sought after by the art
staff of the Cap and Gown. Such con-
tributions should be brought to Lex-
ington Hall at the earliest possible
date.

Contributions, both literary and
art, will still be received. Under a well
regulated reporter system the work
is progressing with scarcely a hitch,
well over half of the copy having
been already prepared.

Sophs Delight In
Sporting Plumes

At Rakish Angles

Sophomore feathers have come and
♦one!

Three hundred and fifty crimson
plumes ordered for the members of
the sophomore class have all been sold,
and were seen on the hats of the ma-
jority of the class after chapel yes-
terday. Enthusiastic sophomores were
still clamoring for feathers after they
had all been sold.

An amazing variety of styles were
perceived in the adoption of the new
symbol of class spirit. Feathers tuck
straight up in front or in back like
Indian braves, or draped gracefully
like those in the famous Gainsborough
portraits, or broken off to a mere bit
of the original ten inch quill were ob-
served as the Sophomores strutted
around campus, conscious of their new
distinction.

OPEN CHAPEL FOR

VESPER SERVICES

Hold Christmas Program in
Bond Chapel Sunday

Joseph Bond chapel will be opened
Sunday at 4:30, for the first time to
a saudent’s Christmas vesper service
sponsored by the Y. W. C. A.

The unique feature of the service
will be the absence of a sermon. Dr.
A. E. Holt, professor of Social Ethics,
at the Chicago Theological Seminary,

will officiate; while Norris L. Tibbets,
assistant pastor of the Hyde Park
Baptist church, will lead in the sing
ing of familiar Christmas carols. The
choir under the direction of Mr. Mack

Evans will carol outside the church
to the congregation within. Eleanor
French, organist, and Arthur Giese,
flutist and cellist, will play for the
services.

Miriam Walker, secretary of the Y.
W. C. A., is in charge of the program.

Blackfriars Plan
Class In Dancing
To Train Chorus

To train men for the chorus of the
1927 Blackfriars production a dancing
class will be started in the Winter
quarter. Full physical culture credit
will be given all students. The class
will meet four times a week under
the direction of Hamilton Coleman, in
the Reynolds Club theatre from 1:30
to 2:00 and registration for it mav
be made in Bartlett gymnasium the
first week of next quarter.

“Opportunities for advanced instruc-
tion will be offered those with previous
training. Much interest has been,
shown since the first announcement,
and it seems likely that the class will
be crowded,” according to Phillip
Watrous, Abbot of Blackfriars. It is
not limited to advanced students.

EXAM SCHEDULES

Classes will be held as usual next
Monday but Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday will be devoted to the
final examinations th e schedule for

A petition by the students at the
University of Wisconsin for an earlier
and longer Christmas vacation result-
eel in a motion by the faculty grant-
ing a two days’ extension, changing
the dates from December 22 until Jan-
uary 6 to December 18 until
January 4. The students here
may be enviohs of the lucky Bad-
gers for the vacation extends from De-

and cookies have been planned. Ruth
Marshall, a graduate student in the
C. and A. school is in charge of the
affair.

Atlas and Peter

Pan Will Travel
For Three Months

Whether it was the gold inkwell in
the form of a ship that gave them the
idea, Peter Pan and Atlas neglected to
say. What they did say was that Mr.
and Mrs. Bill Solenburger, to use their
real names instead of noms de plume,
intend dropping out of school next
quarter and traveling for three months
on the money given them as wedding
presents, when they recently surprised
the campus by announcing their mar-
riage.

Mrs. Solenburger was anxious to
have it known that the inkwell was
not the only gift they received and
declared that she wanted a good chance
to try out an electric percolator, chaf-
ing dish, some goblets and numerous
other presents. Atlas and Ptter Pan
will return to the University in April.

Enlighten World At College
Says President In
Speech

College is not a place for scholar-
ship for itself, but for enlightening
the world through scholarship.”

With this as the text of his address
President Max Mason dedicated the
cornerstone of Wieboldt Hall, the new-
modern language building, yesterday
at 2:30 in Harper Assembly hall. Work
on this structure was begun April,
1925, and completion is contemplated
for next fall.

W. A. Wieboldt, president of the
Wieboldt Foundation, through whose
benevolence the new edifice was made
possible, laid the stone assisted by
Mrs. Wieboldt. “We know that the
benefactions of philanthropy are not
as beneficial to mankind as the day
by day work of education.” Mr. Wie-
boldt declared. “Hard work without a
college education is better than a col-
lege education without hard work,” he
summarized.

“Phil” Allen Speaks

Philip Schuyler Allen, Professor and
acting chairman of the department of
Germanic Languages and Literature,
was the principal speaker of the occa-
sion. Speaking on “Meaning of Wie-
boldt Hall” Mr. Allen asserted that
“The new building will revitalize the
work in modern language. Due to in-
crease' in prestige, the modern lan-
guages are now able to sell themselves
to the students.”

MILITARY BALL

IMMEDIATELY after Christmas, we always begin to think about
* the Military Ball and with great foresight lay away our pennies
and nickels, until we have accumulated the price of a ticket. The
Military ball rates as one of the hot affairs of the year.

We have heard rumors from the sources that always rumor on
campus that some of the local authorities do not approve the exten-
sion of the Military party to the whole school. The dissenting au-
thorities claim that it is strictly an army dance and that it should be
confined to army men; that the $1000 or more that the ball runs
into is too much for such a dance and that there are too many like
occasions during the year.

Last year the ball was one of the most perfect of the season.
Music, lighting, crowd.... everything was exquisite. It was one of
those kind of dances of which the club secretary remarks in his notes,
“a good time was had by all.”

Our own inclinations have never been warlike. We would hate
to be deprived of the privilege of attending one of the best of the
year’s dances, because of the fact that we don’t own a uniform.
Moreover, the Military ball draws its crowd not through any bally-
hoo methods, but on its reputation. These are too many artificially
supported institutions on campus at present and when we find one
that has as its backing only the desire of the crowd for one good
time, and when that good time comes through, then we are in favor
of letting it ride as is.

VESPERS

WHEN MIRIAM WALKER of the Y. W. C. A. told us that the
’’ annual Christmas vesper services will be held next Sunday in
the new Bond Chapel, and that there will be singing and other de-
votional services, and that there will be no sermon, we immedi-
ately thought, ‘That’s a good idea.” Bond Chapel is very much in
the Christmas picture, and sermons are very much out of the picture.
It should be good, this vesper service.

Cap-

Alyea, center, was the only reg-
to be lost by graduation and with
return of Hoerger and McDon-

ough, star guards who ranked second
only to Hogan and McConnell of Iowa
last year, Chicago is assured of an-
other strong defensive team. Marks is
an able understudy for a guard post.
Last season the Maroons were noted
as the wreckers of title hopes in the
Big Ten, upsetting the leaders at cri-
tical times, largely through their air-
tight defense. Captain Sackett and
Zimmerman are the returning for-
wards who will try to improve their
basket eyes. Gist is being groomed
for a trial at center and Kaplan may
work at forward if he shoot baskets
well enough.

Walter Eckersall tells you why foot-

the pastime of picking All American
Teams. You’ll be interested in all of
these.

Wallie Marks, Captain of the 1926
Grid Team, gives his own version of
the past season in. a highly interesting
article. Coach Nels Norgren tells of
the educational advantages of the re-
cent Japan trip made by the Maroon
ball team, while Jimmie Webster, stel-

high lights of that history making

swimming as a major sport, while
Coach Merrill has a masterful article
on the sport of Fencing. Another high-

Rockne’s Record
At Notre Dame
Speaks Volumes

Winning 82 out of 92 games has
been the record of Knute Rockne
since his debut in coaching at Notre
Dame. Ever since 1918 he has been
at the helm of the football teams, and
by compiling such a record he is look-
ed upon as being without doubt one
of the three leading coaches in the
country.

It is Rockne that saw the possibil-
ities in the forward pass, and he began
using this means of offense as soon,

as

it was made legal. It was

Rockne that developed the idea of the
“shock troops” being sent in to open

TRACK SQUAD RESTS
HOPES ON EFFORTS
OF VARIOUS STARS

a

The Midway track squad boast of
few exceptional stars this year. An-

ton Burg, Conference champion high
jumper who has jumped six feet seven
inches is the outstanding man on the
squad. Captain Jimniy Cusack ex-
captain and Captain McKinney, sprint-
er and hurdler are the other two let-
ter men. There is enough talent on
the team, however, to give most of
the conference squads a good run in
dual meets. In the fifty yard dash,
McKinney, Gleason and George Reed
are the outstanding men. And Brandt
Weddell are fair men. In the hurdles
McKinney, Bob Spence and Weddell
are all promising performers.

COACHES, PRESIDENTS WILL MEET
TO CLEAR UP PRESENT POINTS AT

ISSUE IN CONFERENCE ATHLETICS

Rotating Schedule, Determination of Championships,
Eligibility, Some of the Topics That

Will Be Discussed

A special meeting of six representa-
tives from each of the ten Conference
universities will be held in Chicago
jit the Hotel Sherman the last of Jan-
uary. At the time of the recent con-
ference of the athletic directors and

football

coaches when the football

Evanston, 111., Dec. 9.—Northwest-
ern’s basketball squad was cut to 15
men this week.

With only three regulars from last
year on the squad, the prospect for
a strong team appears doubtful at this
stage. Followers of the team have
high expectations of Fisher, Rusch and
Baker, the three veterans who will
attempt to carry the team through the
forthcoming season.

In Waldo Fisher, Coach Kent has
a center who won high honors during
his first year on the squad, and is ex-
pected to be one of the leading cen-
ters in the Conference again this sea-
son. He has put on weight since last
year and emerged from the football
season without serious injury.

Bobby Rusch, diminutive player
"ho did an able job as forward last
season, is cavorting about the floor
with all his old time effectiveness. He
with team with Baker at the forward
assignments. Other forwards who are
making a strong bid for a regular job
are Hathaway from last year's team,
and Welsh, Morgan and McKay, all
sophomores.

A plentiful assortment of guards is
on hand. Among the most promising
are Smith, Heideman, Levison and
Johnson, all sophomdres. Sachse and
Foster from last year’s team also are
working industriously for positions.

A fullback with the drive of Layden,
a quarter with the brains of Stuhl-
dreher and a pair of halves with the
speed of Crowley and Miller would
have made any coach cheerful for the
rest of his life.

Rockne’s record of 82 wins is all'
the more remarkable when one consid-
ers the schedules he picks out, and
the amount of traveling his teams are
forced to do year after year. They
have earned the nickname of “Ram-
blers,” and rightly so. During the
1926 season they traveled from New
York to Los Angeles, and from Chi-
cago to Atlanta, stopping at such inter-
mediate points as Pittsburgh, Minne-
apolis and South Bend.

It was the Pittsburg date that de-
finitely ruined the Notre Dame men-
tor’s dream of a national title this
year. While he was attending the
Army-Navy game in Chicago the Car-
negie Tech squad tripped the South
Benders by a 19-9 score, which proves
that it is never to late to learn.

Until this year Notre Dame has
been accustomed to playing a nine or

schedule was made up for nevt year,
the need of such a meeting was sug-
gested and the group decided to re-
quest the ten. university presidents, the
ten chairmen of the Boards of Re-
gents, the ten faculty representatives
and an alumnus from each of the uni-
versities to meet with the directors
and football coaches for the purpose
of determining future policies of the
Conference and to assist in further
equalizing Conference competition. It
was decided today that this meeting
would be held some time late in Jan-
uary and practically all the persons
named above have signified their will-
ingness to attend such a meeting.

2—Schedules—The question of ro-
tating schedules, simultaneous home
and home games, long term contracts
and intersectional games will be dis-
cussed.

3—Equality of competition. As it is
necessary that two teams competing
in a game shall observe one code of
playing rules, so that the Conference
authorities are agreed in the interests
of equal and fair competition that it is
further necessary that the ten Confer-
ence universities respect uniformity in
•the matters which pertain to playing
conditions off the field. For instance,
the directors will request the presi-

dents, faculty representatives,

the

alumni and the others to assist them

in reaching a

uniform agreement

Among the
cussed at this

ing:

matters that
meeting are

will be dis-
the follow-

1—Is the
league? The

Conference

a playing

Conference was origin-

ally constituted for the purpose of es-
tablishing eligibility rules common to
all of the institutions which make up
the Conference and for the purpose of
establishing athletic standards. A great
many of the alumni and the public are
insisting, however, that the Conference
should determine championships each
year and with that in mind are insist-
ing that schedules be arranged for

which shall affect the ten universities
alike in the matter or remission of tui-
tion, the granting of scholarships, loan
funds, the activities of alumni secre-
taries and so forth. The Directors be-
lieve that while there is very little
preselyting and illegitimate recruiting
on the part of the Conference univer-
sities, yet they realize that there has
been no prescribed uniform standard
binding all the universities alike in the
past.

This meetng should be of great
value in assisting in the constructive
work of the Conference and since all
phases of university life will be repre-
sented will probably be more far
reaching in consequence than any
Conference meeting previously held.
