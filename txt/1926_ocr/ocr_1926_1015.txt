Well, the boys got their pep sesion.
They had a long, hard battle to do it,
but truth and justice triumphed in
the end. The faculty, you know, was
set against it. Like Comstocks pour-
ing the Demon Rum down, the sewer
after a successful raid on the village
drug store, they have through the
years drained off all the “college” in
a place that never, in its most inspired
moments, was ever even passably col-
legiate. With the empty bottles (to
continue my figure) lying empty and
apparently harmless in the gutter, the
authorities still felt that things were
not entirely according to the (faculty)
heart’s desire They wanted to get
rid of the faint whiff that still clung
inside the liqnor jugs? Hence the in-
terdict against pep sessions.

But the boys showed fight. They
did not sit passively back and take
what the authorities saw fit to dish
out to them. Nay! They lay back
their ears and howled. Their cheer
leaders stormed the Dean’s office.
Waves of public opinion made the at-
mosphere of Cobb 204 unbearable.
The Dean and the rest relented. They
allowed the hoys their pep session.
It was, the boys feel in looking back,
a nice pep session. Fully a half dozen

traffic rules

were broken. The Old

Man, trying to make a speech, was
drowned out by hoarse throats shout-
ing his name to the heavens. Such was
the milling over at the Englewood

Station that

A nice time—very nice,

from the pep session—nice as it was.

Graduate and professional students
are to have their own clubhouse, ac-
cording to Edgar N. Johnson of the
Graduate Club Executive Committee.
Their new rendezvous will be situated
between the Quadrangle Club and the
Phi Kappa Sigma house on Univer-
sity Avenue, and will be open in the
near future for the use of these stu-
dents.

The equipment for the new house
has not been provided as yet. The
University first desires to know what
facilities the students will most de-
sire. Accordingly the Fellows Club
will hold a meeting in Harper As-
sembly Room, Tuesday, October nine-
teenth, at twelve o’clock, noon. The
meeting will be devoted to gathering
ideas for the equipping and furnish-
ing of the new house.

This is the first step the Univer-
sity has taken to make the student
body of the University socially and
actively felt, according to the execu-
tive committee. With a clubhouse on
the campus it is believed that the
professional students will play a
more active role in University life.
They outnumber the undergraduates
almost two to one.

The new club house was formerly
the Theological building situated on
the corner of 57th Street anfi Uni-

afternoon, according to Gudrun
Egeberg, who is in charge of the
affair. Although the game starts

Speaking of college life (we were,

Champaign tonight and see it in the
rah. (I dedicate that little quip to the
blessed memory of Sew Covert, now
wearing short pants in his capacity
of Field Executive for the Boy Scouts
of America—PERIOD, as Phil Allen
says). For long months the charges
of Wilfrid O. Cross have been spoiling
my sleep. One of the dear old Hitch-
cock Hall boys, I could not believe
all those things about the boys and
girls down at the Twin Cities. And
so, I’m going down to see for myself
if Mr. Cross was right. It’ll be Home-
coming, so I’ll have just about the
best opportunity of the year of seeing
the seamy side of things (if any). Of
caurse, much as it grieves me, I shall
be unable to report to my followers
what the conditions are. For to say
that I found the charges of Mr. Cross
entirely unfounded would be a confes-

Mr. Al Kruez was the nemesis of
the Maroons at Penn last year. He
might have been again this year but
for Mr. Thayer, present captain of the
Quakers. Kruez was the logical man
for captain, but since he was Kruez
and a native of Manistee (Mich.) or
some other such place, and the other
candidate was Thayer, of the PHIL-
ADELPHIA THAYERS, he was did
out of the job. Kruez played on Kal-
amazoo Normal, or (again) some such
place, for a year before he went to
Penn. The fact wasn’t mentioned un-
til Mr. Thayer decided he wanted
to be captain. Then it was dug out
of the dust, and the decree was made
that the year at Kalamazoo barred
Kruez from playing the full three
years at Penn. And that, children, is
why Thayer is captain, and also why

SEISMOGRAPH SHOWS
THREE EARTHQUAKES
WITHIN PAST WEEK

By Milton S. Mayer

When his physicians told him that
he was losing his sight, some ten
years ago, Prof. Edwin B. Frost,
director of the. Yerkes Observatory,
decided to sacrifice priceless eyes on
the altar of science.

Last December gave birth to the
news that the Copernicus of the cen-
tury had become totally blind.

And now we learn that Mars, the
possibly inhabited world that virtu-
ally rebounded from the earth two
years ago, is due for another neigh-
borly visit. It is Prof. Frost, the

about that rough fellow Al Kruez, man who one year ago had “spent his

Saturday.

light in the heavens he loved,” who

be at a distance of 42,680,000 miles
from the earth.

Prof. Frost has done the impos-
sible—he has eaten his cake and still
has it. His wisdom peers through
the giant Yerkes telescope with a
sharper pair of eyes than his. And
with the characteristic optimisism
and determination that have already
won him his niche among' the undy-
ing, Prof. Frost knows that he will
see again.

Prof. Frost is an old man.

The whole business makes us think
of someone’s poem that ends,—“Name
me not with the defeated, for tomor-
row again I begin!”

Taking a railroad apart to see what makes it go is a
process which is bound to uncover information of gen*
eial interest. The traveling and shipping public is
fairly well acquainted with the movement of trains, but
the activities.of a railroad cover far more than that.

The operating department is charged with the run-
ning of trains and the maintenance of the railroad and
of its equipment.

The purchasing department must spend economically
the millions of dollars that go into the channels of trade
annually for the materials and supplies essential to rail-
way operation and must store and distribute these
articles in an effective manner.

The traffic department is charged with building up
and maintaining the volume of business of a railroad,

THE GRADUATES COME TO LIFE

/^N the heels of the announcement of organization plans for the
new graduate club comes the information that twelve graduate
teams have been entered in intramural competition. These have
been drawn from the professional schools and the dormitories. The
new graduate club across the tennis courts from the Quadrangle club
is seeking to get the campus graduate students solidly behind it to
form an organization unique in American universities. The apathy
which our numerous and scholastically distinguished graduate body
has proverbally shown to campus life seems about to depart.

As undergraduates we welcome this awakening on the part of
our once "silent partners.” Graduate campus spirit and graduate
activities will of course be different than those in which undergrad-
uates participate. But when the most numerous group on the quad-
rangles emerges from its laboratories and libraries to enter into a
more intimate companionship, to live more of a university life in
the broadest sense of that phrase, we will have an atmosphere here
unlike anything else in the country. We give the graduates our praise
and encouragement in their new undertaking.

“FATHER’S DAY”

'T'HOSANDS of fathers will be on the campus next Saturday, Oct.
■*• 2 3 to look us over. They will tour the campus, see the Chicago-
Purdue football game, dine together and attend a student vaudeville
program. They will have a first opportunity to view the University
and its students while in action.

The plan of a “Father’s Day” is a brand new one at the Uni-
versity but we think it will succeed and should succeed for it will fur-
nish an opportunity for a close contact between father and student
and between father and the University.

Dean Boucher has ventured the opinion that the fathers will go
away with greater confidence and assurance that their children are
being well taken care of. And after all that is worth while, for our
fathers and should attend to making reservations for football tickets
daughters.

Though letters have
graduate, some 3,300 in
with the students. They
fathers and should attend

been sent to the father of every under-
all, the success of the plan rests largely
should write letters of invitation to their
o making reservations for football tickets

in the special block of seats set aside by Coach Stagg.

We think it a good plan fraternities and clubs to arrange spe-
cial luncheons for the fathers of their members and pledges and for
the non-fraternity students to plan to take lunch with their fathers
on Saturday noon. That is the only part of he day’s entertainment
that has not been arranged by the committee in charge of the event.

President Max Mason, Coach Alonzo A. Stagg and Dean
-hauncey Boucher are behind the project. They see the importance
of forming closer contacts with our fathers.

For example, only about one-sixth of the railway
employes of the country are engaged directly in train
service. Just as in wartime the front-line trenches are
occupied by only a relatively small part of an army, so
in the railway service there are several employes in sup-
port and reserve for every one who directly provides
transportation by manning the trains.

Most railroads of any size are organized by depart-
ments, each reporting to a vice-president or officer of
equal rank, although both the relative importance of
the departments and the rank of the officers in charge
vary from road to road. The executive department
ordinarily consists of the president and the heads of
the various other departments and therefore is not a
distinct line of work in itself, although in recent years
it has added to its administrative functions in many
instances the specialized duty of developing and main-
taining pleasant relations with the public.

The accounting and treasury department keeps the
records of the railroad and takes in and pays out its
millions of- dollars of annual receipts and expenditures.

The law department safeguards the interests of the
railroad in the courts and out, making sure in advance
that all the activities of the railroad conform to law and
to the many intricacies of railway regulation.

In addition to these ordinarily major departments,
there are a good many other departments almost equally
essential to railway operation but grouped under these
larger departments for convenience in organization.
Many of these minor departments provide distinct lines
of work in themselves, calling for the best efforts of
skilled business and professional men and offering re-
wards commensurate with those to be found in cor-
responding lines of work outside the railroads.

Disclosure Of Scandal

Rouses Illinois Campus

TWO POEMS

ON THE BOARDS '

Coming on the heels of this week’s
discovery of one of our own stu-
dents who, in accordance with the
popular style of razzing one’s Alma
Mater, had written a more or less
inaccurate impression of the Univer-
sity for the New Student magazine,
we have this apt editorial from the
Illinois Siren:

The Sin Cities

“From Podunk to Hayloft Junc-
tion, the rocking chair fleet has hoist-
ed shuddering elbows as Illinois
crashed into the Scandal Section.

For Willy Cross has went and
told. He has Exposed us; with one
magnificent gesture he has swept off
the man-hole cover and revealed all
Illini basking in tile slime of our own
sewer. He‘has exposed the Vice, Vil-
liany and Vulgarity of Urbana and
the Shams of Champaign; he has ex-

Why does the Theater Magazine
disappear at 3 o’clock every Friday
afternoon and not appear again un-
til Monday? Why is every copy of
the American Photoplay taken per-
manently? The periodical depart-
ment in Harper library subscribes to
3500 magazines, but about twenty
of these which are used most fre-
quently are taken and never return-
ed.

The number that disappear is very
small compared to the number re-
ceived, but it is the time and effort
required to replace them that makes
their disappearance a problem. The
issue of the Dial for July, 1924, is
still missing in spite of the work of
several agencies in tracing a copy.
Some bound volumes have been cut
and tom, and these may never be
able to be replaced.

When a fifteen cent magazine dis-
appears it sometimes costs the library
more than five times its original cost
to replace it. An order for a period-
ical has to be checked by five clerks
before it reaches the dealer. When
a magazine is received it goes
through five other clerks. All this
causes expenses and trouble that
would be unnecessary if the readers
were more social in their attitudes,
according to the librarian.

By Lucille Price-Benedict

We who have all, at one time or
another suffered at the hands of evil-
meaning sympathetic relatives, re-
joice that Miss Macaulay in her
“Crewe Train’” makes them the
target of her sparkling satire. We
feel revenge for the injuries done us!
Mr. Dobie, a retired minister, fUd to
Andorra to escape the demands of
social life. There he raised his
motherless daughter, or rather al-
lowed his daughter to raise herself.
At the age of twenty-one, we find
Denham, a healthy, lazy, sloppy,
indifferent young animal, asking
nothing of the world but to be left
alone. Her indolent happiness was
doomed by an outrageous promoter
who started a bus line to Andorra,
and thus opened a way for relatives
to follow. Five of them arrived on
the first bus, and Mr. Dobie died of
the shock. They were kind-hearted
relatives and realized at once that
something had to be done about Den-
ham, so they took her to London.
What London did to Denham, and
Denham did to London, and how 's
enougm to fill anyone with mirth.
This is Rose Macaulay at her best.

"The Unearthly”

Robert Hicjien’s “The Unearthly”
falls far below the market by “The
Garden of Allah.’” Imogen Lowrie,
a g»y, selfish, young intellectual was
toying with the idea of marrying
Hugo Dennistone, who boasted six-
feet of handsome body, but a small
percentage of brain capacity. While
she was dallying Hugo, she met Peter
Kharhoff. Peter is meant to be the
last word in Messiahs, but he isn’t,
and that is where the author fails to
convince us. Shortly after Imogen
met Peter, Hugo became hopelessly

posed the little Crimson Schoolhouse
in all its secret abandon. And he has
said that we’re not nice.

But just when the details were
growing deliciously dirty, the right-
eous, and Johnny Solon, have risen
with a voice of thunder; and Willy
has been really severely rebuked.
And the spinsters are reverting to
wine baths and the goings-on in Hol-
lywood, Cal.

So the Siren, with the superiority
of a professional sinner, only adds
her own announcement that Willy is
v^ong, and declares wearily that
the sins of Illinois are few and am-
ateur, and that the academy is 99.44
percent pure. And that there are no
whirlpools of vice, no drunken Sat-
urnalian orgies of Riot and Revelry,
of Drunkenness and Debauchery, of
Lust and Licentiousness, of Sin and
Saliciousness.

No—damn it!

He’s just like anybody else. Of
course he would be. But somehow a
man who has gone on two hunting ex-
peditions to the interior of Africa and
is planning his third—well, I thought
he ought to look different. But he’s
just a tall, gray-haired man, in a gray
suit, kind and anxious to please.

But when he led me up the narrow
stairs to his library on the roof, Her-
bert E. Bradley was the traveler again.
He was in the atmosphere of the
Africa he loved. He began to talk
—about amber beads, okapi skins,
Edna Ferber, afternoon tea, sports
and Artie Scott.

And then he showed me his various
collections. Skins of the animals he
and Mrs. Bradley had shot,* covered
the floor, hung over the chairs and
were draped across the tables. Above
the book-shelves which surrounded
the room were the heads of a buffalo,
kob and topi. There were several ele-
phant tusks in a corner of the room.
Spears and arrows, shields of buffalo
hide, carved elephant’s tusks, gorilla
death masks—in fact everything one
could think of from the wild jungles
of Africa.

And to finish it off were the books
written by Mary Bradley on their
trips. The explorer’s pride in his
wife’s work, as well as his love for the
little golden-haired daughter, Alice,
showed us another side of his nature.



OFF THE SHELF

YE LITERATI'

crippled in an accident. Since Imo-
gen’s only interest in Hugo had been
his splendid body and fine sports-
manship, and now all that was ruined
she no longer cared for him. But the
attitude of her set, which expected
her to stand by Hugo and marry him
in spite of the accident, seemed to
trap her. In despair she turned to
Peter for help, and thru his influence
she evolved out of her troubles a
conventional “new woman.” The
problem of whether Imogen should
marry Hugo or not is stretched out
to such length that it becomes dull
and stupid.

“Daphne Bruno”

“Daphne Bruno” is another story
that is too long winded. Mr. Ray-
mond could have told his tale in one
volume by omitting non-essentials.
However, “Daphne Bruno” does have
the virtue of sustaining the reader’s
interest straight to the end. The first
volume tells of Daphne’s youth and
love affairs; the second shows how
her experiences help her to prevent
her daughter, Eve, from becoming the
mistress of an actor. The actor de-
serves to be especially commended for
his remarkable skill in developing his
characters.

“It’s Not Done”

William C. Bullit in “It’s Not
Done”, tells the woes of a married
couple who are not sexually suited,
tho in other respects the union Is a
happy one. John has an abundant
supply of animal spirits, but he
wants them satisfied in a romantic
and delicate manner. His wife on
the other hand can only respond to
“cave-man’’ treatment. Their quest
for satisfaction is treated frankly,
and yet with a certain delicacy seldom
shown in books of this type.

SOCIALLY SPEAKING

To-day Chicago’s football team
left for the game with Pennsylvania.
And how Chicago loves to send off a
team! The celebration started in
front of Mitchell Tower at twelve-
twenty; and enthusiastic rooters ac-
companied the players to the Engle-
wood Union Station. We rather think
the members of the traveling public
who happened to be around enjoyed
the send-off as much as anyone.

Phi Gamma Delta is having a
party on Friday the fifteenth of Octo-
ber. The Phi Gams usually have
good parties, and we see no reason to
believe this one will be an exception.
We remember a hard times party last
fall that was a wow.

Friday the fifteenth is also the
date of a dinner given by the Inter-
national Students Association.

Since the football game is at Penn
this week, there will probably be
fewer teas. However Delta Sigma
has registered a radio tea Saturday,
and several more of these are ex-
pected. Listening to a football game
over the radio has at least one ad-
vantage. You don’t go home with a
sore throat.

Saturday there will be a house
dance given by the pledges of Phi
Delta Theta. We wonder if their
success with decorations during Inter-
scholastic will induce the brothers to
do a little interior decorating for
their parties. We hope so. We’d
like to see fraternity parties a little
different than the usual dance-and-
eat affair.

And tho it’s none of our business
really—may we remind you to regis-
ter your parties as soon as your
chaperons have accepted.

This is our debut. Our aim is to
please, and we hope we are accom-
plishing our aim. But we can do that
only with the co-operation of* the cam-
pus.

Do you write? or do you like to
write? or possibly you just feel that
you could write. If you do, we want
to hear from you. This Friday feature
supplement is to bring a new phase
of journalism to campus publications.
It is not entirely new. It is what the
Circle attempted in magazine form at
one time.

Feature stories, book reviews, the-
atrical reviews, interviews and poetry
will appear on this weekly section.
It is an opportunity for everyone who
would like to write articles of this sort
to express themselves in print, and
we hope they will. We want the orig-
inal work that only you can contribute.
Are you willing to help?

To a Girl With a Sharp Tongue

By George Leo Gruskin
Thy word, perhaps, were said for
only spite—

I can’t believe you meant to be un-
kind,

Else, why that last long look? What
cruel delight

Is yours—What pleasure do you find
In tearing at my heart? Am I like
stone,

You think, devoid of human feeling?
Ah, no my Dear. We two alone

Can glimpse the love your darts are
stealing.

Taft Expresses

Faith In Youth

“Youth has talent but no training,”
said Lorado Taft, leading American
sculptor, in a recent interview. “I
have faith in their abilities, although
American art as a whole has shown
a lack of inspiration for some time.”

“Our young people have many la-
tent, artistic possibilities which need
only to be brought out by training in
appreciation and originality. There
is not enough originality in a great
deal of our American art,” said Mr.
Taft. “It is a jumble of motifs bor-
rowed from the past, having no spe-
cial connection with our modern life.
While these things meant much to
the people who created them, they
mean nothing to us. When the Goth-
ic style was in full bloom, one of its
characteristics was that the orna-
mental details of a building were tak-
en from the flowers of that region.
The people put themselves and their
lives into their art. That is part of
the definition of Gothic art today.
Modern art has lost that knack. Our
people simply copy those old details
as the Romanesque style copied
things from other work. Our minds
are not active. Americans do not
use the things about them.

“An enterprising architect will
take the significant, decorations from
some old tomb and put them on a
great business block in an American
city. So you see copies of skulls of
cattle, garlands, and festoons on mod-
ern buildings. I believe there is one
building in New York where they ac-
tually have, as a part of the decora-
tions the lachrymal urns to hold the
tears of the mourners.”

In speaking of the progress toward
better art work Mr. Taft said; “In
my life I have noticed a wonderful
progress. There is a very greatly in-
creased interest in these things.
There is talent budding in every
school. All that we need is the en-
couragement that comes from appre-
ciation, and there will be no end of
good art production in this country.
Our young people need the encour-
agement to back their talent.

“I deplore the fact,” he said,
speaking of opportunities for art ap-
preciation, “that there is very little
to inspire art even in our larger
communities. I want to see a great
temple of art at our State University
which is a place where young people
come to live for four years, their
eyes open to all kinds of wonders of
science and literature. The same is
true of Chicago. We have advan-
tages here, and things are developing
but we have little of beauty to of-
fer the eager-eyed young people who
are looking for inspiration to last
all their lives.”

By William Jost, Jr.

In view of the despotic autocracy
of comedy-drama, comedy and musi-
cal revue and the humiliating sub-
jugation of intelligent emotional
drama it is no small wonder that the
cinema generates hourly, the Little
Theater group weekly and the fire-
place library monthly.

An even more astouding surprise
however is the fact that these
comedy-dramas, comedies and danc-
ing revues are able and cunning
enough to keep the proletariat public
so long amused. Even the most petu-
lant critic of the current theatre con-
cedes the premise that one of every
three plays is so enthralling as to
cause the auditor to forget that he
wanted to leave early to catch the
last express.

The Poor Nut

“The Poor Nut” is one such
comedy. Elliot Nugent, a graduate
’of Ohio State, if I am informed cor-
rectly, with assistance of Nugent Sr.
wrote the libretic and has done with
it, as good, perhaps a triffle better
than if it had been written by a popu-
lar magazine fiction writer. The part
better is that portion pertaining to
the rushing of John Miller by the Psi
Sigma boys. You see, the play spins
around the locale of Ohio State Uni-
versity, the track team, the book
store and the fraternity lounge and
all else that John Allison imparted to
you in The Phoenix

As a pioneering college play, cut-
ting down the underbrush and blaz-
ing the trees of what will later come
to be known as the “Do’s and Don’ts
of College Plays” it registers quite
well. The^e lies within the lines all
the wise college wrinkles which are
never said by college men, but which
people still believe college men crack
and so most every one laughs up-
roariously. There stands in the struc-
ture of the play all the incidents and
scenes of university life which one
may discern in the cinema and in
gaudy embellished periodicals, but the
simple souled theatre goer believes he
is being led in on the ground floor of
college and sits tense and overawed.
Nugent is capital as the “Poor Nut”,
and Norma Lee as the winsome he-
roine, and Betty Garde as the vixen.
For the sake of seeing the theatrical
mirror of the p< pular conception of
“college”, for the enjoyment to be de-
rived from Mr. Nugent, the play
merits your attendance.

“First Love”

What Fay Bainter and Bruce Mc-
Rae try to make of this Shubert pro-
duction in the Selwyn is something
quite like a vodvil skit, something
almost consanguineous to a “La Pari-
essien.” It is so edifiyng, so enlight-
ening, that had a novice nun witnes-
sed the performance, she would at
■once praise the blessing giver for

having so heartlessly deprived the
world from more plays like this. And
I am not so sure but what the most
calloused night-lifer, would have as-
sented to her thanksgiving. In short,
if all the theatres in town were pad-
locked, save the Selwyn. Your best
bet would be the movies. The origi-
nal play “Pile ou Face” comes from
the illustrious Louis Verneuil, but I
rather suspect—and with hope—that
the adaptation has been shamelessly
distorted.

The fundamental principle, spins
’round a dishinerited musician and
his consort who live together in ut-
ter poverty. They are given two op-
portunities for wealth; he to marry
his father’s partner’s daughter, and
she, the chance to obtain all she
wants from a wealthy baron for what
she terms the “selling” of herself.
The play terminates in all the good
taste of a Rex Beach novel. The
hero clasps the heroine to his breast
and sneers derisively at his forebear;
who pleads for the son’s forgiveness
with the family jewels and the bank
roll in either fist.

You have heard of Fay Bainter and*
possibly have had the pleasure of
auditing some of her performances.
She is cunning, dainty and exceeding-
ly adept at frisking and skipping and
is miracuously adroit. She amuses
with skill and entertains with capa-
bility. Mr. McRae turns in for the
most part a sonorous exhibition and
does whatever he can to build up, by
his own efforts^a flimsy, wabbly play,
which has for its sole excuse for exis-
tance, a good idea and an unoccupied
theatre.

“The Coconuts”

The Erlanger Theater broke its
shell the other evening with the open-
ing of this new vehicle for thp Marx
Brothers. The Erlanger is just the
old Palace renamed, but “The Coco-
nuts” is a new play for the funni-
est frolickers on the stage, each re-
plated with a bag of new tricks.
There are, I suspect, actors tvho are
regarded by some evaluators of the.
theatre superior to these buffons, but
for me, that evaluator errs. •
