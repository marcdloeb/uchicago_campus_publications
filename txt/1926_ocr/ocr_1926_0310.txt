Board a bus in Chicago and you
may give your fare to a college man.
Hire a dectective, nurse or chauffeur
' and it is likely that a student will
report for duty. Even the bread you
eat may have been baked by a stu-
dent of liberal arts.

Ninety percent of the undergradu-
ate population at the University are
holding eighty-five different kinds of
jobs in the city of Chicago, earning
all or part of their way through col-
lege, it is shown in an analysis of
student employment made public at
the University. The statistics con-
trovert the notion that the college
man is a loafer and show that he
will avail himself of any honest oc-
cupation.

Student Drive* Plane

Public attention was first drawn to
the employment bureau at the Uni-
versity when it was revealed a year
ago that one student commuted from

Cleveland, Ohio,
on a mail plane,
another man was
side of the city

Novelty songs and music written
by students of the University will ap-
pear in a preliminary tryout to be held
Friday at 4 :30 in the Reynolds thea-
tre under the auspices of Blackfriars.
This contest affords an opportunity
to present all novelty music, clever
songs and musical representations
with or without words, whether it is
designed for the show or not.

The choice of songs for the Black-
friars annual production will by no
means Ik influenced by the showing
of this contest. According to Paul
Cullom, Abbot of Blackfriars, this
presentation of music is held merely
to get a general idea of the novelty
music that has been written by stu-
dents of the University, that the
judges may know merely what to ex-
pect when the tryouts come about.
A contest of this kind affords a wider
scope of music than will the actual
tryouts; acordingly, Paul Cullom
urges all composers of the University
to “exhibit their wares” as well as
'heir ability.

The figures for 1926 show occupa-

bread. These men start at two in
the morning, work for eight hours

Japanese students of the University
will endeavor to show real Japanese life
through their native art and spirit. Ac-
cording to Tomonori Takei, president of
the Japanese Students Christian associa-
tion, the program will be worth-while
and entertaining. Scats will not be re-
served and tickets may be purchased for
fifty cents from members of the club.
Further details will be published in The
Daily Maroon early next quarter.

This program is being presented
in the hope that a little money may
be raised through it to contribute to
an orphanage for Japanese children
pow existing in California, according
to Takei, who says that it is badly in
need of finanical assistance. The
proceeds from Japan Night are
usually donated to a worthy charity.

The chairman of the banquet com-
mittee, Marion Woolsey, and her co-
workers, Irene Erp, Henrietta De
Costa, Dorothy Thompson and Cecil
Jonkman, are planning to have a typ-
ically Roman affair, yet differing from
the banquet of previous years. Fol-
lowing the dinner, Margaret Novak,
president of the club and toastmistress
for the evening, will introduce the
speakers—Prof. Charles H. Beeson of
the Latin department, and Mr. Alfred
P. Dorjahn, instructor in the depart-
ment of Greek.

Tickets for the banquet may be pro-
cured from members of the club for
75 cents.

The Eta Sigma Phi annual ban-
quet is always a unique one, accord-
ing to Margaret Novak, president of
the club. This year’s affair is to be
thoroughly novel in accordance with
the long established tradition of the
Organization.

$1,880,000 has been received from
subscriptions by 11,000 alumni con-
tributing toward the alumni quota of
$2,000,000 in the University’s new
program of development it was re-
ported yesterday. With only $120,-

all parts of the country expect to
bring the alumni campaign to a suc-
cessful conclusion within sixty days,
it is stated.

Chairmen in Dayton, Ohio and
Rochester, Minn., reported to offi-

sent to the Orient has reached Uni-
versity missionary alumni in China,
it is revealed in a letter from fifteen
teachers in Shanghai college which
was accompanied by a subscription
for $100. These alumni subscribed
to the fund, following a chop suey

DISCUSS MORAL

SITUATION HERE

Y. M. C. A. Plans Retreat To
Consider Problems

Calling together faculty members,
prominent students, and those partic-
ularly interested in the Y. M. C. A.
the first and second cabinet members
of the association are planning a
week-end retreat for the discussion
of pertinent student problems.

Temporary consideration has nam-
ed Hastings as the place for the gen-
eral get-together which has been
definitely scheduled for April 9 to 11,
coming at the end of the second
week of the Spring quarter.

A suggested program, which was!
outlined at the meeting, includes a j
talk and a group discussion on the
particular moral and religious situ-
ation at this University.

The moral problems such as hon- i
esty, politics, drinking, gambling, re-1
ligious matters and fellowship ques-
tions, all of which are to be found >
on the campus will be the specific
field for the conference.

An attempt will bo made to de-
termine the changes which will be

necessary to develop the

proper

spirit and attitude in regard to these
questions. Whether the Y. is cap-
able of doing it, how it can use its
various branches of machinery to ac-
complish it, particular programs and
personal qualifications of Y. leaders
will all be discussed during this time.

Laziness, Alias Asthenia, Displaces

Appendicitis as Fashionable Disease

Asthenia is now supplanting ap- children receive is another factor.
Unless corrected during childhood,

pendicitis and psychological com-
plexes as the most fashionable dis-
ease of the hour, according to Dr.
Max Seham, professor of pediatrics
at the University of Minnesota.
Asthenia, in plain words, is an in-
herited form of laziness.

Addressing the midwest confer-
ence of parent education last week,.
Dr. Seham said that an asthenic is
handicapped from birth psysically
and that he can never be expected to
do the same amount of work as a
normal person. The increasing pre-
valence of a chronically fatigued
condition among children is due to
a great extent to the complex inter-
est of modern child life and the aver-
age child’s complexity of interests.
The insufficient amount of rest manv

the resulting weariness will prevail
throughout the lifetime of the in-
dividual, with considerable detrim-
ental effect.

“Children, prone to imitate their
parents, learn quickly to stay up* late
at night with their parties and enter-
tainment,” Dr. Seham stated. “They
. tend in this way toward excessive
nervous and emotional habits, which
is threatening the stability and
health of future generations.”

According to the constitution of
the Undergraduate council as inter-
preted by Charles Anderson, presi-
dent of the council, it is impossible
for a vice-president of any class to
succeed to the office of presidency,
in event that office is vacated. Miss
Ellen McCracken, the present vice-
president of the Junior class, conse-
quently cannot succeed to the presi-
dency, although she has officiated in
that capacity since Weimer left
school during the early part of the
present quarter. Mass McCracken
will officiate at the elections today,
however.

E have in these times slid away from the ancient belief that vir-
tue is its own reward. We have come to feel that service is

not so common that it should be allowed to pass without some mark
of recognition. We experience, therefore, a mellow glow of satis-
faction when Oscar Blaughenhund, shopwalker in charge of Aisle
Three for thirty-nine years, is awarded the Siegel and Cooper medal
for meritorious service. The cockles of our hearts warm so per-
ceptibly when Paavo Popoff is given the “Allen A” silver cup for
proficiency in knitting Cooper union suits, that we do not mind the
fact that there isn’t enough cannel coal in the basement to keep even
a pale flame flickering on the house grate

But we also feel that there should be some bounds to all this.
When Officer Philius O'Reilly, for instance, who has patrolled his
beat (one heavily studded with wide open grog-shops) for his
twenty-fifth year and has had bestowed on him the $500 monthly
merit prize because of his remarkable service, we are prone to be-
lieve that there is something a bit superfluous about it. Plainly,
those concerned with the business of passing out “little tokens of
esteem for long and faithful service” err on the side of overliberality.

Yesterday we were exceedingly perturbed to see, in passing
about the campus, a surprising number of new sweaters with the maj-
or “C” emblazoned on them. True, the letter was crossed over by a
black “I,” but still the ”C” was there, life-size and natural color. We

mulled over this phenomenon,
that T stand for? Inocculated?

“Now, what,” we thought, “does
Inebriate?”—but we could think

of few things that seemed likely. At last we were told: Intramural. The program was of exactly the right
The sweaters had been givn to all the senior intramural managers, of I length.

whom, it appeared, there were as many as the sons of Solomon.
(This may not be the correct Scriptural reference, but still, it makes
the point clear.)

Somehow this time we did not feel the mellow glow we ex-
periencd on haring of the rewrad of Blaughenhund; the cockles
of our heart failed to respond as when we heard of the token of
esteem given Popoff. Intramural managers, we felt, were not as
these. Their work was not so heroic; it did not have the old world
witchery about it that one associates with shopwalking and union
suit knitting. It was, instead, an earthly, a gross, thing. It was,
therefore, to be rewarded as its character merited.

This feeling continues to grow on us. We feel it would be well
if the “C” were reserved for something other than intramural man-
agers. Not that we wish to disparage the intramural manager. We
feel that he is doing what is called “a great work.” Still, we must
hold to our stand on withholding the ‘‘C.” Undoubtedly, there is
a black “I” crossed over the letter, but then, a little work in the dark
hours with the scissors would uncross the “I.” No, no; we are firm
in the belief that intramural managers and “C’s” should have as little
as possible to do with each other. We throw out that suggestion, to
whomever has charge of the affair.

THE TIMOROUS AUTHORITIES

(From The Nation)

'PHE censorship of college publications continues at a monotonous
-L pace. From every section of the country come reports of
magazines or issues of magazines which some rather vague “Com-
mittee of the Faculty” has decided must never meet the tender
eyes of undergraduates. The editor of the Candle at Ohio State
university complains in his latest number that “Every publication
on the campus is censored from the harmless Ag Student” on down
to the “heretical” journal of opinion which he somehow keeps go-
ing. The story is an old one, and there is something to be said for
the theory that the danger of suppression increases a sophomore’s
zest in what he writes and chooses to publish. But the spectacle
is dreary at best, seeing that it fills so broad a stage and lasts so long.
An issue of the Occident at the university of California has been
killed because it contained a story of Joseph and Jesus which the
authorities” found blasphemous. The editor of the Illinois Magazine
at the university of Illinois has been deposed because he printed a
series of ‘‘Zinc City Sketches” dealing with the city of La Salle.
Certain citizens of the town did not like the sketches, visited the uni-
versity, and the editor went. The episode, we fear, is significant.
When the faculties of State universities become responsible to the
heads of zinc smelteries or to any other citizens, literature and educa-
tion are not safe. Public opinion, calling as it does here and there
for anti-evolution laws, is perhaps dangerous enough. Committees
of manufacturers are decidedly more so.

local hotel was pending, bought

in all the innocence of

hearing, and complete ignorance of the j
‘‘program’’ of the piece except as re- j
vealed in the three phrases printed under .
its title: he carried away chiefly impres-j
sions of a texture rich to the point of l
confusion, but rich in counterpoint rather 1
than in clash of harmonies; of more than
ordinary dramatic use of the trumpets, |
including dissonances high and exciting; I
of a rather monotonous noisiness; of a
tonal production that was incomplete in
itself—that was an illustration rather
than an independent form. It seemed
as if the hero’s “strife” must have con-
tinued into his “sensuous pleasures” and
his “divine activities,” except for the in-
tervention of a few bird-calls. A great
use of the brasses seemed necessary most
of the time, and except for one crisp
section for strings with a few wood-
winds, the composer practiced little eco-
nomy of orchestration. A valid criticism
of the composition would presuppose an
intimate knowledge of its program and
a settled opinion of the value of “pro-
gram music,” neither of which the writer
has.

The "Secret of Suzanne” overture
was a delightful hors d'oeuvre. The
Mozart performance was a refreshing
reading of a work that is hard to
stale: but one could have wished that
some of the dissonances in the first
movement had not been lost in the
subduing of the accompaniment fig-
ures. The "Voices of the Forest”
seemed simple diet after the “Divine
Poem,” and gave opportunity for beau-
tiful short solos in the woodwinds.

BY JACK WELTY

It is always hard to pick a real all-
star team from tournament play.
Stars may often play a mediocre brand
of basketball, while on the other hand,
men of lesser ability may rise to great
heights during the course of a few
games. The following selections
therefore are based only upon the play
of the men during the entire tourna-
ment and not during the semi-final
tilts alone.

Cassie at Center

Of the pivot men Cassie of the A.
T. O. five was undoubtedly the out-
standing star. Possessed of an un-
canny eye for the basket he led the
tourney in high scoring and was an all
around tower of strength to his team.
Hoey and Preiss were two good men
but lacked somewhat the stamp of a
finished player that Cassie seemed to
possess.

Kyle Anderson of the A. T. O.’s is
given one of the forward positions and
also the captaincy of the mythical all
star team. He was an excellent scor-
ing man, a wonderful dribbler and a
great leader. Koerber of Sigma Nu
is placed at the other forward. Al-
though not so flashy as Anderson he
was a valuable man and some of his
sensational shooting was the feature
of the tourney. Zolla and J. Ander-
son are placed upon the second team,

Murphy was undoubtedly one of the
outstanding men of the tourney. He
was a wonderful guard, rarely failed
to retrieve the rebound from the back-
board, could dribble with the best of
them and to top it oil he was a fair
shot at the basket. Gray was also a
stellar defensive man and would make
a good running mate for Murphy. His
dribbling was also very good and he
had one of the best shooting eyes on
the floor. O'Keefe and Reinwald were
also good guards while Dygert and
Olwin were not far behind. These
were chosen for the second and third
teams.

Such a team as this one would make
a wonderful aggregation. It would
have five stars, all of whom could
shoot and would be blessed with
plenty of speed. Anderson, Koerber
and Cassie would make a scoring trio
that would be hard to eclipse, while
plenty has already been said concern-
ing the ability of the guards.

WOMEN BEGIN SWIM
ACROSS L. MICHIGAN’ j

Soon students of the University will
be able to boast that some of their wo-
men have accomplished an almost im-
possible feat—that of swimming Lake
Michigan. For the gymnasium depart-
ment is conducting a marathon swim-
ming race which starts at Randolph
Streets and follows the curve of the
shore around to Michigan City. The dis-
tance that each contestant has gone is
marked by a pin on a chart of the lake.
Eighty-eight lengths of the tank counts
as one mile. The farthest advanced of

the swimmers has just reached
Street, and the three leaders are
sea, Sibbald and Ray.

The third interclass swimming

22nd

Chel-

will be held today at 4:30 in the Ida No-
yes tank. The results of this contest
will be averaged in with those of the
two previous ones to determine the
champions.

Three hundred athletes will draw
the attention of middle western track
fans to Patten gymnasium at North-
western university Friday amt Satur-
day, March 12 and 13, where they will
compete in the sixteenth annual Big
Pen track and field games.

Entries from every school in the
conference have been received and of-
ficials in charge anticipate one of the
closest contested meets in years.
Some of the finest athletes seen in the
conference for some time will compete
for first honors in the titular games.

Four schools are given almost equal
chances of topping the conference in
the forthcoming meet. Iowa, Illinois,
Michigan and Wisconsin with well-
balanced squads will make a deter-
mined effort to come out in front.
Each of these teams has a number of
able performers who are certain to win
points.

Iowa university, always one of the
leaders in the conference meet, will
bring one of the finest collections of
athletes ever assembled at the Hawk-
eye institution. With Cuhel in the
hurdles and 440, Dauber in the shot
put, Mann in the high jump, and Rob-
erts and Sorenson in the middle dis-
tance events, there is no reason why
the Hawks .shouldn’t prove formidable.

Werner in the hurdles and White
in the 880 will help keep Illinois in
the running. The Illini always bring
a skillful bunch of athletes to the in-
door meet and are certain to be up in
front. Other members of Coach Gill’s
cinder performers are Cickenson, two-
miler; Lyon in the shot put and Wal-
lace in the hurdles.

Chicago has Cusack in the 880 and
mile, Burge in the high jump and pole
vault, Beal in the 440, and Hobschied
in the shot put. Indiana will enter
Pepper in the dashes, Stephenson in
the 440 and Alexander in the two mile.

Purdue will base its hope on a fav-
orable showing in Little in the mile
and 880, Neff in the two-mile, Chance
in the high jump and Fox in the pole
vault. Ohio is certain to take home a
good portion of the points with Guth-
rie and Irwin in the hurdles and Ar-
nold in the mile.

LAFAYETTE, Ind., March 10.—
When the timer’s gun ended the Purdue-
Northwestern basketball game at Evans-
ton last week, assuring Purdue a tie for
the conference title, it also marked the
close of the career of George Spradling,
captain and one of Purdue’s greatest
forwards of all time and an outstand-
ing figure in middle western net circles
for the past three years. A review of
Spradling’s record for the three seasons
reveals he has scored 440 points for
Purdue in 43 games, or an average of
10.23 points per contest, and accounts
for his twice leading the Big Ten in
scoring and once placing up with the
leaders although missing three games of
the 1925 season. He is practically as-
sured of a berth on all the conference
fives being picked by sport writers.

Spradling’s greatest year was his first
in the Big Ten, when he led the Big Ten
snipers with 138 points and scored a total
during the season of 198. His second
year saw him handicapped by illness, but
he recovered in time to score 90 points
and helped put Purdue in the first divi-
sion. He has been a marked man since
the start of the present season, but de-
spite this fact he tallied 107 points, and

was a vital factor in bringing a cham-
pionship to Purdue.

Spradling’s grand field goal total is
172, or an average of four every time
he played with Purdue, a record which
will long stand as remarkable in the Big
Ten. His greatest scoring feat was re-
gistered Dec. 14, 1923, when he counted
eleven field goals and two free throws
for a total of 24 points against Earlham
college. Spradling has never been held
scoreless in 43 games, and only once has
been stopped without a field goal. Min-
nesota held the great star basketless last
season, just after Spradling rejoined his
teammates following his illness.

Spradling is a native of Frankfort.
Ind., and before coming to Purdue was
outstanding as a high scorer in Indiana
high school basketball circles. His gra-
duation next June will make him sorely
missed when Lambert opens his next

court season, and it
short of a super-star
of the marks he has

will take nothing
to dim the luster
achieved in three

years

at Purdue.

As will be noted, there are nine organ-
izations represented in today’s contests.
These organizations are anxious to win
because of the closeness to the finals,
and as a result every match will be hotly
contested. Most of the previous- con-
tests have been won by small margins,
so today’s play should be highly exciting.

Matches are to be held every day this
week so as to determine the winners
by Friday. Handball is the only winter
sport which has not been completed and
as a result all the attention of the de-
partment has been focused on the one
sport. The great popularity of handball
is the reason for this delay in complet-
ing its schedule along with other winter
sports. The greatest number of entries
in the history of the sport, flooded the
I-M department this year, and the pair-
ings have been run off as speedily as
possible.

Class basketball teams will close
the season with a tournament this
Friday at 3:30, in the main gymna-
sium of Ida Noyes hall, followed by a
basketball dinner at 5:30. The annual
honor game between the tourney win-
ner and the alumnae team will follow
the dinner.

1 ickets for the dinner may be ob-
tained for 50 cents from Adelaide
Ames, Hanara Lillybeck or captains
of the class basketball teams.

the Delta Sigs turned in the highest,
however, while Richard Taiss of the
same organization won second, and Ray
Hoey of the Sigma Nu’s took third.

Sigma Nu won more honors in the
Ice Carnival when the prowess of Claude
Brignall and George Percy piled up a
neat total of points. George Nardin, a
non-fraternity man, had third high point
honors. The Sigma Nu’s also cleaned
up on the relay ice races.

The wrestling championships were the
most hotly contested events on the pro-
gram and some real battles were fought.
The results were as follows: 117 pounds,
David Kreuger, Lambda Chi Alpha; 127
pounds, Erickson, Delta Tau Delta: 137
pounds, Sather, unattached; 147 pounds.
George O’Brien, Lambda Chi Alpha, 160
pounds, H. Wilson, Phi Kappa Sigma:
117, pounds, J. Baker; heavyweight,
Bury, Phi Pi Phi.

Thus the winter season ended with
the biggest participation on record and
was acclaimed by all as the most success-
ful one. The organizations and the men
who are listed above are requested to
meet on the rear steps of Bartlett gym
tomorrow at 10 in the morning, to have
their pictures taken for the annuals.

Suggestion for Gentlemen with
Black Eyes: Use Snider’s Ketchup

By Leo C. Rosenberg

“0! impotence of mind in body
strong”.

—Milt on.

Messrs. Snider and Heinz have not
as yet provided any serious competi-
tion to the surgeons of America,
but one of their common products
has been adapted for a quaintly med-
icinal use. As Antony remarked,
“lend an ear:”

“Speed” Raysson, second placer
in the 160 lb. wrestling class of the
University, returned from the sport
carnival last Thursday night with
his left optical organ shrouded in
black and dedicated to funeral cere-
monies—in other words he possessed
a “shiner.” Raysson, being a rather
cautious soul, desired to treat the
closed-for-the-night eye and asked
the expert advice of two of his erst-
while fraternity brothers at the Tau
Delta Phi house. These two diaboli-
cal imps resolved to emulate the atro-
cities of Peck’s Bad Boy at Brother

Raysson’s
looks they
“Speed” to
salt water

expense. With grave
advised the lamb-like
soak a pad of gauze in
and apply on the mid-

night colored optic. Raysson, like a
cherub being seduced into Hell, fol-
lowed the advice of these two Mach-
iavellian scoundrels and went
through the specified procedure. Just
as he was about to apply the salt-
watered pad one of the perpetrators
was smote by a terrific idea.

“Speed” he cried, vainly attempt-
ing to refrain from laughter, “I’ve
got just the thing for your black
eye!”

A smile broke forth on Raysson’?
Bull-Montana-like features. “What?”
he-queried, guileless as a babe.

“Ketchup!” was the jubilant re-
ply.

Our hero (Raysson) was stunned;
then a wave of indignation swept
over him.

“Hey!” he exclaimed angrily,
“Don’t horse me.”

“Speed!” the brother replied in a
hurt tone. “You don’t think I’d
kid you?”

“Speed” surrendered.

With a cry of victory the brother
rushed downstairs, grabbed a bottle
of Catsup—brand unknown—off .he
pantry shelf, applied a generous
amount of the preservative, and
dashed back upstairs.

In several minutes “Speed” his eye
bandaged by a huge piece of gauze
which reeked from an obnoxious hy-
brid odor of salt and Catsup, went
calmly to bed.

Just before he knew darkness he
called softly: “Lie.”

“Yep.”

“Gee, my eye feels better already.”
“Sure.”

“Feels as it’s drawing . . . Great
stuff, this Ketchup, eh?”

Allah be praised! What would
our pugilists do without* Drs. Snider
and Heinz?
