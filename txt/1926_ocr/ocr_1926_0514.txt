COUNCIL VOTES

CAN YOU BLAME HIM FOR WATCHING?

TWO PROPOSED
MODIFICATIONS

Other Recommendations Are
Deferred for 1927
Consideration

Fraternity rushing is still an un-
solved problem.

This fact was manifested last night
at a meeting of the Interfraternity
council when two modifications of
the present regulations were adopted.
The first suggestion ratified was that
a man cannot be pledged until his last
semester in high school; the second,
that on the first day of the quarter,
when all Spring and Summer pledges
become binding, each fraternity shall
distribute among the other Greek so-
cieties a list of its pledges.

Graeme Stewart, of Psi Upsilon;
Thomas Masters, of Delta Kappa
Epsilon, and Leland Neff, of Phi
Kappa Psi, composed the committee
that investigated rushing conditions.
They proposed the two rulings that
were adopted, and made several sug-
gestions, which may demand a re-
codification of the council’s rushing
regulations.

Problem* Too Vital

“Some of the more radical regula-
tions that we felt were needed are too
vital to be settled in the remaining
few months of this council’s exist-
ence,” explained Leland Neff. “We
have laid them before the council in
the form of suggestions, to be acted
upon after thorough consideration by
the 1927 Interfratemity council.”

Among the recommendations made
by different members of the commit-
tee and council at large are several
“deferred rushing systems,” such as
a regulation against pledging before

FRESHMAN WOMEN’S
SOCIETY ENTERTAINS

CLASSMATES AT TEA

Freshman Women’s club will be
hostess to all women of the fresh-
man class and their upperclass coun-
sellors at a bridge party and tea,
next Friday, from 3:30 to 5:30 in
Ida Noyes hall. Bridge will be played
in the theatre, and tea served later
in the sun parlor.

All freshman women have been
asked to bring their counsellors with
them. In case this is impossible, each
freshman is to bring some other up-
perclass woman.

“We cordially invite all women of
the freshman class to attend the
party," said Ruth Norman, president
of the club. Every effort has been
made to assure them a pleasant
afternoon as this is the first all-class
affair sponsored by the club this
quarter.”

Sophomores Donate Fifty Dollars

To Women’s Interscholastic Rushing

Fifty dollars has been contributed
by the Sophomore class to the Wom-
en’s rushing committee of the World’s
Greatest Interscholastic. This gift
will make it possible for the women
who are entertaining the track stars
to serve refreshments after the Sen-
ior Vaudeville on the night of June
4 and after the Moonlight dance in
Hutchinson court, June 5. Sign of
the Sickle, the honor society for soph-
omore women, will undertake the re-
apnnsihiHty of serving the food on
both nights.

Don McGinnis (left twill Nov the part of Prudence Chapel, a gay young campus woman, and Clyde Keutzer (right)
will enact the rob of Louise, the heroine of Wallie’s heart, in the tucuty-secomi ann; ^ production of the Rlackfriars,
entitled, "IVaUie Watch-Out" to be staged in Mandel hall tonight, with Performances scheduled for this evening, tomorrow
| afternoon and night, and three appearances next week-end.

GIFFORD HITZ

MANAGES SING

Boynton Named Assistant
By James Cusack

Gifford Hitz will be the Under-
graduate leader of the Interfrater-
nity sing when the thirty-two Greek
letter societies meet in competition
on June 12. Hitz was appointed by
James Cusack, president of the In-
terfraternity council, at the last
meeting of that body. Holmes Boyn-
ton will be his assistant.

Since the alumni always play a
very important part in the annual
function, an alumni chairman will
soon be appointed by Cusack.

The loving cup that is each year
presented to the winner went to the
Phi Delta Theta house last year
when the group arrived with 113
contestants. Phi Kappa Psi was sec-
ond and Phi Gamma Delta third.

Preparations will be started at once
for the annual affair. The stimula-
tion of the alumni is always the big
job of the chairman, for it is quan-
tity, not quality, that appeals to the
undergraduate sing audience.

Informal clothing is always worn
at this annual affair and each frater-
nity sings two fraternity songs, one
as they march into Hutchison court
and the other as they stand around
the fountain.

Although this is the twenty-second
Interscholastic track meet held at the
University, it is only the second time
that the women have assisted in
rushing the men. “These concrete
evidences of co-operation more than
convince me of the enthusiasm with
which both men and women are en-
tering into the spirit of the event
and I see no reason why we can’t
make this year’s meet a great suc-
cess,” said Catherine Fitzgerald,
hairman of the Women’s commit-
tee. i

Doctor BratHsh
Turns Surveyor
as Classic Ends

• “Yessir!” says Doc Bratfish, “on
this same day, when the sun is high
in the heavens, and the chimes call
the hour of twelve. I shall hie me
over to the senior bench, and with my
micrometer, centimeter, chronometer,
and other sundry instruments of (he
expert, and there while admiring
thousands stand gasping or breathless
or something, I shall determine the
nearest thing to a man in this here
University. If any.”

What the Doctor means is that the
mustache race ends at noon today.
Ami the competition is keen. In fact
it is bristling. Paul Cullom, sifting
Campbell’s tomato soup through his
own massive whisker over at the Phi
Psi house, had no official statement to
make. “Lovely” Lee Neff peers out
from behind his crop and looks con-
fident.

VODVIL TRYOUTS
START TUESDAY

Present Skits in Outline
For Senior Show

Tryouts for the Senior Vaudeville
to be given June14 for the Interschol-
astic men will be held next Tuesday,
•in Mandel hall at 4 o’clock. This is the
first preliminary tryout and there will
be another next Thursday in Mandel
at the same time.

Ail people trying out must bring a
synopsis of their act in order that the
judges may get an idea of the nature
of each sketch presented. While it is
not necessary for the acts to be finish-
ed when given at the tryouts, they
must be partially formulated.

It is necessary, for all those who
wish to take part in the Vaudeville,
to try out either next Tuesday or
Thursday because active work on the
show must start at once in order to
get the acts in shape for the early
date, according to Handschy.

“Every one in the University is
eligible to try out for the Vaude-
ville. It is not limited to Seniors.
Blackfriar men are especially invited
to try out because the Vaudeville skits
will not be hard to handle. Every one
interested ought to be able to take
part, as all acts will be short and
simple.” said Miss Liggett.

Fred Handschy and Helen Liggett
are the co-chairmen of this year's an-
nual Senior frolic. Handschy has had
experience in University theatrical
work and Miss Liggett has been active
in Mirror productions. Besides taking
part in several Mirror plays. Miss Lig-
gett was president of the club this
year.

the new editorial staff for 1926-7 are
Fred Handschy, Addison Wilson. John
Barton. James Root, William Steven
son, and Robert Markley.

BLACKFRIARS PLAY FOR
CAPACITY HOUSE; WILL
BROADCAST PRODUCTION

In Which Terrible Turk
Tells the Charm

Of It All

By Leo Stone

It’s a good old institution, this
Blackfriars business of ours.

Last night, sitting in the shadows
of Mandel hall as the boys went
through their final workout, I was
increasingly impressed with the
charm of it all. As one views the per-
formance it is not with the critical
eye of one who demands the syn-
chronized gestures of the Scandals,
nor the scandalous gyrations of the
dear old State and Congressors. It
is rather a comfortable feeling, an
intimate attitude, which comes as
you watch the guy who sits in front
of you in Poly Sci prance across the
stage with a ravishing smile and ter-
ribly bowed legs. The boys in “Wal-
lie Watch-Out” are as accurately,
and as ridiculously, feminine as ever.
The show has its raw spots, but as
ever, too, plenty of them are in the
jokes.	»

Clyde Keutzer makes a pretty girl.
If he wore those clothes on campus
he could make plenty pretty men,
too. And Don McGinnis—ha, ha, etc.
McGinnis is unparalleled in his in-
terpretation of the kind of a girl!
who flourishes in the dread kingdom
of Blind Dates. Sew Covert is what
you would expect him to be. When
he sets his verbal claws on the guile-
less freshman, Marvin Hintz, it’s
enough to stir the granite conscience
of any fraternity man-hunter.

The music has tunes, and the spe-
cialty acts—well, let them try to es-
cape the relentless entertainment
chairmen of future class dinners and
marshmallow club girl roasts.

W. A. A. PRESIDES
AT FIFTH BOOTH IN

QUADRANGLE FETE

“Our Chicago,” the song written
by Norman Reed, which was awarded
first prize in the W. A. A. song con-
test will be sold in the W. A. A. booth
at the Quadrangle Fete tonight and
tomorrow. The song has not been
included in the score of Blackfriar
songs, but will be sold in single copies
for fifteen cents.

Virginia Gartside will be in charge.
The saleswomen at this booth will be
dressed in formal costume at evening
performances and in light summer
dresses at afternoon performances.

This booth, though a part of the
Quadrangle fete, will not be decor-
ated, according to the scheme of dec-
oration of the booths under the di-
retion of the Y. W. C. A. but will
display copies of the new campus
song.

MANAGING EDITOR
OF DAILY MAROON

ATTENDS CONFAB

Milton Kauffman, managing editor
of The Daily Maroon, left this morning
for the sixth annual conference of Big
Ten editors at the University of Iowa,
Iowa City, Iowa.

At this convention the newspaper
men in the Conference will discuss the
different news systems and their com-
parative values. Last year the •Con-
ference was held at Purdue university,
Lafayette, Indiana. Last year Ken-
neth Laird and Herbert DeYoung, rep-
resentatives to the conference, attended
the meetings.

Keutzer, Covert, Hintz,
and McGinnis Star
in 1926 Show

With the traditional first night
audience of Old Grads and Under-
grads who have won in the scramble
for seats, “Wallie Watch-Out,” the
annual Blackfriars production, will
open in Mandel hall at 8:30 tonight.

For the past week, the opening
night has been sold out. Seats for
Saturday night are at a premium.
And seats for Friday and Saturday
nights of next week are going rap-
idly. It is probable that both Satur-
day matinees will play to capacity
houses.

Broadcast Show

The entire production will be put
on the air. Station WMAQ will
broadcast the first act and WLS the
second.

Clyde Keutzer and Don McGinnis,
who won fame last year in “Kaiti
From Haiti,” will play the female
leads in “Wallie.” Seward Covert,
head cheerleader of the University,
and a Superior of the Order of Black-
friars, another star'-of last year, will
play the male lead. Marvin Hintz,
a newcomer to University dramatics,
will take the title role of Wallie, the
typical college boy.

Best in History

Blackfriars of previous years who
have seen the rehearsals proclaim the
script the best in history and the
music of exceptional excellence. The
scenery, too, is attracting consider-
able attention, as it has been built at
great expense and effort.

The “Rhapsody in Blue,” ballet,
it is believed, will be one of the big-
gest hits of the show. Costuming for
this specialty is pronounced superb.

Glee Club Appear*'

For the first time, the University
Glee club will appear in a Blackfriar
show. Specialty numbers on a scale
never before attempted will also be
among the attractions.

Under the direction of Hamilton
Coleman, the cast and choruses have
been practicing for the past three
weeks, while the dance acts have been
in charge of Archie Scott, a profes-
sional dancer who staged the Hares-
foot club dance number this year.

“Wallie Watch-Out” was written
by Walker Davis and William Bager,
two students.

DUAL CLASS MIXER
STAGED BY JUNIORS
AND SENIORS TODAY

Two orchestras, continuous dancing,
and an innovation in management—
such are the attractions offered at the
Junior-Senior mixer this afternoon in
the Reynolds club between the hours
of 4 and 6

Bill Hahn’s College Crew of great
campus renown, with a membership
of seven “hot” musicians will occupy
one end of the dancing floor, while
Ken Ward and his helpers will reign
supreme at the other end. Not once
during the two hours will there be a
breathing interval for the charles-
toners.

For the first time in the history of
the University, at least as far back
in history as anyone remembers, the-
Junior and Senior classes are sponsor-
ing an all-University mixer together..
The purpose, if there is one, as ex-
plained by John Howe, Junior class
president, is to promulgate, friendship
between the two classes.

MU ALPHA OF NORTHWEST-
ERN ANNOUNCES THE PLEDG-
ING OF THE WHISTLE CLUB OF
THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.
Members of the Whistle club will
wear the official pledge button, a Bull
Durham tag, in their coat lapels or
dresses directly over their heart. This
will be worn for a period of one week
while the official Mu Alpha pins are
being manufactured. Members are
requested to see Mimi or me for fur-
ther inside dope, and the price on the
pin.

TO SIS

I do not know just what you think, —
Or how you act on dates.

You seem to be quite genial
Sans jealousies or hates.

Yet, I should straightway warn my
friends

To keep out of your sight
If I were sure you carried on

Exactly as you write!

—GeaG.

HAROLD ENRIGHT, Mu Alpha
chief, showed the Whistle committee,
Chuck Novak, Ted Lockhard, and
This, their contribution box. It con-
tained for one day’s offerings over a
hundred contribs. The editor of the
Whistle was led away in hysterics.

Mu Aipha has over five hundred
members paying regular dues. Most
of those we met were deeply inter-
ested in the Chicago branch, and ex-
pressed their hope that as many of
us as possible would come up to the
dance tonight at the Edgewater
Beach.

Because its lather rather tends

How The Other Half Lives

Sir:

Once a Woman opened a checking
account at a bank. She was very
prpud of her new check book, and
everywhere she went she gave out
checks. One day she lost the book.
She went to the bank for a new one.
“I lost my other one,” she said, “but
it’s all right, nobody else could use
them; they were all signed.”

—Elli. K.

WE lunched at Du Braueills’ in
Evanston. The place was filled with
pretty girls, sorority girls, and girls.
They told us that Northwestern has
five, or was it three, girls to every
man. That might be some explana-
tion for the many familiar faces for-
merly at Chicago which we identi-
fied on the north side campus.

WOMEN

Women are like street cars. Any
man, with a little practice, can learn
to control them perfectly; but they
are all alike and the average intel-
ligent man finds it more convenient
to take one that is going his way.

—Stevie.

MEN

Men are like second hand chairs.
They aren’t very valuable or good to
look at. They are of no use unless
they’re sat upon.

—Sis.

THE Mu Alpha pin is a Bull’s head
with an M making eyebrows over the
two pearl eyes, and an A forming
the mouth. A gold chain is attached
to a guard in the shape of a Shovel
upon which will be engraved—
“Whistle.”

A POEM OF POEMS
Take Two fresh Eggs,
Crack them,
And Mix well in a Shaker—
Add a Bit of Grenadine syrup,
And the Juice of Pineapple
Or Oranges^
Uncork the Bottle and Pour carefully
Two or Three fingers—
Shake vigorously,
And place on Ice for one Hour.
If you don’t know what nevt,
It’s your own damn Fault!

WE will be known, as the Univer-
sity gives us official permission, as
Whistle of Mu Alpha. Membership
will be strictly on election,

—TERRIBLE TURK,

Aesthete Sees
Charleston As

Artistic Sprout

“Time may make the Charleston
beautiful.”

This is the opinion of a scholar and
student’of the arts, perspectively view-
ing, and seeking to analyze the great
wave of popularity of a new dance
which recently swept ever the coun-
try, manifesting itself on stage and in
ballroom.

“The CharlestoA"| Miss Louisa
Lewis Clark writes in a thesis on
“The Dance in Relation to the Other
Arts,” submitted to the University
for the degree of master of
arts, “is one of the vigorous sprouts
in our artistic life from the main
source, artistic originality in this
country.

“Its popularity," she writes further,
“shows us that we have and appreciate
native vigor and originality at least.
However, our concern here is whether
dancing is taught in the schools leads
to an intelligent evaluation of such
eruptions as the Charleston. [

“We see, then, the strength of our
general dancing, in its rather tmeon-
scious, objective character, and further
the sound philosophy back of it. We
see, too, its weakness in the fact that
it seldom functions in the experience
of those who study it.”

After a detailed and thorough re-
view of the origin, development and
history of dancing the writer con-
cludes, “We are coming around again
to a hint of a further revival of an-
cient art in answer to modern needs;
a development again of the fertile
medium in which all the arts origin-
ally germinated.”

The winner of the Fiske Poetry

Prof. Lovett, “all of which were of
a high quality.”

The other judges, as announced by
Prof. Lovett, are Miss Marianne
Moore, editor of the Dial, and Llwel-
lyn Jones, literary editor of the Chi-
cago Evening Post.

Lieutenant C. R. Gildart, instruc-
tor in the physical culture classes of
the Military Science department, has
joined the ranks of the “Tumblers”
club. The lieutenant was admitted
into the organization after being
thrown from one of the more spirited
“nags” his youthful proteges canter
around on.

As an alibi for his misfortune, the
lieutenant says, “I was conducting an
individual research in dismounting
methods.” Evidently a good horse-
man must know how to fall grace-
fully. To honor the entrance of the
lieutenant into the ranks of the club
he was given the office of faculty ad-
viser.

But the membership of the club
does not end with the faculty adviser.
Mr. Sherman, one of the “buck priv-
ates,” thought it would be nice to be
president and he cinched the job by
taking the first fall. Other members
are, Hagens, Renhault, Berkenfield,
Fitzpatrick, Bassie and Moy. And
with jumping hurdles and sand bags
the list will probably increase rap-
idly.

A kitchen utensil shower will be
part of the W. A. A. bridge today
from 3:30 to 5:30 in the gymnasium
on the second floor of Ida Noyes hall.
Progressive bridge, and refreshments
will constitute the program, accord-
ing to Frances Lawton, president of
the association. Members of W. A.
A. have been urged to consult the
bulletin board in the foyer of Ida
Noyes hall and contribute articles
that are posted.

i Several contributions from the
alumnae have been already received.
It is hoped that the committees on
furnishing will finish their prepara-
tions soon, so that the house-warm-
ing which has been planned may be
held.

a man enters the University, and
than a week of rushing without any
pledging.

Start Alternate Week*

Another theory was a week of
rushing and then a week without
rushing, followed by a week of pledg-

ing. All these were offered with the
hope of giving the right man to the
right group, and giving each sufficient
opportunity to reach a decision.

“We hope that next year will see
the solution to the problem of rush-
ing,” said James Cusack, president of
the 1927 council. “If nothing else is
accomplished, it will justify the coun-
cil’s existence to make a satisfactory
settlement of this problem.”

COURTESY"

. ALWAYS

The Gass I railroads, constituting the bulk of rail-
way mileage of the United States, represent a proper-
ty investment on their own books of approximately
$23,900,000,000, or slightly more than $200 for every
man, women and child in the country. They are tenta-
tively valued for rate-making purposes by the Inter-
state Commerce Commission at approximately $20,-
5 00,000,000, but this estimate is subject to revision.
The par value of the capitalization—stocks and bonds
—outstanding against this investment is approximately
$ 18,800,000,000.

Title to these properties is vested in corporations
consisting of approximately one million stockhold-
ers, and the properties are mortgaged to about an
equal number of bondholders. The number of direct
holders of railway securities therefore is roughly
equal to the number of railway employes. Owing
to the fact that raising new capital by the sale of
stock has been difficult in recent years, approxi-
mately 60 per cent of the total capitalization at pres-
ent consists of bonds.

The stockholder is a partner in the business, with
all the rights and risks inherent in ownership. Through
the board of directors he selects the executives and
directs the management of his property, but he also is
the first to suffer if for any reason earnings become
inadequate. All the costs of operation, including
wages, all the taxes, all the rents, all the interest due
the bondholders must be paid out of the railway re-
ceipts before the stockholder can participate—if any-
thing is left—by taking dividends and setting aside
something for reinvestment in the property.

Although there are probably "not more than two
million direct holders of railway securities, many
additional millions of our population have an indirect
and often unrecognzed ownership interest in the
railroads. More than 5 0,000,000 policyholders in life in-
surance companies and more than 39,000,000 depositors
in savings banks have such an interest in the rail-
roads through the investment these institutions have
made in railway securities. Many millions of dol-
lars in the endowment funds of our leading colleges
and universities are also invested in railway securities.

A development in recent years encouraging to those
who seek the improvement of the public and em-
ploye relationships of our railroads is that of increased
direct customer and employe ownership of railway
stocks and bonds. “Main Street” is thus taking the
place in railway circles once ascribed to “Wall Street,”
and the result is public ownership of our railroads in
its truest and most widely beneficial sense.

Monday

Maroon net hopefuls depart tonight
for Columbus where they will meet
the powerful Buckeye squad before re-
turning home to play hosts to the Wol-
verines next Monday afternoon. The
Ohio State bunch at present lead the
Conference in conjunction with the 11-
lini, neither team having dropped a
match as yet.

The locals are far down on the per-
centage list at present, having only
won one of three attempts. Captain
Schaeffer and Hudlin arc going at top
form and should bring in wins over
their opponents. Both squads are
strong in the singles matches and
weak in the doubles end of it, making
for an interesting meet.

Beat Purdue. 4-2

In the Buck meet with the Boiler-
makers, which squad by the way, won
from the Maroons, they won every sin-
gles fray and lost both doubles match-
es. This left the meet at 4-2 in favor
of the Buckeyes. Coach Wirthwein
has a strong bunch of players and a
well coached one. "Bud" Tracy,
Harold Bullen and Captain Seymour
arc the outstanding men or* the squad.
Bradley and Bohmer make the other
two men on the Buck varsity.

The Columbus gang showed what
they were made of when they took
all nine matches in their meet with
Indiana last Saturday. All their sin-
gles matches except one wen- over in
but two sets this meet, and most of
these were won by almost love scores.

Shapinsky Playing Well

Shaptnsky, sopohomer star, has been
going along very well, considering his
lack of experience, and will go as
third man on the team. Drain, Hall
and Bennett make up the rest of the
local squad.

.After the Columbus meet, the team
will return to Chicago and prepare
for the Wolverine invasion. Three of
the Michigan five who will come here
are veterans, having won their letters
in former years. These men are Cap-
tain Kirkham, Crane and Vose. 01ian
was a member of last year’s team.
Stevens is the only new man on the
present varsity.

This lineup presents a formidable
front and will be a hard nut for the
Maroons to crack. Two tough meets
in a row are in order for the locals
and they’ll have to work hard to win
both of them.

“Bring On More Rain”—Says Coach
Mac Gillivray as Men Crowd Tank

By “Gen” Florez

There are times when nature as-
serts her authority rain follows—
tennis practice ceases, golf fiends sad-
ly pack their rusty weapons in a wet
bag. net practice on slippery courts
is impossible, horses stumble in the
mud of Greenwood Field—all outdoor
sports, including the hardy basebailers
are forced to make a hurried retreat
to the dressing rooms.

Old Men Back

What to do! What to do? they ask
MacGillivray, might as well get soak-
ed right and take a dip! And so’ it
goes. Men who had neglected their
silk tank suits for white flannels
and tennis shoes, return humbly to the
domain of the swim coach.

Postpone Yesterday’s
Intra-Mural Contests

Because of the heavy and un-
expected downpour of rain all of
yesterday afternoon’s playground
ball games had to be called off.
The postponed games will not,
however, interfere with the regu-
lar schedule for they will be sand-
wiched in between next week’s
games in some way. Those teams
who were to have played will be
notified by the intermural depart-
ment as to the playing time. The

TRACK TOURNEY

Editor of Big Ten Weekly
Runs Telegraph Meet

A new idea in Big Ten athletic
circles has been introduced by the
Big Ten Weekly, edited by Albon
Holden. It is in the form of a tele-
graphic track meet for the Confer-
ence frosh squads, to take place on
May 20, 21, and 22.

Adds Incentive

There has been a long felt need
for such an affair, for, it brings into
competition the yearling runners,
otherwise barred from intercollegiate
competition and gives them an added
incentive to apply themselves to the
first year training. There have been
several dual meets held in this way
and have proved very successful, but
this is the first time that a large
scale affair has been attempted.

May Not Enter

According to Lonnie Stagg, it is
uncertain whether the Maroon Frosh
will be entered in the meet, due to
lack of a suitable place to practice
and hold the races, caused by the
building of the new stadium. He is
sure that his team would have a very
good chance to cop first honors, it
being one of the best in the Confer-
ence. All other Big Ten schools have
entered the meet except the Univer-
sity of Michigan, who is holding an
interscholastic meet on the days of
the Frosh meet, and have a similar
handicap to that of the locals.

This meet is an unique idea for
such an affair as it does not involve
any loss of time due to travel.

Thursdays—the infiu of old men glad-
ened the coach, instilled new pep into
new players—more water splashed on
the sidings.

What’s all this about? Just trying
to tell you how news of a neglected
world finally arrived at the sport desk.
For the first time since spring weath-
er with its tulips, moonlight nites—and
lack of stories. Moon Stephenson and
Harry Shlaes were glad to receive
news from a winter sport department.

Well, to go on—MacGillivray has
been planning to insure his chances
of capturing the Water Polo cham-
pionship of next winter, and with the
help of a few enthusiasts some sort of
scrimmage has been devised—taking
place on the two days mentioned. Al-
most all the veterans are back with
sxefption of Captain Pctrobwitz, who
will exchange his {polo suit for a

SEND OUT ENTRY
BLANKS FOR I-M

SPRING CARNIVAL

Will Decide as to Whether
Stagg Field Will

Be Used

Another step in arranging for the
Second Annual Spring Festival, the
big climax to Intramural Sports for
the year, was taken yesterday when en-
try blanks were sent out to all or-
ganizations, inviting them to compete.
The meet takes place May 27th and
28th.

Announce Rules

Eligibility rules for the carnival were
also announced yesterday. All fresh-
men and varsity candidates for base-
ball, tennis,, golf, and track are barred.
Any man who has won points in an
intercollegiate track contest is not
eligible for this meet. All green shirts
and numeral men of this year’s Frosh
Track squad are in-eligible, as are all
full numeral trackmen of this year
and the one preceding. In spite of
these very inclusive rules, a very large
number of entries is anticipated.

It is not known yet whether the
meet may be held on Stagg Field, but
it is hoped. According to Weddell, man-
ager of the Carnival, it will be known
next week, when the construction of
the new stadium will have progressed
enough to tell whether the old track
can be used. If the intensive building j
program makes it impossible to em-
ploy Stagg Field, the Festival will he
held at the Y. M. C, A. track.

Card Eleven Events

Eleven events are included on the
blanks mailed out yesterday. They arc
as follows: 50 yd. dash, 100 yd. dash,
220 yd. dash. 440 yd. run, 880 yd. run,
mile run, 120 yd. low hurdles. 12 lb.
shot, broad jump, running high jump,
half-mile relay.

Each contestant is limited to two
events, and an organization must com-
pete in at least seven events to obtain
extra points. Both of these rules are
aimed to get as many men out for
the spring classic as is possible.

Five Winning Places

In order to offer a wide field, every
event is to include five winning places,
points to count five, four, three, two
and one. Medals are to be awarded
for all five places, first getting gold,
second silver, and third, fourth and
fifth bronze.

Outstanding organizations for first
honors are Kappa Sigma. Delta Sigma
Phi, Phi Kappa Psi, and Alpha Tau
Omega, Scherabul, expert dash man
on the Kappa Sig outfit, and Farris,
stellar distance pacer of the Delta Sigs
are favorites for individual honors.

Cap and Gown quite soon. Jerry
Greenberg, Lane, White, Krogh, Gor-
don, Jelinek and a few others have
been up to their old tricks, lead by
the expert advice of the Coach and
Captain-elect Parker Hall.

Drill New Men

What’s more a few promising no-
vices at the art of handling the water
soaked pill are slowly being put in
shape to stand the gaff of varsity play
next season. Bob Feris, who has been
appointed "guardian of the scoring
gate” has in a few weeks’ time, de-
veloped into a player of true worth.
Mighty few goals have slipped past
Bob in the last practices; yes. it seems
as if grounds for worry about rein-
forcement are false. “Plenty of time
left, and plenty of chances,” says Mac,
“come on out and try your luck, swim-
mers.”

Four Conference

Games Tomorrow

Coach Norgren and his ball
nine will take another week-end
rest over Saturday, thereby leav-
ing the percentage column of the
Big Ten standing untouched for
other teams to disturb.

Minnesota plays a return game
at Wisconsin tomorrow afternoon
in the second Badger-Gopher en-
counter of the present week. The
Badgers won the first battle and
are favored to repeat tomorrow.
They have won four and lost two
games.

Michigan, at present leading
the Conference race with five
won and one lost, plays Illinois
at Champaign, and is favored to
cop.

The remaining games on Satur-
day’s bill are between the Purple
and Boilermakers at Evanston,
and the Hoosiers and Buckeyes
at Bloomington.

WEDDELL MAKES

CHEERING PLANS

Hope to Have All Rooters
In One Section

Bill Weddell, newly elected head
cheer leader, and his assistant, John-
ny Gerhardt are already making plans
for carrying out their duties next fall.

In order to get good results and a
maximum volume in the yelling it is
necessary to have the rooters concen-
trated in one part of the stands, and
it is along this line that the new yell
masters are directing their early ef-
forts. In former years the spread-out
grouping of the student spectators has
seriously handicapped the cooperative
yelling, and in the building of the new
stadium Weddell and Gerhardt see a
chance for remedying the situation.

AH Students Together

The way it is planned now, the stu-
dent section will occupy several rows
along the entire West Stands. Wed-
dell hopes to change this plan by con-
centrating the entire student section
in the center of this stand. Such a
plan would greatly add to the effective-
ness of the rooting, and would afford
the new leaders a decided improve-
ment over the conditions of former
years.

In addition to this, the noted im-
provement in the Chicago Band will
play a great part in the yelling of
next year. According to Weddell, ev-
ery effort is being made to secure
the best of cooperation between the
band and the rooters. Especially will
that be true in the singing.

In order to get started on the work
immediately, Weddell is planning a
meeting for next Wednesday. "This
meeting is for the purpose of getting
a line on the outstanding candidates
for this fall," said Weddell, "and also
to make initial plans for the cheer-
leading in the new stadium. The new
North Stand with its capacity of 17,-
000 should produce three times as
much vocal support as the old West
Stand, and we are out of it.”

AWARD TROPHY TO
BEST GRID PLAYER

Evanston. Ill.. May 12.—The coveted
grid award, a silver figure of a foot-
ball player on a base, which is to be
given to the man showing the greatest
improvement during the spring foot-
ball practice, will be awarded between
the halves of the Maroon and Purple
game to be held on Saturday afternoon
it was announced Tuesday. The win-
ner will not be announced until that
time. „

Northwestern grid players have been
practicing all Spring and this award,
awarded annually, is looked toward
by at least three or four men.

LEAVE TONIGHT AT TEN O’CLOCK

FOR OHIO STATE; BURG EXPECTED
TO COP HIGH JUMP FOR MAROONS

Captain Cusack, McKinney Are Strong Points in Local
Attack; Chances Are Slim for Copping
the Meet

By Bob Stern

What the Maroon track team and
its loyal adherents look forward to in
the Outdoor Conference, will may, in
a way, be accurately forecasted tomor-
row, when the third annual quadran-
gler meet between Wisconsin, 'Ohio
State, Northwestern, and Chicago will
be held. The affair is to be held at
Columbus on the Ohio State Field and
it appears that it will be the meet
that will hold the greatest general in-
terest for conference sponsors over the
week-end.

Chances Not Good

Chicago’s chances in the meet are
not rated very high; in fact the ex-
pectation is that the Maroon team will
probably he on the small end of the
score sheet when the totals are given
out. Nevertheless Coach Stagg is
sending the strongest team that could
be recruited from his squad and they
will certainly show well in some of
the individual events. Not much is
expected from the team as a whole for
one very sufficient reason—the fact
that the home team has been so ter-
rifically handicapped by the lack of
a track to condition on.

Wisconsin is granted a big edge on
first nlace in the meet. The Badger
outfit has already won the controversy
three times and they are out this year
to make it four in a row. With such
men as McGinnis in the hurdles, Ken-
nedy in the middle distances, and
Schracder in the weights they have all
the material in the world with which
to gain the highly necessary firsts. The
Wisconsin team has been a whirlwind
winner this year. In the last meet they
absolutely swamped Minnesota by the
score of 84 to 50.

Burg to Win Jump

Chicago's hopes rest with three men,
Burg. Capt. Cusack, and McKinney.
Burg is doped to win the high jump,
but only after a battle with McGin-
nis and Anson of Ohio. He also may
take places in the pole vault and the
broad jump. McKinney's all around
work is expected to bring in the most
Maroon markers. However he is go-
ing to have tough sledding in the
hurdles when he meets the formidable

SPRING I-M SPORTS
RAPIDLY COMING TO
SUCCESSFUL CLOSE

The intramural handball singles
tournament is gradually nearing its
close with the semifinal round already
reached. Most of the players who
reached the semifinal round in the
doubles tournament have shown
great skill in the singles. In the
semifinals are Christianson, Phi
Kappa Sigma; Goodman and Silver-
man, doubles title-holders; Watkow-
ski, Elson, Henrickson, and Geisman.

Tennis also is rapidly nearing the
semifinal round with the third round
rapidly being played off. The golf
tournament is attracting some strong
entries, among whom are McKinley,
former Englewood star. With play-
ground ball almost near the semifin-
als, everything is in readiness to have
the winner determined in time for
the June carnival when the prizes
and medals will be awarded to the
lucky contestants.

In former years the only Spring
intramural sport of any importance
at all was the playground ball tour-
ney, but this year many others are
holding places in the interest of the
students.

Guthrie of Ohio and the ever per-
nicious McGinnis. Guthrie in his last
few starts has smashed every known
conference hurdles record and if Mc-
Kinney even runs him a close race
his reputation as a barrier topper will
be made.

Capt. Jimmy Cusack and Martin of
Wisconsin are scheduled to be the star
performers in the feature race of the
day—the half mile. Martin has twice
beaten Jimmy, and this time he is all
set to beat him or break in the at-
tempt But in the Illinois relays Mar-
tin won the event in 1:55, in the Kan-
sas relays he made under 1 :55, and he
is conceded to be the best half miler
in the conference. All of which is go-
ing to make it exceedingly difficult
for the Maroon Captain to v in out.

Leave Tonight

The rest of the personnel of the
Chicago team consist of Mickelberry,
to run in the dashes, Hitz. Dugan and
Hegovich to compete in the distance
runs, Hobscheid, Rouse, Schabinger,
and Olwin to throw the weights, and
Morrison to run with McKinney in the
hurdles. These men will leave at
10:00 (Chicago time) tonight from the
Pennsylvania station.

Ohio undoubtedly will score heav-
ily in the huddles and dash events.
Guthrie of course will be the point
man in the hurdles, while Irwin and
Grimm are the Buckeye dash stars.
Ansin in the high jump and Gabalac
in the hammer are their best field men.

Purple Weak

Northwestern has a few possible
point getters in addition to Martin. Al-
though Martin in the 440 and 880
is the main-stay of the Furpie, there
are several good men in the weights
at the Evanston school. Bagge, Green-
I burg, and Nessler are all good men
I at the shot. Also there are Furrey
in the mile, Retting in the high jump
and White in the pole vault to be tak-
en into consideration.

SCHEDULE WOMEN’S
SWIMMING TOURNEY

FRIDAY AFTERNOON

With events for both novices and
advanced swimmers. W. A. A. will
sponsor an all-University open swim-
ming meet next Friday. The events

and diving. The open events are
twenty yard free style, twenty back-
stroke. twenty breast, and forty free
style. For diving the requirements

Noyes swimming pool promptly, ac-
cording to Adele Whiteld, swimming
representative of W. A. A. A record
breaking entry list is expected for
this meet, because it is open to ail
women of the University, and because
this sport is last gaining popularity tn
feminine athletic circles.

SURVEY REVEALS

Investigations of Houghteling
Are Submitted to Univer-
sity in Doctor’s Thesis

An unskilled or semi-skilled laborer
in Chicago is more likely to have a
piano or phonograph in his home than
a telephone, but it is less probable
that he will possess a radio nr an au-
tomobile, an investigation of living
standards among the families of such
workers, directed by Leila Houghtel-
ing indicates. Miss Houghteling has
submitted the complete results of the
investigation to the University in a
thesis for the degree of doctor of phil-
osophy.

The inquiry was undertaken as a
test for the standards represented in
the model budget used by the Chicago
Council of Social Agencies in giving
assistance to needy families; to deter-
mine whether that standard is higher
than actual living conditions among
the families of unskilled and semi-
skilled workers who do not depend
upon charity.* Slightly more than half
of the families investigated are able
to maintain the Council’s standard,
Miss Houghteling concludes.

Insufficient Incomes

In 50.9 per cent of the families sur-
veyed the chief wage earners received
less than $1,400 in 1924—the year in-
vestigated—and the remainder, ex-
cluding a small percentage not re-
ported, were paid $1,400 or more. The
income from a specific occupation of

ficient to maintian suitable standards
in about two-thirds of the cases, ac-
cording to Miss Houghteling, but in-
come from other sources increased the
total sum available to many families.

The standards fixed by the Coun-
cil’s model budget are reasonable, the
investigator concludes, writing that
“the families living on a lower stand-
ard than that provided by the bud-
get estimate fail utterly to provide a
stndard of living that will make pos-
sible a high standard of physical,
mental and moral health and efficiency
for adults, the full physical and men-
tal growth and development for chil-
dren, and provision tor their moral
welfare.”

5 per cent Use Lamps

Electricity is used for lighting by
70.7 per cent of the families investi-
gated. while 23.7 per cent use gas, and
5.6 per cent rely upon lamps for light,
the report shows.

The percentage of families of the
class dealt with which go into debt is
about equal to the number which save
money, according to tables in the re-
port, showing that 31.1 per cent had
savings, while 32.1 per cent reported
debts.

Bathrooms are lacking for 56.6 per

of the tables. A large amount of other
