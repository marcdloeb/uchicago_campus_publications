Consolation Tournament
Begins at Drexel
Gymnasium

To those teams who came out on
the small ends of the scores yesterday
the glad word is again extended—
the consolation tournament will be
conducted once more this year in
connection with the major tourna-
ment. Realizing that there is an
unusually large number of teams en-
tered each year and that many of
them travel great distances to com-
pete in the event, this tournament
has been planned so that those teams
who lose in their first round games
can have the chance to show their
skill in more than one game.

The first six or seven games in the
consolation will have to be played in
the Y. M. C. A. College gymnasium
because the floor schedule for Bart-
lett gym is entirely taken up with
the major tilts. The Y. M. C. A.
gym is located at Fifty-third and
Drexel streets, about five blocks from
Bartlett. The rest of the games will

FOR THIS YEAR

Last Year Campaign Winner
Is Selected to Lead
Sales Force

Ruth Burtis, prominent clubwoman
chosen to head committee of thirty-
five women in annual Maroon week.

Because of her splendid work during
the subscription drive last year, Ruth
Burtis has been appointed General
Chairman of the second annual Ma-
roon Week, which begins next Mon-
day. The announcement of her elec-
tion was late yesterday afternoon by
Thomas Mulroy, Business Manager
of The Daily Maroon.

During the last campaign Miss Bur-
tis solicited over one hundred sub-
scriptions, which was by far the best
record made by any of the workers.
Miss Burtis is a member of the Un-
dergraduate council and Quadrangler,

“A strictly vegetarian diet, in-
cluding green vegetables and
nothing but pure water to drink”
was the prescription, and the peo-
ple around Bartlett gym, en
masse, from Coach Stagg to the
women who sell O’Henrys, are
busy carrying it out. The object
of all this attention is one small,
light brown rabbit, sent by fans
back in Mesa, Arkansas, to bring
good luck to the players from
the West Union High School of
that city.

All day long, contributions
consisting of the choicest prod-
ucts of the greenhouses are
brought to the ticket office,
where the bunny has his tempo-
rary home. His domain is a
wooden cage, painted in patriotic
purple and gold, and decorated
with a gold horse shoe, guaran-
teed to bring additional good
luck.

NEWTON, KANSAS

Starting at 9 o’clock this morning
and continuing until 10 this evening,
all of the basketball that can pos-
sibly be contained in one full day is
to be played in order to further along
the great Eighth National Basketball
Interscholastic, now in progress at
Bartlett gym.

One game each hour is the rate
at which the play is to hold sway, and
no hours are to be omitted, not even
at meal time. The tourney is now
well under way and gaining in inter-
est every minute. The second round
of the tourney is to be started this
morning when those teams which
drew byes into that round are going
to try to make them “good” byes.
There are twenty of these teams and

One surprisingly slow game, one

fair featured the end of the first
round of the Stagg classic last night.

Pueblo Beats St. Joe

St. Joseph. Mich., lost a close over-
time* tilt to Pueblo, the Colorado
Champions. Pueblo jumped into an
early lead, but two buckets dumped in
by Zetta in the closing minutes of the
play tied the game up. When the
extra period was less than a minute
old, Carlson scored for Pueblo with
a short one handed shot. This was
followed with a basket by Perkins, and
Carlson put the game on ice with a
free throw that dropped just as the
gun went off. Final score. St. Joe 26.
Pueblo 31.

St. Joe

be sandwiched in between the regu-
lar games.

Offer trophies

All of the teams that lost their
first round contests are eligible to
enter the consolation. Valuable prizes
will be awarded to the winners on
the same basis that the prizes are
awarded in the main competition.
The team prizes will be small size
basketballs and each winning player
will receive watch charm medals. So
that there will really be two com-
plete tournaments running at the
same time.

Two games have already been
scheduled as a result of yesterday’s
games. At 2 o’clock today Torring-
ton, Conn., plays Foil Valley, Ga.,
in the first consolation tilt; and at 3
o’clock Lewiston, Idaho, and Canton,
111., clash. All of these teams were
losers in yesterday afternoon’s play.
The other losers will play at 4 and
at 5 o’clock.

Expect Fast Games

The interest in this event always
runs just as high as the interest in
the main tourney and this year prom-
ises to bring forth the usual enthu-
siasm. Last year Dixie High School
of Saint George, Utah, was first
among the losers with Southeastern
High of Detroit, Mich., second, and
Franklin High of Portland third.

From the calibre of play shown
by the losing teams, even when they
bowed in defeat to slightly superior
outfits there will be a lot of real bas-
ketball in the tilts of the consolation
and it will pay the fans well to at-
tend and watch them.

Five men were tied for high point
honors at th.e end of the first day’s
grind. Welsh of Westport. Spicer of
Lexington, Palmer of Cheyenne,
Szeczkowski, of Torrington, and
Brantley of Scott County, all scored
16 points.

This high-point business is old stuff
for Welsh, Westport forward, as he
led the tournament in that department
last year. His chances to repeat that
performance this year are unusully
bright because he is situated on a
strong offensive team which is meet-
ing easy opponents. The Westport
machine should have scored about 70
points if they made only a respectable
percentage of the shots they took.

Szeczkowski, who was also strong ■
last year, made his points in vain for
the San Antonio team shoved his team
into the consolation round. The New-
ton, Kansas, outfit was doped to come
through with a big score but they did
not show unusual scoring power. Mor-
gan leading his mates with 12 points.
The Newton team played under
wraps, evidently saving themselves for
future tournament play.

Miss Burtis will select thirty-five
prominent campus women to assist
her during the Week. It is expected
that the appointments will be an-
nounced in tomorrow’s issue of The
Daily Maroon.

According to reports this week, the
first literary edition of The Daily Ma-
roon. which is to be issued as a spe-
cial feature of the campaign, good
progress is being made and the issue
will appear Wednesday as announced.
Arrangements are being made to se-
cure more special articles and features
written by prominent students and
members of the faculty. Among the
features will be an interview with Carl
Sandberg and a special article by a
prominent New York advertising man.

Issues Special Edition

The Maroon is also issuing special
evening editions to cover the day’s
basketball games, preliminary to the
drive.

As a climax to the features of the
Week, the Maroon Week committee
is sponsoring an all-University mixer
a week from Friday afternoon, from
4 to 6. in both lounges of the Rey-
nolds club. This will mark the official
close of the Week.

CITED AS WINNER1 ^

Eeach year with the starting of the
tournament, the campus dopesters
run amuck and speculate wildly about
the respective merits of the teams.
This year it really looks like they’re
going to have something really fev-
erish to discuss, namely, the team
from Newton, Kansas, that is spend-
ing these hurried days at the Beta
house.

Lost State Title

Last year the boys from Newton
won four starts out of five from
Wichita, but—the last game which
they lost was for the state title—
result, Newton lost the chance of
entering the interscholastic.

This year they’ve come with an
even better team to make up for last
year’s lost time. The outfit certainly
looks capable enough, all the men
being of the six foot type. The
smallest man on the team is only
five foot eleven, and then his team-
mates call him “Shorty.” Coach
Stewart is said to know his stuff and
has a tight defense and heavy offen-
sive outfit rolled into one. »

San Antonio, Texas, inaugurated
the tourney with a win over the Tor-
rington, Connecticut, team with a
31-26 count. A rally late in the game
by three San Antonio subs put the
game on ice. Elkins and Fiery dis-
tinguished themselves in the last min-
ute fight.

Led by Palmer, who scored eight
buckets, Cheyenne, Wyoming, nosed
out Ft. Valley, Ga., by a score of
23-30. Cheyenne jumped into an early
lead, but a scoring rampage from mid
court by the Georgia boys pulled them
up in the last half and made the game
close.

Lewiston, Idaho, was nosed out in
an overtime period game by Pine
Bluff, Arkansas. Neither team led by
more than three points throughout
the entire game, and Zimmerman, of
Pine Bluff tied it up, only to have

When the Blue Devils got through
with Ogden, Utah, old timers smiled
to themselves and seemed to see the
old Lexington team that won the Na-

from the Bluegrass state surely have
a sweet team, five men who can all
dribble, pass, shoot and pivot with the

best of them.

Opening the day’s play will be
Danville, Ky., and Salem, S. D., in
the initial game of the second round,
Salem participated in last year’s In-
terscholastic, having won the state
championship for the last two years.
Hagerstown, champion of Maryland,
plays Roswell, New Mexico’s best, at
10 o’clock. The next game is one

between Billings, Mont., and
burg, Mass. Both of these
have been represented in past
scholastics. During the noon

Fitch-
towns
Inter-
hour,

Reno., Nevada, will play Wheeler,
Miss., the same team that surprised
the dopesters in last year’s tqurney
by winning their way to the semi-
finals.

Nanticoke will represent Penn-
sylvania’s hopes when it meets the
Salt Lake City, Utah, team at 1
o’clock. Technical High of Atlanta,
Ga., plays Omaha, Neb., at 2 o’clock,
and at 3 it will be Minnesota versus
Tennessee, when Gaylord and Mem-
phis take the floor. Fargo, N. D.,
participants in last year’s meet, will
play Oak Ridge, La., in the follow-
ing match. Elkins, W. Va., meets
New Trier, Ill., local hopes, at 5.

Beginning the evening’s play will
be Breckenridge High of San An-
tonio, Texas, and Cheyenne, Wyo.,
who meets at 7 o’clock. This will be
the first game between two teams
which have won previous contests
and it should be all the more inter-
esting for that reason. At 8 the
winner of the Pine Bluff-Lewiston
game will meet the winner of the
Scott County-Canton game, and at 9
o’clock the winners of the Westport-
Mt. Pleasant and Zannesville-Newton
games will conclude the evening.

SPRING FOOTBALL
DELAYED BY SNOW

Although the weather man has tem-
porarily snowed the campus under,
coaches and players are preparing for
the spring days that are expected to
soon materialize and allow spring
football practice to be started.

Twelve freshmen that have received
numerals and five that have received
reserve numerals are expected to re-
port on the first fine day, as are the
nine varsity men that have already re-
ported themselves ready for work, and
the other dozen that have not as yet
reported.

Use Sea-sickness to

K. O. Westerners

The noteworthy success of West-
ern teams in the interscholastic for
the past few years has become a
serious problem to basketeers from
other sections of the countrv and
as a result many attempts at solv-
ing the situation have been made
by the Eastern and Southern
coaches, but with more or less dif-
ferent results. There was one sys-
tem devised at the last tournament,
however, which proved fairly suc-
cessful and which we present for
the approval of the visiting teams.

When a certain of the sombrero-
wearing fives went through the
early rounds of the tourney with
no defeats last spring, there was
great concern among the other
teams. Finally one of the local
coaches hit upon the brilliant plan
of taking the dyed-in-the-wool
Westerners out to the stockyards
to see their live cattle made dead.
The result was five westerners, all
afflicted with a certain variety of
sea-sickness, and none of them cap-
able of finishing their schedules.

THE UNITED STATES OF SPORT

(From an editorial printed in The Daily Maroon in the week of the
Track Interscholastic, 1925.)

WHAT few appreciate is the monumental value of the interschol-
astics to the Nation; a value which endures and grows long
after the pride of victory or the sting of defeat has vanished. Sand
Point, Idaho, to whom New England is a shadowy concept, conjured
up through the history and geography class, returns home with a
pride of acquaintanceship with its Atlantic coast competitors; St.
Paul, whose high school students have learned from their Civil War
histories to look with suspicion upon the South whence came slavery
and rebellion, returns to its home having played against gentlemen
and sportsmen from Birmingham, and with this experience comes
the respect and admiration which the contact produces.

The value of the Interscholastic in this respect is with difficulty
appreciated; it would be safe to say it could not be over-estimated.
The effect is not merely on the boys who make the trip. Those mak-
ing the trip to Chicago to participate in one of the two Interschol-
astic are to their fellow students as adventurers who have penetrated
the routine frontier of their horizon. Their experiences are long
repeated. They reach the length of the school, they penetrate into
homes, and ultimately reach throughout the entire community. Thus
the United States becomes, to those in distant parts of the nation, a
union of people rather than a union of geographical states. Through
sport the national solidity is advanced.

The University takes just pride in its Interscholastics. But whether
it does so or not is immaterial. In assuring leadership in sport, the
University has accepted, unconsciously perhaps, a trusteeship in
citizenship. And so long as the nation exists, the Interscholastics
must continue.

THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

Bold avowal in the editorial column of The Daily Californian:

All unsigned comments in this col-
umn are written by the editor. All
signed editorials are written by mem-
bers of the staff. In either case, the
editor accepts full and final respon-
sibility for all views advanced.

The more cautious program (by way of contrast) announced by
in the vox-pop column of The Purdue Exponent:

Articles published in this column do
not necessarily reflect the opinion of
the Exponent. The editor reserves

COMPLETE PLANS
FOR SOPHOMORE-

FRESHMAN PROM

Casino Club Orchestra To
Play April 9 at
Chicago Beach

Final arrangements were made last
night for the annual Sophomore-
Freshman Prom which will take place
Friday. April 9. in the ballroom of the
Chicago Beach hotel. The music will
be furnished by “Husk” O’Hare and
his well known Casino Club ensemble,
who will make their third appearance
of the season at traditional campus
parties,

Paul O. Lewis, president of the
Sophomore class, who, with Helen
King, will lead the right wing of the
Prom, stressed the idea last night that
the affair was given chiefly for the
members of the classes of '28 and *29.
He has made a request that one. at
least, from each couple be either a
Sophomore or a Freshman. “This
suggestion,” said Helen King, “was
brought up in both in the Sophomore
and Freshman councils."

Officers To Lead

The two wings of the Prom will be
led by the four officers, president and
vice president, of the two classes; Paid
Lewis and Helen King on the right,
and George Poole and Janet Good on
the left. The new ballroom of the
Chicago Beach hotel will be decorated
in the colors of the two classes.

The two classes are making an ef-
fort to get the limited supply of tic-
kets in the hands of Freshman and
Sophomores as soon as possible. They
may be purchased from either Paul
Lewis or George Poole at the Psi
Upsilon or D. K. E. house. Tickets
have been allotted to each fraternity.

Plan Souvenir Newspaper

A minature newspaper will be pub-
lished for the affair and distributed at
midnight to the promgoers. Several
new ideas have been incorporated in
it which will make it an innovation
in the lists of keep-sake favors pub-
lished so profusely of late for tradi-
tional campus proms and parties. The
staff has been selected of both fresh-
men and sophomores who are now en-
gaged in getting it ready for the
Prom.

Spectators Lunch
While Teams Play

Hot dogs, ham and egg salad
sandwiches, O’Henrys and Her-
shy bars will be on sale during
the Interscholastic games to re-
fresh the hungry spectators. And
for the sake of the thirsty, water-
coolers have been placed in the
gym so that it will not be neces-
sary to leave the floor. This has
all been done under the auspices
of W. A. A., which manages the
sale every year.

Women who would like to do
the selling are asked to give their
names to Adele Whitfield, who is
in charge. They are needed most
during the morning and noon
hours, as the afternoons have al-
ready been taken care of. A
table will be placed down on the
first floor where food will be sold
all the time, and women will also
go through the crowd in the inter-
vals between the halves, quar-
ters and games.

DEBATING TEAM

SETS TRYOUT DAY

Chicago-Princeton Debate To
Be Held April 17

Tryouts for the Chicago-Princeton de-
bate will be held next Friday, April 2,
at 4:30 in room 10 of the Classics build-
ing. .All those who wish to try out must
prepare a five minute speech. They
may speak on either side of the ques-
tion.

The topic as selected by Princeton is,
“Resolved, that compulsory military
training in American colleges is inim-
ical to the best interests of peace.” This
question has been discussed greatly
the last year but it is the first time
that the Chicago debaters have been
called upon to give their ideas to
the public about it.

UNIVERSITY MEN

ARE SUCCESSFUL

UPON THE STAGE

Crandall, Gendron and Miller
Active in Broadway

Production

Many former University students
may be found on Broadway in mus-
ical plays and acting with stock com-
panies. During a recent visit in
New York Mr. Frank Hubert O’Hara,
director of student activities, met
Carlin Crandall and several others.

Carlin Crandall has been starring
in New York and is now starting on a
twenty week’s engagement as lead-
ing man for a stock company. Mr.
.Crandall, while on campus was prom-
inent in dramatics and was a mem-
ber of Phi Gamma Delta. His sister,
Elizabeth Crandall, is on a tour pley-
ing in “Rose Marie."

Pierre Gendron, although, in the
movies for several years, has his first
speaking part on Broadway as the
leading man in a new play entitled,
“What’s The Big Idea?" He is a
member of Alpha Delta Phi.

Fayette Miller has just finished
a vaudeville engagement and is now
playing in a musical production in
New York. Mr. Miller was in
several campus productions last year
and is a member of Phi Kappa Sigma.

The debate will be held on Friday,
April 17, at 8, in Mandel hall. The
split-team system will be used. In
this system one man from each team
speaks on the opposing side.

The audience will vote before and
aft^r the debate to decide the win-
ner.

Permanent success, in any field, is reached
by a steady climb, step by step. The
reason why so many men reach the top
in the Kresge organization is because
they become thoroughly trained in every
phase of this great national merchan-
dising business.

With more than three hundred stores
already in operation throughout the
East and Middle West, new stores are
continually being added to the endless
Kresge chain. So there will always be
room at the top.

If you have the character, ability and
determination to win, you will find
a real future in the Kresge organization.

We expect to have a graduate of your
own college, who knows all about Kresge
policies and plans for promotion, visit
your city to give you complete informa-
tion. Write at once so that we may
arrange an interview.

STANLEY L. KRESGE

from construction work to
manager of large Kresge Store

‘‘Seventeen years ago S. S. Kresge,
founder of one of the largest groups
of chain stores in the country, offered
me the same good fortune now
offered you.

“In 1909 I left Bucknell University at
Lewisburg, Pa., having taken their
Engineering Course. The previous
summers I nad spent in construction
\ work on the D. & W. R. R.

"The S. S. Kresge Company was
small but growing rapidly and offered
unlimited opportunity. 1 was told
I would receive very little for the
first three or four years, less than I
could make as an engineer. How-
ever, I saw the possibilities of a
brilliant future.

"My experience with our company
has been one of constant progres-
sion. As the company grew, I too,
shared in their expansion. By 1913,
I was given the Youngstown, Ohio,
Store having been a manager over »
year. In 1914, the company made
me a superintendent. From 1915 to
1920, the Louisville, Ky., store was
entrusted to mv hands and in 1920, 1
was transferred to Cleveland, Ohio.
This store is the fourth largest in the
chain.

"Each year 1 have experienced a
Heady advancement, if not in posi-
• .on, then in salary- As a married
man with a family, 1 am happily
situated and financially well to do.”

Prof. Smith is the most inspiring

man on campus, and yet he under-
stands the students points of view. (I
earned a B from him.) •

Prof. Brown? Oh. he might be

all right.

Dear Turk: I notice you say in
■ the Whizzle that “the Eight Annual

Opportunity to Make
Your College Training Pay

TARGE, modern investment institutions require a high
Lt average of ability in their personnel. Customers expect
from them the most complete, veil-informed service in
every detail.

Organizations equipped to give this kind of service af-
ford broad opportunity for the exercise of ability that
should naturally develop from college training—especially
if it has been undertaken with a business career in view.



The primary requirement is a well trained, straight-
thinking mind. Without that, a man could not depend
upon his personality or his friends, to sell bonds. Nor
without it could he go far in the more technical branches
of the bond business.

Each year, Halsey, Stuart & Co. selects a limited number
of men for its various offices, from among college-trained
applicants. Before being assigned to actual work, these
men are given several months’ training, with pay, in the
fundamentals of the bond business—to give them added
foundation for development beyond the work they may
immediately undertake in the organization.
