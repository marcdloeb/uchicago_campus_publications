REV. AITCHISON
DROPS DEAD ON
STREETCORNER

Assistant To President Is
Overcome On Way To

Suburban Train

The Rev. Dr. John Aitchison, assist-
ant to the president of the University,
dropped dead yesterday morning.
Heart trouble brought instantaneous
death to the scholar and educator as
he crossed Lake Park avenue and
Fifty-third street, on his way from the
Aitchison residence at 5524 Kimbark
avenue to the Illinois Central subur-
ban station at East 53rd street.

At one time general director of the
board of promotion of the Northern
Baptist church convention, Dr. Aitchi-
son had been known over the entire
country for years as the man who
handled funds for the missionary work
of the entire Baptist church in Amer-
ica. He came to the University two
years ago at the request of the late
President Ernest DeWitt Burton, to
advise the administration and help in
the campaign for a $17,500,000 en-
dowment and maintenance fund.

Death Is Shock

His sudden death is a shock to the
entire administration of the Univer-
sity as well as to the student body,
among whom he was well known.

“Dr. Aitchison has made friends
with all the members of the Univer-
sity with whom he has come into con- [
tact,” eulogized James Hayden Tufts,
vice-president of the University and
colleague of the deceased. “He was
a man of marked ability in organiza-
tion; his personality, was character-
ized by refinement of manner, genial-
ity, and sincerity, and he rapidly-
proved the man for his position. His
death is a very great loss to the Uni-
versity, and I do not know where we
can look for a successor.”

“He was a man of the highest in-
tegrity and personal lovableness,” said
Trevor Arnett, of the Board of Trus-
tees. His tremendous ability serves to
emphasize the shock his death has giv-
en us."

Dr. Aitchison was 65 years old. His
only son, John, is a student of the
University. His wife, Estelle, and two
sisters and two brothers survive him.

LYTLE STARTS WORK
ON ANNUAL PREP
TRACK MEET

Stuart Lytle, chairmen of the 1926
Interscholastic track meet, requests
that all men who desire to work in
the meet submit their names and ex-
perience to him before spring vacation.
Lytle can be found at the Psi Upsilon
house.

“There is a great future in Inter-
scholastic work,” declares Lytle. “Not
only does it yield highly profitable ex-
perience but leads to prominent cam-
pus positions. The work entails du-
ties in various departments of the
meet. Almost any past experience fits
a man for the job.”

Lytle further urges that all frater-
nities send their freshmen and sopho-
mores out, particularly those interest-
ed in the work and not at present en-
gaged in any major activities.

SWISS PROF. FAVORS
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

That Esperanto, the proposed in-
ternational language, is one factor in
solution of international differences,
an aid in teaching foreign languages,
and an important part of child edu-
cation is the belief of Prof. Pierre
Bovet of the Jean Jaques Rosseau
institute in Geneva, Switzerland,
which he expressed before an audi-
ence at the University of Iowa.

He says that since children’s pre-
judices are acquired, that an under-
standing among children of different
races and nationalities brought about
through an international language
would do much to alleviate those
biases.

Phoenix “License
Number” Appears
On Campus Today

The “License Number” of the
Phoenix, the last issue to appear this
quarter, comes out today. Cover by
Bill Cotant, stories by Morgenstern
and Handschy and others, interior dec-
orations by Bennett and Dewey, it is
indeed a notable issue in the opinion
of the editors.

Handschy, the editor in chief, an-
nounces the discovery of a new artist,
Caldwell Dewey. He contributed a
few drawings to the last issue and is
well represented in this one.

The cover by Bill Cotant gives the
key to the issue. One of the other
features consists of some excerpts
from the “Ladies Magazine” of 1850-
’56 showing that the nineteenth cen-j
tury was not all that it is cracked up!
to be, either morally or anything else,
according to Handschy.

For this issue Handschy has also
drawn a female head supposed to be
typical of the college girl. The accom-
panying satirical poem was written by
an anonymous sophomore.

CAGE ENTRANTS
INCREASE DAILY

Two More Teams Accept
Invitations

The acceptance of bids by Mesa,
Arizon, and Breckenridge High of
San Antonio. Texas, brings the roster
of teams accepted in the National In-
terscholastic Basketball Tournament
to three, Durham, North Carolina
having accepted last week.

All these teams are state cham-
pions and have unusual records.
Mesa has won the state champion-
ship of Arizona for four consecutive
years and has a remarkable team this
year. They participated in the 1923
Interscholastic, winning two games
before being eliminated by New Trier
of Chicago. Aside from being the
best team the sagebrush state ever
tured out, they are remarkable for
their size, having four men standing
over six feet and weighing over 170
pounds.

Are Midget*

Durham, North Carolina, is dis-
tinguished by having the "Midget”
team of the tourney. Last year, they
were one of the best teams in the
Tourney, winning from. Helena,
Montana, and Devils Lake, North
Dakota before being eliminated by
Laramie, Wyoming in an overtime
game. What they lack in size is
made up for in a fast passing attack.

Breckenridge High is a new comer

FRIARS START
CAST TRYOUTS

APRILSEVENTH

First Chorus Tryout, April 8;
Lyrics Ready Next

Thursday

Wednesday, April 7 will mark the
first tryouts for this year’s Blackfriars
production, it was announced today by
Paul Cullom, Abbot. At this time
the first competition for cast parts
will take place. On the following day,
tryouts for the chorus will occur.

Because of the Basketball Inter-
scholastic which will occupy the first
week of the new quarter, it was deem-
ed inadvisable to start actual work on
the production until this time.

Need Large Cast

According to J. Hamilton Coleman,
who is again directing the show, a
large cast is called for. Accordingly,
Mr. Coleman requests that all inter-
ested men present themselves, wheth-
er they are with or without experience.

Lyrics for this year's show have,
of course, been selected. They are in
the process of being mimeographed,
and sets of them may be obtained
from Paul Cullom on Thursday or
Friday of this week. It is expected
that the music will be composed over
the Spring vacation, to be ready for
presentation at the beginning of the
quarter.

Start Poster Contest

The annual Blackfriars poster con-
test will start the first week of the
quarter.

private studios. Any member of the
University is eligible to submit his
work for Class two of the exhibit.
These will be passed upon by a com-
mittee of judges, members of which
will be announced later. All entries
for the exhibit must be in by Friday.

END SERIES OF ART
INSTITUTE LECTURES

Dr. Quincy Wright, professor of
Political Science and Dr. Wcrritt Wal-
lace Charters, professor of Education,
will close their respective series of
public lectures, which they have de-
livered during the past month in the
Club room of the Art Institute.

Dr. Wright will speak on Thursday
on the subject of “Control of Foreign
Relations”, discussing whether the
United States can carry out foreign
policies effectively without amend-
ment to the constitution. On Mar. 21
Dr. Charters will speak on the subject
of “Friendship in the Home,” explain-
ing the method by which friendly rela-
tions between parents and children
may be maintained.

“End Cribbing by
Strong Student
Opposition” - Cole

"A strong student sentiment in op-
position to cribbing is the only n’icans
of putting an end to unfair efforts at
obtaining better grades,” answered Dr.
Fay Cooper Cole of the department of
Anthropology when asked his opinion
on the subject. This answer comes in
response to many inquries on a sub-
ject which has gained much publicity
both here and at Northwestern uni-
versity.

“Development in a University itself
should create a student body willing to
uphold the principles of common hon-
esty. Cribbing and the need for proc-
tors are hardly practices worthy of
university men and women,” contin-
ued Dr. Cole. Control by the students
themselves without interference from
the faculty, Dr. Cole believes, is the
best way to solve this problem. If
they are not able to handle the situa-
tion then student government is merely
a theory and not applicable to fact.

PRINCETON TO

DEBATE HERE

Consider Question of Military
Training in Colleges

Princeton University debating
team has accepted the invitation of
the varsity team for a debate to take
place here sometime during April.
T-youta for the team will be held
the first week of the spring quarter,
and the exact date and time will be
announced in an early issue of The
Daily Maroon. All undergraduates
of the University with nine or more
majors are eligible for the team try-
outs.

The question to be discussed will
be, “Resolved: that the military train-
ing in the universities and colleges
of the country is a detriment to
peace.” The split team system which
is an innovation at the University
will be used. The night of the debate
one Princeton man will join the
ranks of the University team, while
a local man will aid the visitors.

Y. M. CALLS FOR
OLD CLOTHES FOR
SETTLEMENT DRIVE

Old clothes for the needy, is the
call of the Y. M. C. A. in a campaign
to collect cast off garments and to
distribute them at the University Set-
tlement house which can in its turn,
see that they reach those who lack
them.

As the quarter closes, the Y. M.
C. A. asks that students leave any
old clothes which they will not need
at the office of the Association, in-
stead of taking them home to be
stored or thrown away. This facili-
tates students who are moving, giv-
ing up rooms, going home, or “clean-
ing-up” to get rid of excess useless
wearing apparel and at the same time
is of definite assitsance to the needy
of the city.

Another call has also been received
at the Y. M. C. A. office with the
request that it be passed on to the
students of the University. Sum-
mer camps for Boy Scouts are search-
ing for reliable leaders to act as
councillors for the boys.

Maroon Cooperates

With this issue, The Daily Maroon
suspends publication for the Winter
Quarter. On Monday, March 29,
there will be a special Interscholastic
Issue, to start the Meet off, and to
welcome the boys who are entered
in the events.

WHISTLING STONES
GET UNDER WAY

It was Friday afternoon in The
Daily Maroon office.

In fact it is Friday afternoon
once every week in The Daily Ma-
roon office. But this Friday after-
noon was something unto itself—
and to the Whistle Club. For
where all is generally silent and de-
serted on that one day each week,
a meeting of assorted wits buzzed*
at length under the chairmanship of
Mr. Terrible Turk.

And the Whistle Club was form-
ally organized with a howling suc-
cess that actually exceeded the vivid
imagination of Colonel Stone, who
expected the campus en messe.
Twenty-five contributors—all of
them famous in Whistle circles,
many renowned outside campus lit-
erary striving—appeared and put in
a word or two here and there.

The Whistle Club has tabled the
recently received invitation to join
a national columnists’ fraternity.
Until it is better organized, at least,
the group will remain local. A com-
mittee. appointed in today’s column,
will decide on the fundamental pol-
icies of the club .

Annual Concert

Of Glee Club to

Be ^Different"

The old type of Glee club concert is
going out of style. The Glee club,
at its next appearance, April 30 at
8:30 in Mandel hall, will inaugurate
the ultra-modern Glee club recital.

Formal clothes will be replaced by
white duck trousers; Polly Wolly
Doodle All Day will be replaced by
light cassical and melodiously synco-
pated music. Lighting effects will be
used to assist the manager in his ar-
rangement of effects.

The fifty members of the Maroon
Glee club will open their spring con-
cert behind a drawn curtain and will
use recently developed and demon-
strated improved methods of creating
an opening impression.

Profiting by their previous experi-
ences with only moderately filled
houses the publicity committee of the
Glee club is making determined efforts
to fill the auditorium at their next pub-
lic appearance. Seats will he allotted
to fraternities and clubs.

DISPLAY PAINTINGS

OF CHINESE PERIODS

“A picture is a voiceless poem, a
poem is a vocal picture,” so runs the
proverb of China bearing the secret
of her art. This spirit expressed in
the old Chinese proverb is illustrated

in the Chinese paintings now on dis- j
play in the Y. W. C. A. room of Ida j
Noyes hall. The pictures have been ■
loaned for exhibtiion by Mr. Las
Uring Tasi of New York.

Co-ordination of mind, eye ever
guided by the heart, has engeneder-
ed the richness and delicacy of ev-
ery Chinese pictorial masterpiece ac-
cording to Edward F. Rothchild, in-
structor in the Art department. The
paintings represent three great pe-
riods in Chinese art. Five are of
the T’sang period from 618 to 906
A. D., seven were painted in the Sung
period from 960 to 1277 A. D. and
two are of the Yuam period from
1277 to 1368 A. D. The silk on
which the pictures are painted is
very fragile and visitors have been
asked not to handle the paintings.

By Stewart McMullen

For the first time in the history of
the University the convocation will
be broadcast. Station WMAQ has
arranged with Mr. John Van
Zant, director of radio broadcasting
at the University, to put the annual
exercises on the air at 3:30 today
from Mandel hall.

Two hundred and fifty-one degrees
will be conferred by the President
today. One hundred and eleven of
these will be Bachelor degrees,
twenty-nine master’s degrees, and
eleven Doctor’s of Philosophy. The
law schools will confer seven degrees
of Doctor of Jurisprudence Sand one
degree of bachelor of law. The
medical schools will confer 37 de-
grees of Doctor of Medicine and 55
four year certificates.

Tufts To Preside

Vice President J. H. Tufts will
preside over the convocation. It will
in all probability be his last public
appearance as a vice president of the
University, as his resignation, ten-
dered last quarter, is to take effect
the first of April.

The convocation address will be
delivered by Walter A. Strong, pub-
lisher of the Chicago Daily News.
His subject will be “Newspapers and
the New Age.”

Number Doubled

Over twice as many degrees are to
be conferred today as were con-
ferred last year. 121 graduated in
1925 and 250 will graduate in 1926.

Tickets for the Convocation may
be secured on application at the
President’s Office. Although the al-
lotment has been pretty well distri-
buted, as is customary in the Univer-
sity, among the graduating students
and their families and friends, a few
tickets are still available to those who
will apply for them.

DENVER U. GLEE CLUB
CAUSES BOYCOTT

ON THEATRE

Singing of the Glee club of the
University of Denver in local theatres
was recently made taboo when the la-
bor union of the city declared a boy-
cott of the theatres. In spite of the
fact, the club insisted upon fulfilling
their contract

{That the Glee club did not realize
the quality of their voices was evidenc-
ed by the fact that the club declared
that had not anticipated this trouble
as a result of appearing in local thea-
tres. When union officials approached
officers of the club attempting to in-
duce them to cancel their engagements
the club still insisted upon fulfilling
the contract.

i As a result of this episode labor un-
ions have sponsored discussion on
the relations of organized unions to
higher education hut as to the present
state of the enlightened Glee club the
Denver Daily is not informative.

Upon the occasion of our Spring Opening this week, March I 5 to 20, we have made
preparations to entertain great throngs of visitors. We believe untold thousands
of people in and about Chicago would feel highly repaid by a visit to this store.

There will be much to interest them—whether purchases are intended or not. The
whole store will be in holiday attire and the “open house” spirit will prevail. Every
department will be at its best, with attractive displays of new Spring merchandise.

Many special features have been arranged for the week. We can mention here but
a few of them. Complete programs will be distributed free in the store.

The Poster Show

On the Sixth Floor, South Room, will be held
one of the most extensive exhibits of Posters
every shown in Chicago. Three noteworthy
collections, British, French and American.
Lectures on poster art will be given by speak-
ers of prominence in the art world, each after-
noon at 4 o’clock, except Saturday.

Manufacturing Exhibits

In various departments have been arranged
working exhibits and moving picture show-
ings, illustrating manufacturing processes. See
printed programs for details.

The ?1 ll Out o ’ Doors Annual
Nature Exhibit

Arranged under the auspices of the Illinois
Wild-Flower Preservation Society, Chicago
Woman’s Club, and Illinois Federation of
Women’s Clubs. With exhibits furnished by
about 25 other organizations.

Fifth Floor, South Room

Twenty-two illustrated lectures and Nature
Study Conferences will be given during the
week. See special programs.

Tourist Camp

with all kinds of camping equipment, athletic
goods and outdoor requisites.

Fifth Floor, North Room

Such are the features which will characterize our Spring Opening and make our
store a place of exceptional interest for many thousands of visitors every day this
week. Make your plans now to come; and allow yourself plenty of time. If it
rains, come anyway; the special features are for one week only.

ADD IMPORTANT
BOOKS TO RARE

LIBRARY LISTS

Works on Physiology, His-
tory, and Copies of Bibles

In Collection

' Anatomy books, several copies of
the Bible, early writing on velum,
books on history and politics, consti-
tute the new additions which have
been made to the University libraries,
according to Mr. J. C. Hanson, asso-
ciate director of University libraries.

An important work on comparative
anatomy, being the second part of
“The Elephant Head,’’ published by
Copenhagen in 1925, has been pre-
sented by the authors, Prof. J. E. V.
Boas and Prof. Paulli, who in 1922
presented the first part of the same
work. According to Mr. Hanson, an
unusually fine copy of the great Ger-
man Bible was presented to the
library by Miss Lillie Oberman
Hoerr. This work was printed at
Zurich by David Gessner in 1690. At

this time the Old Testament occupied
848 pages, the Apocrypha, 199, and
the New Testament 269.

Add Copies of Bible

Two other Bibles, the Bishop’s
Bible of 1568, and the first Danish
Bible of 1550, are also to be added
to the collection of Bibles already in
possession of the University, some of
the choicest specimens of which are
here as a result of the American
Bible union and Hengstenberg collec-
tions which, with the Berlin purchase,
constituted the chief book resources
of the University when it opened.

The Wandel collection of 68 vol-
umes, containing specimens of early
writing on vellum, some of them dat-

ing back to the eleventh century,
forms a part of the manuscripts now
being purchased on the fund pre-
sented to the University by Miss
Shirley Farr of the class of 1904.

An acquisition that will be of use
to the students of modern history and
politics are the 225 volumes of the
German Heichstag Verhandlungen,
covering the period 1869-1918. It is
the hope of the library heads, said
Mr. Hanson, that they can supple-
ment this acquisition by additions to
its files of the Legislative Debates
and Proceedings, particularly of the
southern and western states.

With the opening of the new' The-
ology building and the additional

space for books to be provided for in
the new Medical buildings and in
Wiebolt hall, Mr. Hanson hopes that
the next year or two will witness
considerable improvement in the
housing facilities for the many im-
portant collections of books and
manuscripts now being added to the
University.

“THE Stranger’ in its final appear-
ance last Friday is one of the causes
to which we will ascribe our early
demise. To have worn green tights
was bad enough, but to struggle on
bravely under the realization that
the audience could see them every
time we turned around or bowed was
nothing less than poisonous. And
Paul Cullom—his over-sized colonial
uniform exhibited a most alarming
tendency to treachery. Quote Paul,
“They are supposed to play violin
music in the pathetic parts of this
peace. Whew! If these safety pins
don’t function, that fiddler is sure
going to be overworked!!’

Gymnasts Win Big
Ten Championship
Once More

GYM TEAM WINS CONFERENCE J AG AIN

Winning Champions Is. Be-
coming Habit For Hoffer’s
Men

The conference gymnastic, wrest-
ling and fencing meet was held at
Purdue Saturday. Coach Hoffer sent
his gymnasts there so you all know
how that part of the meet ended. Ohio
State grabbed two of the mat titles,
while Chicago, Minnesota and Michi-
gan got one apiece. Ohio State also
gathered in the fencing championship.

Gymnasts Up To Snuff

In the gym meet Purdue was second
with 1214.5 points as compared to the
Maroons’ 1234.8. Although Purdue
lost with apparent good grace they
were somewhat disgruntled to find
that their score was not above that of
Hoffer’s boys: for the Boilermakers
had thought, previous to the meet,
that they were about to annex the
first gym title in the history of the
school due to their surprise victory
over the Maroons some weeks ago. It
appeared, howevet, that Coach Hof-
fer had, since that defeat, given his
turners some additional tricks which
were not lost upon them. Minnesota,
who boasts of a good gym team her-
self every now and then, was third
with 1067.6 points. They were fol-
lowed by Iowa, while Wisconsin, Ohio
State, Illinois and Northwestern also
ran.

Davidson in the horizontal bar and
Connor in the tumbling gathered all
the honors that are coming to a first
place winner. The rest of the squad
had a big cut of the seconds and
thirds. If McRoy had swung the
clubs 4-10’s of a point better he would
have been tied for first place; as it
was, he finished second. Paisley, Ben-
son and Nelson substituted for the ab-
sent and injured Captain Quinn in a
fashion that left nothing for criti-
cism.

Hats Off to Hoffer

This the fifth time in the past seven
years that the gymnasts have return-
ed with the proverbial "bacon”, and
behind all this there must be a rea-
son. This reason is not “good ma-
terial,” for the boys had a very scanty
knoweldge of what a horizontal bar
and a side horse were used for (the
latter piece of apparatus they thought
was none other than the famous che-
■val of England’s ground-loving
prince). This year, for instance, the
squad was composed of four sopho-
mores who were broken in the game
last year. The reason, in brief, is
Coach Dan Hoffer, who, if he found
it necessary could make a gymnast
out of an Indian cigar sign (no reflec-
tions on his present squad meant, of
course). So what glory is due to the
gymnasts should go, for the large part,

to Mr.

Hoffer.

If all of the shots made at the
basket in last year’s Interscholastic
Basketball Tourney were placed
end to end, they would reach from
the northeast corner of Stagg Field
to the top of the steeple of the
town hall at Tonopah. Nevada. In
all of the games played in the Tour-
nament last year, the bloom and
youth of the country attired in bas-
ketball togs made 1,482 baskets.

Taking the quality of their shoot-
ing into consideration, that would
average about ten shots to every
goal made, or 14.820 shots taken
at the bucket. And not even the
most accomplished math shark
could figure out how many free
throws were attempted.

WHAT of IT?
w--------

MOWfC MORGENSTERN

Baseball language has developed
into what it is today through an ex-
ceedingly intricate process of evolu-
tion. Back in the ’80’s, when John
McGraw was holding down third base
for the Baltimore Orioles and the
(now) Rev. Billy Sunday was the
cleanup man for the Chicago
White Stockings, the jargon of
the game was not as it is
now. What is known simply as a
grounder in this day and age was at
that era yclept “daisy-cutter.”
“Pound the pill” was considered a
very fast phrase, which only the best
New York sport reporters might use.
Referring to the ball as “the old
apple” had just come into its own,
and it was, in the opinion of the
folks of the market place, the last
word in the new phraseology which
had sprung up about the diamond.

Of late years, however, few new
good words or phrases have been
coined for use in discussing or writ*
ing of affairs of the so-called national
sport. The lingo, in fact, has run
dry; all ideas for new words to add
to the baseball vocabulary have
ebbed away, and in consequence
there is a most distressing stagnation
in the jargon of the game. It was
a relief, therefore, when recently I
had occasion to talk over the Chicago
ball team’s trip to Japan with Ken
Pierce, Maroon outfielder, that sev-
eral add turns of phrase used by the
press of the Orient to report the Ma-
roon team’s games turned up. These
phrases, I thought, had possibilities
of crowding out some of our present
outworn and trite terms.

Mr. Pierce in the course of the
conversation pulled out a couple of
newspaper clippings illustrating Ori-
ental baseball journalism at its best.
The articles were written for the
'English paper of Shanghai by the
foremost authority on cricket in the
Far East. This gentleman may not
have been so hot on baseball, but I
am here to assert that he was strong
on cricket. Tennis also, it seemed,
went well with him. So, when he
failed to recall the proper technical

Drawing the curtain on the grand I
finale of the swim season, budding!
natators and veterans in the art of'
water-stroking gathered at the Uni-
versity of Michigan Natatorium last
Friday and Saturday; after much
haggling over times and gracefulness
the season champions were disclosed.

Minnesota crawled out of the jum-
ble by leaps and bounds and gathered
an enormous lead over her closest
opponent, Michigan. Wisconsin. Iowa,
Northwestern, Purdue, Illinois and
Chicago followed, rather trailed after
the victorious two.

Chicago’s chances for placing
fourth in the Conference were great
but illness overtook two of the steadi-
est swimmers who were to help the
Maroon crew in the annexing of
points. Ed. Noyes who has been a
consistent point getter and who led
the swim team to four victories last
season was unable to make the jour-
ney. Gilchrist of water polo fame
was also subdued by the grippe and
had to do his exercise in bed. Coach
MacGillivray had doped his swim-
mers to get a third place in the relay,
a fourth in the 50 yard crawl and
a third in the century, thus netting
the locals some seven points and put-
ing them ahead of Dick Howell’s
Waterloo. But Neptune willed other-
wise!

The unsurmountable obstacles
placed before the swim crew this
year such as illness and inexperience
were present at the climaxing meet
and not being fortunate enough to
have Dame Fortune rooting for the
Maroon colors, Illinois sneaked two
points through Captain O’Brian of
the fancy diving department; thus
forcing Chicago one place back.

Over at the Kappa Sig house, they

the highly honored name of “Cham-

upon none other than the versatile
Red Krogh, who was welcomed into
the Big Ten Hall of Fame last Satur-

one hundred and seventy-five pound
event of the Conference Wrestling
Meet, held at Purdue university.

To win such a title it requires one

one a victory—that is how Red be-
came f amous overnight. His last
grapple was with Cole, the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin 175 pounder en-
trant, and it was the closest of all,,
going into overtime. Red finally won
out to annex the cherished title of
Big Ten Champ—and the premier
wrestling honors in his first year of
varsity competition.

Star* A* Freshman

To those who know Red, his glori-
ous victory was no great surprise.
His all around ability as an athlete
is well known on the campus. He has
demonstrated it in the comparatively
short time that he has been connected
with Maroon sports. Numerals were
awarded him in three sports during
his yearling year. He placed second
in the Frosh cross-country race, he
was a first choice wing-man on the

Not a Fish, But a “Gator” Story

That the Eighth Annual National
Interscholastic Basketball Tourna-
ment (putting it briefly) will be a
colorful gathering, to say the least,
is assured by the wierd tales which
are drifting into the office of H. 0.
Crisler, manager of the Eighth An-
nual—etc.

Eighth Annual—

The office is in receipt of an Inter-
esting rumor which has wandered up
here all the way from Jacksonville,
Florida, its birthplace. The story is
concerned with Duval High, an entry

Freshman football squad, and he was
the only yearling to win heavy track
numerals last spring. He did this by
putting the shot.

This fall he made all of the trips
with the grid team, serving as one of
the substitute ends. When he an-
nounced his intention to try tils
hands at wrestling this winter it met
with surprise, but his all-around abil-
ity soon asserted itself in this new
line of athletic, activity, and he was
hailed as a great find by Coach Vor-
res who has had to develop a team
composed of mostly sophomores this
year.

All-Around Man

Now the Midway sport enthusiasts
are- wondering what new field Red
will enter next. Like McDonough
and Hoerger he seems able to make
good in whatever he takes up. He
hinted that he was going to try swim-
ming next year, but that was before
he had won his grappling laurels so
he may have changed his mind.

Lifetime

Write it—don’t sin£

The chances are that you’ll do a better job with
a “Lifetime” pen. And you’ll have the satisfac-
tion of knowing, when you write to her, that
you are working with the “niftiest” instrument
procurable. Of ^reen, jade-^reen radite, a hand-
some and indestructible material, is the pen

you’ll love to hold. Its nib is guaranteed for a

lifetime. But what is more important, it is an in

fallible performer. At better stores everywhere.

The high school, it seems, has, like
Northwestern, a pet mascot. But he
presents an even more ferocious
front than does the Purple’s wildcat.
For he is an alligator, yanked out of
the Everglades. He is owned by the
school, and proudly exhibited and
paraded at all the athletif contests.
His association with the prep school
lads and lassies has not been in vain
for he has been taught a few tricks
which he does very well and on one
occasion, too well.

Cater To ’Gator

His repertoire consists of two
stunts. When stroked on the back
three times he groans and rolls over
on his back, flashing an enviable set
of teeth. (We understand that he
is being featured in an advertising
campaign by some wide-awake tooth-
paste company). Then if stroked on
the stomach and addressed in a cer-
tain manner, he emits another groan
and goes to sleep. The words which
effect this phenomena are known only
to the inner circle at Duval High.

But some time ago a rival school
managed, by some hook or crook, to
gain access to the all-important
words, and as a result, caused the
Duvalite pet to indulge in commun-
ion with Morpheus. Needless to say,
the Duval team, utterly lacking in
moral support, lost the game.

This is a sample of the rumors that
are finding their way into Crisler’s
office. Take it for granted what it is
worth.

The one best newspaper account
of the lot written to the glory of God
and the “Shanghai Rising Sun” by
this gentleman had as its blood-and-
thunder melodramatic title, “The
Closest Call.” It detailed, among
things, the remarkable catch made by
Capt. Cunningham in the eighth in-
ning. “Brignail threw an imperfect
shot to him from third base,” ran the
“Rising Sun” account; “the ball
landed just out of Cunningham’s
reach, but he threw himself forward
and scooped up the ball on what in
tennis is called a half-volley.” Cun-

Nozawa of the opposition Meiji nine
at third base. “Nozawa,” writes this
amazing cricket-tennis-baseball * ex-
pert, “got a surprise when he got
within reach of third to find the ball
applied to his body by the grinning
shortstop.” This turn of phrase, I
believe, has the enormous merit of
not ever having been used before,
so far as I have been able to learn.

praised as the article swells to a mag-
nificent ending. “One must hand it
to Comrade Norgren and his merry
men that they sure can play base-
ball,” says this imposing tribute. I
have always taken great delight in
pointing out merit when it occurs.
I always like to hand out the bay
leaves all around, if there is the
slightest excuse for doing so. To the
admirable sports editor of the “Shan-
ghai Sun” I extend my heartiest
felicitations. I tell him that he has
done a good, a great work. I call
upon all baseball scribes in these
United States to turn to this estimable
gentleman for inspiration. I advise
them to carefully peruse such of his
writing as may be procured by either
love or money. For I feel that if
our home-grown baseball writers lift
enough idioms from this Shangha
genius’ stock, they will within a short
time completely reinvigorate the
jaded phraseology of the noble gam
of baseball.

Buyers of Railway Service

Upon the relationship existing between the railroads
and their patrons depends the entire future of railway
transportation, for under our present organization of
economics and government the public controls railway
service not only by purchasing it, but by regulating the
conditions under which it shall be rendered. The public
therefore is the final arbiter of railway destiny ; barring
actual confiscation, the public can do anything with the
railroads that it cares to do. That is why it is so im-
portant, as a matter of self-preservation, for the rail-
roads to deserve and win the good will of the public.

In flie same way that all of us, in the long run, pay
taxes, all of us likewise are buyers of railway service.
It is difficult to think of a commodity into the produc-
tion of which railway service does not enter in some
way. Because of this wide diffusion of railway ser-
vice and consequently of railway charges, it is highly
important that railway rates be maintained at the low-
est level consistent with the production of efficient ser-
vice and with adequate preparation for future needs.
Any unduly high level of railway rates artificially in-
creases the cost of living for all of us.

On the other hand, a level of rates too low to provide
a certain measure of railway prosperity has a tendency
to injure the public as a whole. If it necessitates a
drastic reduction in railway wages, a certain amount of
general purchasing power is destroyed. If it makes
impossible a return upon the investment, future invest-
ment is discouraged and the railway plant deteriorates
to such an extent that efficient service can no longer be
expected from it. Shortages of transportation from
just such causes have meant losses of billions of dol-
lars to the public in the past.

In order to protect both the railroads and their
patrons by maintaining the balance between high and
low rates that makes for greatest national efficiency,
the Interstate Commerce Commission at present oper-
ates as the chief railway regulatory body. Originally
designed to prevent encroachments by railroads upon
the rights of the public and upon the rights of each
other, this Commission has developed in scope and
concept as public opinion toward the railroads has im-
proved. Today the duties of this Commission com-
prehend almost all the phases of railway regulation, and
its original purpose has been so greatly broadened that
in the Transportation Act of 1920 it was expressly di-
rected, among other things, to safeguard the earnings
of the railroads, in recognition of the fact that strong
railroads can best serve the public interest.

The railroads are not natural monopolies. There are
many other means of transportation, both in operation
and in abeyance, the development of which at once tends
to increase when railway rates tend to get too high.
For this reason and also because they cannot expect
patronage from an impoverished public, the railroads
themselves have strong incentives to keep railway rates
as low as they consistently can. The public should un-
derstand and appreciate this fact Live and let live is
the best policy to govern the relationships between the
railroads and their patrons, just as it is—or should be
—the governing principle of all legitimate business.

The railroads are business concerns. All they ask
is that they be measured by the same standards which
govern other business concerns and that they receive
fair treatment from their patrons, who are also, in a
way, their managers and judges.

Constructive criticism and suggestions are invited.
