PEP ROOTERS FOR BADGERS

If, one of these crisp days, you see
a gaunt figure standing on the street
corner amidst the flurries of snow,
tinkling a tamborine and singing:

"Put a nickel in the drum,
And you’ll be saved.”

don't be startled if, on closer inspec-
tion, that figure should turn out to
be none other than your correspon-
dent. For, the fact is, I have, if net
actually come to Jesus, at least tak-
en a couple of steps in His direction
since you last heard from me. It all
is the work of the University “Y”
over at the Reynolds Club. They may
nick another notch in the binding of
the family Bible; another soul has
been saved, another convert claimed.
And it all happened because of a piece
of pumpkin pie, a cup of coffee and a
doughnut! Strange, indeed, are the
ways of the Lord.

* * •

Now, you must understand, in times
previous to this miraculous reclama-
tion, "the Y” had, if anything suffered
at my hands at such times that I gave
it any consideration at all. I had been
puzzled »about just what this ‘work
th' Y is doing,” of which I had often
heard, was. There were, of course, the
discussion groups fostered by the or-
ganization. But these I dismissed per-
functorily aS bands of simple souls get-
ting together and (in the words of
Dr. Johnson) “having a good talk”
about such elevating things as the re-
spective opportunities of amassing
what Clarence Darrow calls "units of
pleasure” in Heaven and Hell. Then,
again, there were the first and second
Cabinets, the oflicerships, etc.—open-
ings through which many a smooth
boy who later attained eminence in
campus affairs got his start- And so,
“th’ Y” was, for long years, a dud as
a spiritual haven, and its functions
were chiefly, as has been indicated, the
providing of nice, warm rooms for
bunches of not-too-smart young fel-
lows to get together in, and a place
for the campus slickers to polish them-
selves up into finished politicians. So,
naturally, my respect for the ghostly
society over on the second floor of the
Reynolds Club was limited.

* * * *

But, as I say, all this is changed
now. I see the “great work th’ Y is
doing" clearly. I am cognizant of "the
heling hand it is extending to tne
student, plodding up life’s highway.”
I am all for the Y. M. C. A. It hap-
pened this way. Yesterday afternoon
one of my friends and I were hasten-
ing back through the sweeping snow
to the Maroon office. Our path lay
through the corridor outside the Rey-
nolds Club, since we took the oppor-
tunity to get out of the cold by going
that way. On our way up this hall,
we looked for a moment into the cof-
fee shop, our faces pressed against the
panes. Never did the left-over pie from
the Commons and the coffee steaming
in its storage vat look better than
then. But, as is the way with those
who unselfishly devote themselves to
I he Maroon, we had no money. With
a sigh, we were about to pass on,
when all at once, looking through the
windows across the hall, we saw x
gladening sight.

There was pie—and even better
looking pie than in the Coffee Shop—
and coffee, too, and more—doughnuts.
They were being freely dispensed. A
friendly hand beckoned toz us. We
went within. Pumpkin pie, coffee, and
those doughnuts which we saw were
pressed upon us. With them came that
“good word” that we ask for with our
ham in the B. & G. sandwich shops
and so infrequently get. Our spir-
its revived. The cold thawed from us.
Ou/ hearts were warm for our fellow-
nian. They still are, when we recollect
the happy moment. It was the Y
open house. We were sorry we could
not stay for the discussion meeting af-
terwards. But still, I feel we are bet-
ter men for our experience with the
spiritual arm of the university, slight
as it may have been.

PSI UPSILONS TO
OPEN HOUSE FOR
FIRST TEA DANCE

Music Provided By Jones’
Cooper - Carlton

Orchestra

George Jones’ Cooper-Carlton or-
chestra will furnish the music for the

Bloom, Claire Davis, Rosalind Hamm,
Florence Herzman, Margaret Newton,
and Eleanor Scully, have been chosen
to take charge of the distribution of
tickets.

Punch and cookies will be served as
refreshments. Proceeds from the sale
of tickets will be clear profit, made
possible by donations of the clubs and
fraternities. The expense of the or-
chestra, refreshments and the printing
of tickets for this week’s dance will
be defrayed by donations front Alpha
Delta Phi. Alpha Sigma Phi, Beta
Theta Pi, Chi Psi, Delta Sigma Phi,

house. 1

These dances have been annual af-1
fairs and hav ebeen a large contribut-
ing item to the Settlement drives
which have been held at the Univer-
sity in previous years.

Lawyers Organize

Bridge Tourney

As Books Pall

Emerging intact from an epidemic
of precampaign hot air, the Law school
will attempt some diversive excitement
in the way of a bridge tournament.
Entrance fee for all who wish to en-
ter is fifty cents, and contestants must
see Sidney Podolsky or Marty Solo-
mon. A meeting to determine final
details will be held when the entry list
is complete. Teams of two are pre-
ferred.

Some sort of prize for the winners
of the play is expected to be put up.
according to those in charge of the
tournament. The leading team may
also enter in the intramural tourna-
ment later in the year.

ROOT HEADS SAINT
NICHOLAS PHOENIX

The St. Nick number of the Phoe-
nix will be the staff’s Christmas pres-
ent to the student body. This issue
will be edited by James Root, the as-
sistant editor. The St. Nick number
will be the feature number of this
quarter.. An increase of eight pages
is to be one of the attractions of this
issue.

Dinner Or Mixer?

Frosh Vote Monday

Freshman chapel Monday will be
partly given over to a vote for the
purpose of deciding which is most de-
sired, a class dinner or a class mixer.
The Board will hold its second meet-
ing of the quarter next Monday

Sell Orange Tags
Tuesday to Swell

Settlement Fund

Settlement Tag Day is next Tues-
day.

Bright, orange tags will designate
those students who have established
themselves as philanthropists in no mat-
ter how small a way, and all money
collected will go to the betterment of
the conditions “back of the yards.”

The leaders of the groups which are
to sell the tags, will meet Monday noon
in Cobb 206 where all details will be ex-
plained and tags will be given out. (It
is absolutely necessary that every one
be there, they claim.

The various groups are captained by
the following: Sigma, Harriett Lemon;
Quadrangler, Edythe Mariani; Esoteric,
Katherine Rose; Chi Ro Sigma, Mar-
ion Plimpton; Pi Delta Phi, Herberta

MAROON’ TRAVELS
ACROSS ATLANTIC

Copies of The Daily Maroon are
penetrating the remote corners of
the earth.

To Germany it is simply one
more newspaper, but to Clif Utley,
University alumni, it is The Daily
Maroon, official publication of the
University. One time sports editor
of the Maroon and campus corre-
spondent for the Associated Press,
Clif is naturally interested in the
present publication.

A letter bearing a German post-
mark reached the staff recently.
When opened it was found to con-
tain Clif’s regards to the staff and
the price of a subscription.

‘‘Athletes Study
Too Much, ” Says
Coach at Cornell

Can a student be an athlete and a
scholar?

Opinions differ. “Gloomy Gil” Do-
bie, football coach at Cornell univer-
sity complains, “The time given by
students to their academic work makes
a successful football team impossible.”
Centre college has the more usual
trouble of too much football, accord-
ing to the Kentucky Synod of the
Presbyterian church.

Dean Chauncey Boucher recom-
mends a wholesome degree of cooper-
ation of athletic and academic work.
“The University does not suffer as
much as other institutions from an
over emphasis on football,” he stated.
President Max Mason at Senior chapel
urged the students to work equally
hard at football and studies.

P EPARE CRACK
DEBATING TEAM

Prime Maroon Speakers
For Sydney

Warned by the debate fiasco of 1925
when Cambridge men completely out-
classed the University team, faculty
members of the University are work-
ing towards developing a crack team
to meet the Sydney representatives
next Tuesday evening in Mandel hall.

George Gentry, Marvin R. Schae-
fer and Max Swiren, the three veter-
an debaters who will meet the Aus-
tralians, have been working under
Prof. E. A. Burt on the negative side
of the question, “Resolved that thg
results of the great war have tended
toward the peace of the world.”

All three members of the Maroon
team have had wide experience in or-
atory. Swiren was director of the
Cook County Speaker’s LaFollette or-
ganization and a member of the speak-
er’s bureau of 1920, national Republi-
can committee.

Schaefer was member of the state
championship team of Cotner College
Nebraska, for two years and in 1921
won an extemporaneous speaking con-

ARMY-NAVY BALL
INVITATIONS NOT
BEEN SJNT YET
Girls Receive Personal Bids
But Engraver Holds
Others

Rumors that invitations to the
Army-Navy Ball next Friday at the
Drake Hotel had been received by
two campus women were disproved
last night when announcement was
made by Dean Edith Foster Flint that
the invitations had not yet arrived
from the engravers.

One hundred and thirty campus
women will be mailed invitations as
soon as they come from the engrav-
ers.

Tomorrow again, with an unbroken record of conference de-
feats, Coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, and his bloody, battered football
team begin. And they can’t find inspiration in “Opponents 110;
Chicago 40.” They can’t find inspiration in the thought that to-
morrow’s showing means major, minor, or no letters. But they can
find inspiration in knowing that their school isn’t a fair-weather
friend; we are with them even though they’ve lost four out of five
conference games and are doped to lose the fifth tomorrow, that we
are with them not because they have done better or worse but be-
cause they have done their best. .

Tonight we have our last chance to demonstrate the greatest
faith in the world—faith in the losers. On the eve of its dying swan
song the University of Chicago football team of 1926 doesn't ex-
pect an ovation. It expects its bored classmates to drift into what
is called a pep session, to leer in a dismal, supercilious manner at
the efforts of professional enthusiasts. Tonight we must give them
an ovation.

Enthusiasm will reign tonight in Ann Arbor and Northwestern.
Loyalty will reign in Chicago.

THE IMPORTANCE OF FOOTBALL

in the Madison Times—“University a Total Loss on

HEADLINES

Account of Football and Advertising.”

They were speaking

of colleges in general and the University of Wisconsin in particular.

Well, this head may, in fact probably is, an adequate illustration
of the newspaper man’s attitude toward colleges. The sport writers
of the country probably gauge the college by the football teams they
produce. Thus Nore Dame is a first rate school and until recently
Northwestern was a terrible one. This may be the natural attitude
of one whose life is spent describing the athletic activities of the
nation’s colleges, but it is no mistaken one.

So far we haven’t won a conference football game this year,

and we probably won’t win any. And yet most of us would
that the University is in better shape than it was a few years
when our football team had the Conference championship.

say
ago

After all, for most of the students, football occupies but
hours a week for two months of the college year, and to them

two
it is

far less important than to the non-college public. And when sport
writers find this out they’ll be better off. If they come to this campus
and ask the first few students they meet who the real undergraduate
leaders are they’ll find out in short order.

It may be true that a few minor universities use their football
teams as advertisements, but we would never place such a charge
against any member of the Big Ten.

A college cannot be interested in education if it finds adver-
tisements of this sort useful. And in spite of everything, most of •
the universities are still interested in education.

Younger Generation Proves Itself Not Altogether Atheistic

“TIME OF MAN”
WINS PRAISE FOR

ALUMNA AUTHOR

Elizabeth Madox Roberts, who re-
ceived her degree of Ph. B. at the
University in 1921, has recently pub-
lished a novel, “The Time of Man,”
which is receiving favorable re-
ception at the nanCs of the critics.
This is the second of Miss Roberts’
published works, the first being “Un-
der the Tree," a book of poems.

“The Time or Man'' is a story of
the illiterate squalid people of the
tobacco plantation. It centers about
the life of a sensitive girl, who, in
spite of humiliating toil and ignor-
ance, is keenly responsive to the
beauty of nature around her. In its
entirety the story is poetic in mood,
and the lives of the individuals which
figure therein are depicted with in-
sight and sympathy. We can expect
nothing less when a poet writes a
novel. Miss Roberts is familiar with
her subject, she herself being a na-
tive of Kentucky.

The author's ability to write was
manifested early in her life, for as a
student at the University she was a
member of several literary organiza-
tions. Poor health which prevented
her from taking part in other activ-
ities on campus persisted throughout,
the writing of her latest book.

Miss Roberts is a member of Phi
Beta Kappa, and in 1917 received the
David Blair McLaughlin prize for
excelence in writing English prose.
She was awarded honorable mention
for work in the Junior Colleges, was
granted a scholarship in English and
was graduated with special honors in
that subject.

Miss Roberts went to California
after the publication of “The Time
of Man,” to regain her health and to
work on another novel.

Football Players
Find New Thrill

It has been rumored that members
of the football squad have been slip-
ping off to see the latest college movie,
"The Quarterback," in spite of the
report that they refused an invitation
to view it at the Tivoli as the guests
of Messrs. Balaban and Katz. It may
be that they want pointers, for the
game in the picture coached by Yost
of Michigan, is popularly claimed to be
the best ever produced on the screen.
Or they may just want to find out
how it feels to watch a game.

If any of Coach Yost’s plays are
transmuted to them from the screen,
Wisconsin may rue the day when
Richard Dix aspired to become a
football hero.

OFF THE SHELF

The “Spite of Heaven,” by Oliver
Onions, is a rather unconvincing book
of modern stamp. Somewhat like “Va-
riety,” this lacks the emotion and hu-
man nature of the German play. Per-
haps the author meant the story to be
that of some blase, but, in any case,
the story is dull for those who have
not had similar experiences. Such a
thought would indicate that Onions
has not adequately placed his facts be-
fore the reader.

But in its restraint of description yet
poetical atmosphere the story is com-
mendable. With a total submission to
fate, the “Spite of Heaven” ends its
tale of woe.

“DRAGON’S BLOOD”

Miss Romer Wilson, who will be
remembered as the winner of the
Hawthorndon Prize and an unusually
promising young author, has again
produced a remarkable story in her
“Dragon’s Blood,” which was publish-
ed Monday. It does not often fall
to a reviewer to offer nothing but
praise for a contemporary work, but
in the case of “Dragon’s Blood,” we
have nothing else to offer. The char-
acters are well drawn and convincing,
the plot carefully constructed, and the
style eloquently poetic.

The scene is laid in post war Ger-
many. Friedrich Storm, a peasant ris-

GREY TOWERS

Anna Morgan, Amid Her Heirlooms
Talks of Ibsen and Maeterlinck

By Jonquil Stevens
Athwart the stormy, wind-swept skies
Grey Towers upward, heavenward rise
Symbols of great and mighty power
For common good and high endeavor.
And stone bn stone they stand, thy walls
Steadfast and true, till thy standard
falls.

The dead dank leaves lie scattered all
around

Blozm by the wind's zvild will upon the
ground

The storm birds circling cry and call
And a grey mist rises over all.

O Grey Tozecrs! Grey Towers! looming
through the rain •

Can my heart forget its bitterness and
pain

Remembering those grey towers afar
across the sea

Which once meant home and joyousness
to me!

Forgetting these I can but turn to thee,
In loyalty. Grey Towers, eternally.

Man ’s Quest for
God Described By

Oxford Authority
—J.—

“The story of man’s quest for God,”
is accepted as a fitting synonym for the
Bible, yet few people ever think of the
intricate history and antiquity such a
quest must have. Dr. Elias Lowe, noted
paleographist from Oxford, who re-
cently lectured here, used this as the
theme of his lecture on, “How the Bible
Came to Us.”

"The Bible,” he stated, “is not just
one book, but a collection of books,"
and he picturesquely described them as
"torches in a dark forest.” For genera-
tion after geneartion of Hebrews it was
handed down orally and not until 100
B. C. was it put into writing. The old-
est manuscript known is written in He-
brew, dating back to the fourth or fifth
century, and from the Hebrew it was
translated into Greek, though the
Greek manuscript, Sinaiticus, was not
discovered until 1844. Forty-three leaves
were found in the waste basket of an
old monaster}- and given to their dis-
coverer, but later when their value was
learned the remaining eighty-six leaves
were closely guarded by the monks.

There were many translations after
that, the lecturer explained, in Latin and
other ancient languages but these grad-
ually decayeti due to the changes of the
times. In the year 382, the Pope asked
St. Jerome to make a new translation;
an almost suiterhuman task, which he
finally accomplished by going back to
the ancient Greek and Hebrew transla-
tions. This is really the translation
upon which our present version is based.

To illustrate his lecture Mr. Lowe
showed slide pictures of well-known
manuscripts, with their initialed page
and illustrations.

en to the rank of professor in the Uni-
versity of Berlin, meets a young aris-
tocrat, Walther von Markheim, and
they become close friends. Markheim,
who seems to hold the secret of life,
becomes Storm’s idol. The idol, how-
ever, as Friedrich finds, has the usual
feet of clay.

“HARMER JOHN”

“Harmer John,” by Hugh Walpole
is a mediocre bit of fiction, and decid-
edly so. Hjalmar Johanson, or Har-
mer John as the inhabitants of Pol-
chester, England, have contracted the
young Swede’s name, is an idealist,
pure and simple, who tried to ma-
terialize his ideals of beauty in every-
thing about him. The author tries to
weave a web of mysticism about him
by attributing to him almost super-
human power and force, but this is
largely destroyed by too minute and
often tiresome description and narra-
tive.

Mr. Walpole differs from most mod-
ern authors in that he tries to imbibe
many little sermons, especially in the
recounting of the thoughts and ideals
of Harmer John. Some are very blunt-
ly put, and sound rather “preachy,”
but some few can be unearthed only
in the mind of the reader. For one
who desires a light story which re-
quires practically no effort on the

By Ruth G. Daniel

The first prompt book ever used in
America, a little black spinet chair now
two hundred and ten years old, a faded
blue sofa from the court of King George
the Third—these things and more I
gazed at with intense interest as I sat
talking with Miss Anna Mogan in her
apartment over on East Delaware Place.

Proud of Antiques

“This scarf” Miss Morgan told me,
and she pointed to a large black shawl,
with huge roses embroidered in red, “my
mother made it, and so it’s almost a
hundred years old. The painting on
the east wall, that one of the court lady-
in-waiting, it’s the work of a grand-
uncle, and so it’s old too, very old. In
fact everything in this little “Grimm’s
fairy-tale’ home of mine is aged, even
I, I'm not so young any more.” And
she smiled, a quaint smile, the studied
smile of an aristocrat—this woman who
back in the eighties was already known
as the famous dramatic reader, and has
since won repute as dramatist, author,
critic.

Production of Ibsen

"But my work, the work I’m so tre-
mendously interested in, I’ll tell you
something of that. Recently, you re-
member, the play, ‘The Master Builder”
was again produced in Chicago. Thirty
years ago, on March 21, I gave in the
Powers theatre the first English pre-
sentation in America of an Ibsen play—
and it was ‘The Master Builder.’ The
production of this piece was an event
of great dramatic importance in Chicago,
and, I might add, in America, for it was
one of the earliest efforts to product1
the literary drama which later became
known as the New Theatre Movement
and The Little Theatre. I was greatly

ON THE BOARDS

By William Jost, Jr.

There comes an epoch to every man
—and we beg to include collegians—
when we view upon our hustle-bustle
with the complacent aspect of industry.
Such an epoch permits little or no su-
perfluous divertisement — excluding
those of dominant desire and duty—
and the theater has been made to suf-
fer; if we may so term filling two seats
with critical collegiate guests. In
short, we have not lately attended the
theatre. However, family points of
view, those of paid critics and those
of paid “public contact” agents are
loaned for what we offer as second-
hand evaluations.

THE RUNAWAY ROAD

The attempt to launch on the Chi-
cago Rialto something “arty,” and yet
commercially independent, something
subject, sums up in short measure the
underlying purpose of the activity at
the Studebaker.

The Repertoire Company under the
direction of Mrs. Insull plans to pro-
duce plays of significant thesis, plays
of drama-turgical perfection. The se-
lections shall include—on the most
part—pieces of contemporary authors,
pieces of new treatment and if pos-
sible of new theme. Mrs. Insull’s sea-

part of the reader, “Harmer John” is
commendable, for there is surely no
intricacy of plot or thought anywhere.

“THE PIPER’S FEE”

"The Piper’s Fee” by Samuel Hop-
kins Adams deals with the head of an
arrogant and intrenched anachronism,
Augusta Ruyland, who had no ambi-
tion but for the Ruyland family and
no progeny but the Ruyland mills. In
her monarchy she reigned supreme, in-
spiring fear and demanding respect.
Not only was her influence felt hi her
own family, but others who crossed
her path were bended to her will and
often broken. At last, however, some
were strong enough to break away
from her influence and live their lives
to their own satisfaction. That is
where Dorric Selover played her part.
She stood for motives when she
knew that they were right and re-
fused to do Mrs. Ruylands bidding,
consequently she eventually com-
manded her respect and revealed to
her a new conception of things
through her unbroken spirit. It is a
strong book, and, we feel, well writ-
ten.

interested in it at the time; I am still
more interested in it today.

Meets Maeterlinck

“Just at the time of the production
of the Isben plays,” Miss Morgan con-
tinued in her charming way, “Maeter-
linck appeared on the literary-dramatic
horizon. At tl\e time when I decided
to produce his one-act play I visited in
Europe. A friend and I went to Ghent
to seek out the great author. But no
one in Ghent had ever heard of Maeter-
linck, the man about whom all literary
America was talking. We finally found
him in Oostacker. From the nature of
his writings I had expected to find
Maeterlinck a thin, pale, aesthetic look-
ing man. Instead, I found a man the
picture of health, with ruddy complex-
ion, and eyes—

‘-------- too expressive to be blue,

too lovely to be gray...........*

He was cordial but reticent, spoke
French only, and asked many questions
about art and literature in America.

“After my return to America I re-
ceived a charming letter from him in
which he referred to my brief visit, ad-
ding that ne had found in me ‘one not
at all a stranger.' I prize these words
highly, from such a man as Maeter-
linck.

Establishes Studios <

"Twenty-nine years ago, when I went
into the Fine Arts building and estab-
lished the Anna Morgan Studios, I de-
termined to abandon altogether the giv-
ing of plays, and to confine my efforts
wholly to educational and cultural work,
the development of the speaking voice,
interpretative readings, and the study of
literature. I have striven to accom-
plish my purpose. Whether I have or
not is in the hands of my critics, in the
hands of the vast public.”

son will be marked with good drama,
good rendition and is worthy of rec-
ognition and approval by even the
most pragmatic, yet play-loving col-
legians.

The Goodman Theatre effort has
been received with too little enthusi-
asm and it may be despairingly hoped
for that this larger specie of the same
germ may generate into avalanches of
approval. We look to Mrs. Insull with
something of the same that resident
managers must have looked to the la-
ter Ibsen.

LOOP-BOUND

Glen Hunter opens in the Black-
stone following Mr. Skinner’s unex-
pected short stay, in “Young Wooley.''
Mr. Skinner always attracts a large
University group and so—“we’ll see
you at the Blackstone.”

Gregory Kelly opens at the Selwyn
on Monday with “The Butter and
Egg Man.” Mr. Kelly you first saw
in that excellent musical comedy at
the old Colonial in which
you first heard “I Love You.” New
York has been viewing “The Butter
and Egg Man” with seemingly prodi-
gious acclamations for the past twelve
months. Mr. George E. Kaufman
wrote the piece and if his past offer-
ings may go for criteria, we look to
viewing “The Butter and Egg Man”
for a howling good evening.

Tower Offers New
and Varied Program

The Tower theatre is presenting a
very atractive program this week end
with five acts of good vaudevile and
the photoplay “Midnight Lovers.”
Lewis Stone as Bill Ridgewed, a
British air ace and Anna Q. Nillson
as Diana Fathergill make a good pair
as man and wife in this light love
drama.

The beginning of the play portrays
Bill Ridgewell who is a nationally
known hero as a shaking groom and
his future wife as a nervous Circe.
(It was evidently the first time they
were ever married). However, Bill
has to return to the fyont and leaves
his wife at home. The incidents
which happen while he is away make
this love skit very interesting.

SOCIALLY--------------------

-SPEAKING

The social season this fall is aston-
ishingly busy, for us. It is well known
that campus society at Chicago nas al-
ways been a more or less minor af-
fair. Just now, however, everyone
seems to be blossoming forth with
new houses and house dances, teas and
receptions until the position of social
editor is more than merely honorary.
The calendar for this week-end bears
me out—and adds confirmation to the
suspicion which the faculty is develop-
ing that maybe we don’t spend all of
our time studying.

Today, we have the first settlement
tea dance at the Psi U house, a Pi
Delta Phi tea dance for their pledges
at Ida Noyes, and a Kappa Nu house-
warming tea at their new house, to
keep the afternoon from boredom.
Kappa Sigma is giving a house dance
in the evening. Hitchcock Hall is
opening their fall activities with a
dance, and Mortar Board is giving a
party for their pledges in a north side
studio.

The list of tea dances after the
game looks like a fraternity directory
It is—Phi Psi, Phi Gam, Alpha Sig,
Delta Sig, Sigma Nu Kappa Nu, Psi
U, Beta, Delta Chi, and Sigma Chi,
according to the latest returns.

Saturday night, an unusual night for
campus parties, is also filled up, Phi
Beta Delta’s dance will be held at
the Drake and Chi Rho Sigma’s at
the home of one of the members in
Oak Park. Pi Lambda Phi, Lambda
Chi Alpha, Acacia, and Zeta Beta Tau
are having house dances. And so the
week-end closes.

Next week the great event of the
autumn quarter takes place—Inter-
fraternity Ball. It is to be at the
Shoreland, which brings it much near-
er to the University and makes it even
more popular than in former years.

Ether, Barking Dogs and Supplies!

Form Background of Campus Poet

Working among the supplies neces-
sary to be psychology department^
amid an odor of ether and to an ac-
companiment of barking dogs, John
B. Breen, supply chairman, composes
poems.

Mr. Breen left school and went to
work after completing the fourth grade,
“quiting school in the 4th grade was
the usual thing at that time,” the poet
said, “but I was interested in studies
and read considerable.” Poetry has been
and still remains his favorite form of
reading matter, He, however, had
never thought of writing poetry until
some six years ago, when at the age
of fifty-one he began to write verse.

Publishes Poems

Up to the present year he wrote
poetry simply because he enjoyed it, but
sensing a field for his talent, he has had
his poems published under the title of
“Poems.” These poems are printed in
a small pamphlet dedicated to Lady
Astor. Among the collection are: “To
Nancy Astor,” “Ambition,'” “Watiety”
and “John Barleycorn.” In addition to
this he has had two of his poems set
to music. One of them, “That Old
Highway,” is a waltz, and the other, “In
the Days of the Chimpanzees,” is a fox
trot song.

Aside from the fact that he writes
poetry and takes care of the supplies
in the Physiology building, Mr. Breen

Goodspeed Lauds
Religious Interest
At U. of Michigan

By Lucille Price-Benedict

The youngest generation is ont com-
posed entirely of atheists and agnostics.

This is the conclusion which Dr. Ed-
gar J. Goodspeed, professor in the de-
partment of theology, has reached from
a study of the School of Religion at
the University of Michigan. The
school was founded by students, the
majority of whom were undergrad-
uates, as an expression of their inter-
est in religion.

Professor Goodspeed makes the trip
to Ann Arbor each week to give two
courses in the school on Monday after-
noons. “I am extremely pleased with
the deep interest which the students have
shown in biblical matters, and with the
warm reception which they have ex-
tended to me,” said Dr. Goodspeed.

Last year Professor S. J. Case, of
the theology department, lectured at the
School of Religion. “It is hoped,” said
Dr. Goodspeed, “that Dr. Campbell Bon-
ner will visit us for a quarter.”

“I am trying to awaken people to a
realization of the Bible,” Dr. Good-
continued. “The book ought to be read
as units of coherent thought or as a
modern narrative. It is to fascilitate
this as much as to translate the spirit
as well as the word of the Bible that
modern writers are translating it into
colloquial speech.

“The language employed in the orig-
inal text was, as has been proven by
countless papyri, colloquial, not classical
Greek. The King James version is a
lofty work, but it does not represent the
original, nor can it be comprehended by
the average man.”

Professor Goodspeed’s version of “The
New Testament—An American Transla-
tion" is not only colloquial in tone, but
it even employs all the modern tricks of
spacing and print and punctuation.
“Most readers,” said Pro. Goodspeed,
“are surprised at the frequency with
which conversational passages occur, in
comparison to the few in The King
James version, but this also is due to
the translation of the spirit of the
Bible.”

M. Breen’s latest poem, “The Isle of
Shipwrecked Dreams,” is as follows:

I sailed my bark, she was wondrous
fair

With a cargo of wonderful dreams
Built from castles in the air

Her spars of rainbow beams.

Youth and speed were in her stride,
She cared not for wind or tide

This beautiful bark of mine. >

I sailed my bark to an unknown isle
Where beauty and riches were every-
where,

They say that fortune saves her smile
For those with courage to do and
dare,

But I know not of the breaker’s roar

The sunken reef, the storm tossed shore
Of that isle of shipwrecked dreams.

On that jeweled isle of pleasure supreme
My bark does shattered lie, .

Crushed by the sunken reefs

As we tried to pass them by.

Gone is my cargo, my rainbow spar

That I had labored to bring so far

To that Isle of Shipwrecked
Dreams.

VARSITY BATTLES FROSH TO STOP
WISCONSIN ABACK; WORK PASSES
UNDER BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS

first Scrimmage of Week
Goes Well For
Maroons

Coach Stagg turned weather man
last night and decided that since the
stormy weather was going to continue
all through the week he might as well
start getting the men used to playing
in the snow. So the long delayed
scrimmage was started early and the
team kept at it till the falling flakes
obscured the ball.

Csing the proverbial ounce of pre-
vention the coaches sent the whole
team through fifteen minutes of warm-
ing up exercises and calisthenics to
lessen the danger of pulled tendons
in the cold. Then the frosh were turn-
ed loose against them with a whole
string of Wisconsin plays. The var-
sity line managed to break up practi-
cally every one.

During the entire session The Old
Man kept all of the players continual-
ly jumping in and out of the scrim-
mage. When it became evident that
the linemen were stopping every play
the tables were turned and the varsity
was given the ball for the last half
of the afternoon. With Marks throw-
ing to several sets of receivers out
each time the frosh were showered
with passes. Once in a while a line
plunge slipped in and worked for ten
or twenty yards surprising the de-
fensive line considerably. The back-
field of Marks, McDonough, Klein
and McKinney worked the plays es-
pecially well.

Luck continues to be with the Ma-
roons in the way of injuries. In spite
of the slippery footing the gridders
came through the stiff workout with
the no-injury rule still holding. With
the exception of several muscles stif-
fened by the cold the team is all set
and judging from their work against
the frosh are ready to spring a sur-
prise attack on the Badgers.

It All Depends

\ victory in Saturday’s game would
give the Badgers a .600 percentage for
the year and place them above both
Minnesota and Illinois, should the lat-
ter pair lose their games with Michi-
gan and Ohio, respectively, which is
not unlikely.

Badgers Arrive at Noon;
Have Rousing Send

Off .

Madison, Wis., Nov. 19, 1926.—The
Badgers left Madison at an early hour
for Chicago where they ring down the
curtain on the 1926 grid season tomor-
row at Stagg Field. A rousing send-
off was given the squad by the stu-
dent body, both at the station and at
an open practice held last evening
at Camp Randell Stadium for that pur-
pose.

The Wisconsin party will arrive in
the Windy City shortly before noon
and establish headquarters at a south
side hotel, the name of which is being
withheld by Coach Little in an ef-
fort to keep his boys in seclusion. A
brief workout is slated for this after-
noon prior to the Maroons’ practice at
the field.

Many Vets

Ten senior Badgers will strip their
grid togs for the last time after the
Maroon game tomorrow. Those men
who complete their football careers
under George Little are Captain Har-
mon, Burrus, Wilke, Kreuz, Barnum.
Kasiska, Leitl. Straubel, McGivern,
and Larson. There is a possibility
that many of these veterans will not
start the game, but all of them, ex-
cepting Larson, will undoubtedly see
action. Larson was lost to the squad
some time ago due to a serious knee
injury.

Have "Drive”

The Badgers have exhibited the
same drive all week that was shown
in the Iowa victory last Saturday and
practically no shifts have been made
in the lineup. Little is well pleased
with the work of Rose and Kresky
in the backfield and this pair of sopho-
mores are certain to start tomorrow.
Burrus, whose injury has healed, will
be at his old right end berth.

Tom Lieb has spent considerable
time this week correcting the timing of
his line’s charge to prevent a recur-
rence of the frequent off-side penalties
inflicted upon Wisconsin in recent
games. The Cardinal mentors are not
taking the Chicago encounter lightly,
even though Stagg has yet to win his
first Conference battle this fall.

N. Y. U. Work* Out

On Stagg Field

New York University, one of the
undefeated eastern universities
worked out yesterday afternoon on
Stagg Field, on their way to Lin-
coln, Nebraska, where they will
play the University of Nebraska.
They greatly resembled the Wild-
cats of Northwestern, in their uni-
forms of purple and white, and
their well balanced team work.

While New York's schedule, for
the past season, has not included
the hardest teams in the east, nev-
ertheless, their showing, of no de-
feats, is creditable enough to war-
rant a hard fought contest when
they meet the leaders of the Mis-
souri Valley Conference.

WEATHER SLOWS
FROSH PRACTICE

Chicago’s first Army-Navy game
Will take place Monday afternoon
when two Frosh teams representing
the two branches fight it out for the
Championship of the service. Tuesday
afternoon the football season at the
University will be officially closed by
a game between a third Freshman
group and the varsity reserves.

Last week twenty men were pick-
ed from the freshman squad to form
a team which was to battle the varsity
subs. The remaining yerlings were
divided into two teams, which are be-
ing coached by Jimmy Pyott and Bill
Abbott.

Because of the inclement weather
it has been impossible for the teams
to get in much practice. As soon as
the plan was devised "Old Man Win-
ter” set in and since then it has been
practically useless to try and get the
whole team together. Because of this
fact and that the teams which have
been working together all season have
been broken up, no special system of
play will be used. All plays will be
started from a punt formation.

Badgers Hold Edge

Thirteen victories, a dozen defeats
and a quartette of tie games constitute
the record hung up by Wisconsin’s
football team in their thirty-two years
of grid relations with Chicago. It re-
mains to be proven at Stagg Field
Saturday whether or not the thirteen
jinx will be a stumbling block to
George Little’s boys.

Yo Ho, Ah Ha, Me Too—Madison
Has “Lasalle St. Coach Staff”

Chicago is not the only Big Ten
school that has tolerated a grumbling
and a muttered rumbling from the
outside element because of the losing
tendencies of its football team. The
team the Maroons play Saturday, Wis-
consin, has had exactly the same
thing io struggle against. In fact
such interruption has been so bother-
some that the Daily Cardinal was
moved to write an editorial about it,
following the Badger win over Iowa.
Excerpts from the editorial are as
follow:

“Probably Roundy and others of his
cult in the world of sport scriveners
will stop pounding on the anvil, now
that Wisconsin has won a game. Pool
room enthusiasts will be all for Little
now. The experts who haunt the bar-
ber shops and gambling joints will
now start singing the praises of Geo.
Little and Co. If we win the Chicago
game this coming Saturday, the sea-
son will be a “success” in the eyes of
the sporting world. Then business
men out in the hinterland will decide
that Wisconsin is a pretty good school
to send their sons to.

“We hope that the game yesterday
will have accomplished one thing
above all else. We hope that it will
have silenced the rumblings of dis-
content with the present regime
among certain alumni bodies. These
alumni should realize that we have a
good coach, a good team and plenty
of school spirit. Wherever they go,
they need not be ashamed of their
Alma Mater. k

“Wisconsin is not headed for the
bow-wows. She has reversals, like
any other school, but she is ever pro-
gressing, under capable leadership.”

Again The Name Of

Meigs—Frosh Star

The proud accomplishment of
playing regular freshman football
for two seasons, and of trundling
around hundred pound blocks of ice
during the summer to get into con-
dition belongs to George (Scoop)
Meigs, cousin to the famous “Babe”
Meigs, All-Conference tackle of the
Maroons years ago who is to speak
at the pep session tonight. George,
though good varsity material,, has
thus far found it impossible to hur-
dle his scholastic difficulties.

HOCKEY GAMES
ARE POSTPONED

Final hockey games which will de-
cide the championship team of the
women’s tournament series have been
delayed due to the snow and ice cov-
ered condition of the field. Games
scheduled for Wednesday and Thurs-
day of this week will, permitting a
dry field, be played the first of next
week.

The remaining games to be played
are. for the first day, senior vs. soph-
more and junior vs. freshman. On the
second day seniors play juniors and
freshmen play sophomores. The se-
nior team, lacking the full quota of
players, holds the lead to date. Fresh-
men previously held the lead and fee)
they have a chance at the champion-
ship.

0-0 Deadlock

Fighting for their dear old “Frat
Clubs” through the thick of a blinding
storm, two teams, yesterday afternoon
were snowed under 0 to 0. It was
a real white wash. John Howe, gen-
eral manager of Intramurals, is quot-
ed as saying that it was one of the
best games of the year. The spirit
that motivated the players to brave the
weather and take the field was echoed
in the intensity of play, the stonewall
defense exhibited by each team and
the fight until the last whistle.

The contest was between the U.
U.’s and the Phi Sig’s. It was grant-
ed that the D. U.’s held a slight edge
with Clark starring.

Re-Schedule Games

The weather has been very detri-
mental. lately, to the Intramural
sports and has caused many postpone-
ments. Any teams that were sched-
uled to play and then were notified by
the Intramural Department that their
game was called off because of the
weather are to call at the I-M office to
see when these games will be played
off.

HEARTBREAK
Heartbreak is such a little thing.
It only means that I shall never fling
Out to the skies, songs that I used to
sing.

It only means that I shall never care
For loveliness in any lovely thing.

It only means that I shall never dare
To pause at dusk in this still room,
Lest I should turn and find you there
Ghost-like before me in the gloom—
Ah, yes—it is a little thing—
Days shrouded in stark emptiness.
Nights weary with remembering . . .
Why, that is all that heartbreak is.

ABATTEMENT

All the bitter irony of life trickles
down like drops of acid on an open
wound which is the soul.

Life—a tragedy by an excellent
poet—a worthless play with no curtain,
to lower—I must play the role.

Believe in nothing—hope for every-
thing—get it—and then the utter de-
spair of ever having, from brutal gods,
the things we ask for—things desired
—unwanted.

The cruel fulfillment of all wishes
—the strains of tender music lashing
the heart with hopes and dreams un-
realized—never understood—and al-
ways granted ....

Curious arrangement of merciless
logic for a futile purpose—Life’s love
is a word to justify, by the rottenest
kind of deceit, the filthy instincts
which master us—instincts of hate—
selfishness—loathesome cruelty . . . .

There is no love, no honor, no pur-
ity—these are but names of tilings
dangled before us—glimpsed in the
half light of dreams and flickering
away like the smile of a harlot, turned
down in the street—things—things—
things—ideals—whose very nonexist-
ence is a challenge to inextinguishable
longing—Something beautiful held be-
fore a suffering horde of men, afraid
to face themselves—revolting at the
reality they wallow in ... .

Delectable ideals thrust down their
throats with a vengeful fulfillment to
produce nausea . . .

There is nothing true but self, self,
self, self.... seeking.... yarning for
its gain.... cheating.. paying false
coin.... snickering off in the darkness
.. believing it is deceiving others.. de-
ceiving others.. .being deceived... it
all means nothing.... and it does not
matter......
