WHAT of IT?

y(i£O\CE MORGENSTERN

“I should think,” some of the boys
ooccasinally says to me, “that you
would run out of ideas now and then
and find yourself without anything
to write about.” To which I return,
feeling utterly at peace with myself
and the world, “Oh, no. Such are
the workings of that great mind
which beats above these eyebrows
you see before you that the What
Of It? column of The Daily Maroon
shall never find itself, like the Rio
Grande river in the summer, run
dry.” And I beam upon him, and
go on my way My confidence in my-
self has frequently been reassuring
(to myself), for some days DO come
when there is, apparently, a dearth
of ideas lying about. Somehow or
other I manage to struggle through,
however; I am hoping for the best
today. Let’s see. . . .eleven lines. . . .

* * ♦ *

My esteemed friend, Terrible
Turk of the Whistle, has voiced the
sentiment of all those who fall un-
der the classification “senior” in his
cry for action making it legal and
no cause for mob violence if fourth
year men appear on the campus with
canes. He feels, and the senior class
with him, that when a man is a
senior, he ought to be set apart from
the herd by some distinguishing
mark. Under the present state of
affairs, seniors are not so distin-
guished. Frequently they are crowd-
ed out of the senior table over at
their frat-clubs by freshmen; it is
a common occurence to see them
wandering about the campus with a
lost look on their faces, as if there
were no apparent cause why they
should be around, or even alive. All
this I feel from the bottom of a hu-
manitarian heart, is not as it should
be. I shall some day, I reflect, be a
sen Or, too, and I know I would not
have it thus.

•	*	♦	♦

What more appropriate way of
helping the senior out of his slough
of despond than to allow him—nay,
to decree that it is his inalienable
right, his and no other’s—to sport
a cane about the campus (and any-
where else he wants, provided he has
the nerve)? For doth not Shakes-
peare say:

“When I reach manhood,

I shall take the garb of a man.”
Huh, doesn’t he? A cane should
certainly count as an essential part
of such costume. As for its being a
fit symbol to distinguish the senior,
doesn’t any egg with a cane stand
out from the crowd?.

* ♦ * ♦

While on the crusading bent, I
might as well let out a ringing call
for more lights in Harper Library.
The existing lighting system is
enough to bring tears to the eyes of
Upton Sinclair, who once favored the
dear old school with several para-
graphs in “The Goose Step” on the
nice little diamond-paned Gothic
windows that looked so nice in the
chemistry building. As things are,
there are only about four tables in
the big Harper reading room that one
can see at.

•	* * *

Of course, it may be argued that
the lighting situation, for the pur-
poses which the library has always
been employed, is entirely all right
just as it is. It may be argued that
I am taking a kick at one of the
most precious props of student privi-
lege. Some one, no doubt, will sar-
castically ask whether I.do not favor
installing dictaphones under the ta-
bles. To all of this I reply that I
am merely out disinterestedly seek-
ing to clear up such evils as seem
to hamper the great work, if any,
being carried on by Dr. Dorf and the
university. And, as I have not been
near Harper for a year and possibly
won’t be for another one, it will not
bother me' greatly if the boys and
girls are exposed, for I am not of
them,	1

Address Meeting

With Vice-president Charles G.
Dawes as the leading speaker of the
meeting, the Third Public Confer-
ence on Education and Industry was
held yesterday at Mandel hall. Mr.
Dawes introduced Dwight W. Mor-
row of J. P. Morgan and company,
the first speaker of the afternoon

The vice-president proved to be in
an excellent mood and his talk kept
the large audience laughing through-
out. It was not so much what he
said but the manner in which he said
it that was responsible for the suc-
cess of his speech.

Dawe# Laud* Morrow

Mr. Dawes’ introduction did, how-
ever, contain some facts about Mr.
Morrow not generally known. He
revealed that Mr. Morrow had recent-
ly declined the presidency of Am-
herst College, and later on spoke
highly of his work as a member of
the General Staff of the American
Expeditionary Force.

Five Industrie* Represented

In all, five great American indus-
tries were represented during the
conference. In the morning session
presided over by Max Mason, presi-
dent of the University, W. S. Parish
discussed the oil industries, Ernest
R. Graham the building and con-
struction industries, and Edwin S.
Jordan the automobile industries. In
the afternoon, besides Mr. Morrow
who spoke on finance, Fred W. Sar-
gent described the transportation
problems.

Students Offered Cash for Essays
On ‘Place of Railroads in America’

Cap and Gown Photo Deadline
Nov. IS; Studio Lists Activities

Announcement was made today of
an opportunity -to students of the
University to win $50 to $150.

This news comes in an offer by the
Illinois Central to pay the above
mentioned sums for an essay on the
topic: “The Place of the Railroads in
the life of the American People.”
The essay must be between 700 and
1000 words in length, and must be
completed by November 30 at the
latest. For further information, pu-
pils may find mimeographed notices
over the campus.

The Illinois Central is holding this

Dash Ninety Miles
To See War God

Ninety miles in a Ford to see
forty million miles through a 40-
inch telescope.

That was the record established
Tuesday night by Wally William-
son, Milt Kreines, and Bill Steven-
son, when they packed into a Ford
coupe, and raced over the high-
way to Williams Bay, Wis., to
cover the “Mars story” for The
Daily Maroon.

Making the trip north in three
hours, the adventurers arrived in
time for the fireworks, saw all that
there was to see through the Yer-
kes observatory lens, and relayed
their impressions of the whole af-
fair to news editors waiting in the
Maroon office, for the story.

Getting lost and almost running
out of gas added to the excitement
of the return. The Maroon repre-
sentatives reached Chicago yester-
day morning at 6, making up their
lost sleep in their morning classes.

Sigma Nu Frosh
Defy Long Arm

Of Fratres ’ Law

When Sigma Nu Freshman decide
to eat lunch away from the fartern-
ity board, it takes two squads of po-
licemen to bring them home. Monday
noon, the pledges of Gamma Rho
chapter gathered en masse at the
Maroon lunch room to see if they
could find something besides hash
for their palates.

But to the fratres this seemed sac-
religious, and a hurry up call to the
police department declaring that a
riot had hit a campus lunchroom,
brought two squads of burly blue
coats to the scene, where nineteen
potential Sigma Nus peacefully
gnawed at their repast.

Puzzled, the police left the lunch-
room. Two minutes later the Sigma
Nu chapter swooped down upon the
neophytes and forced them through
a program of songs and stunts.

Aimless Footballs

For the first time in his football
career .Captain Wally Marks of
the Maroons had the opportunity
of throwing passes without worry-
ing about how they were going
to tome out on the other end.

Marks tossed two dozen brand
new pigskins into a crowd in front
of the Capitol theater yesterday
afternoon. From the roof of the
theater Marks aimed for the
heads of the people below and
missed not once, for each foot-
ball belonged to someone long
before it reached the ground. Fol-
lowing the outdoor spectacle, he
appeared on the stage of the thea-
tre, in conjunction with the show-
ing of “Red” Grange’s picture,
“One Minute to Play.”

HONOR COUNCIL
S EKS SUPPORT

Student Cooperation Goal
of Commissission

Student aid is being sought by the
University Honor commission to pro-
mote further cooperation in the ful-
fillment of its duties. The leaders in
the senior class are being approached
first and then the leaders in the other
classes for informal discussion to
bring forth constructive ideas on stu-
dent honesty.

The Commission is seeking inform-
ation from other schools all over the
country on other honor systems.
I Among the 100 schools written to
are Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Cal-
ifornia, Stanford and numerous eas-
tern, western, southern and Big Ten
schools. THe ultimate goal of the
Commission is first to promote both
sentiment and policy of honor in the
University, and secondly to try cases
involving honor that are brought be-
fore it.

Before Alumni at

La Salle

“The moment I doubt my mental
fitness, physical ability and under-
। standing of my job I am going to get
out. I do not think I have reached
that point.”

In these words Coach A. A. Stagg
assured the alumni of the University
assembled at the annual football ban-
quet held last night at the Hotel La-
Salle that he was far from through,
coaching powerful Maroon squads,
President Max Mason joined the oth-
er speakers of the evening in praising
the Coach and the team and together
with the “Old Man” predicted victory
in the Ohio game.

Beginning his speech with an ap-
preciation of President Mason’s great
interest in football, Coach Stagg
thanked the previous speakers for
their compliments. “It does not wor-
ry a man to have evil spoken of him
but he appreciates the good,” he
said.

Has High Hopes

The “Old ‘Man” concluded his
speech by saying that “While Pur-
due managed to march down the
field for a touchdown in the last
game, the Maroons will do the march-
ing next Saturday.” He then intro-
duced Wallie Marks who was greeted
with cheers.

FOR WOMEN

IN most of the universities and colleges throughout the country or-
• ganized sports for women have assumed a position of some im-
portance. Usually, the Women’s Athletic Association plays a prom-
inent role in campus activities. Coming to the University of Chicago
from another school, many newcomers are struck by the negligible
position held by the women’s organization here. The question is
raised: Why is this so?

Several explanations may be suggested, but first of all it must
be stated that lack of ability or interest on the part of the women
themselves is not the reason. Many of the most prominent women
on campus came to the University with a keen interest in sports and
with no little ability. In high schools and camps they had been
proud of this skill and glad for the enjoyment they derived from it.
Why, then, did this interest disappear so quickly?

DAVIS ’23 TO HEAD
NEW SYNCOPATORS

“Memph” Davis of city-wide fame
as premier concocter of hot jazz, is
back on the campus again, and may
be located over at the Kappa Sig
house.

“Memph” graduated with the class
of ’23, and was at that time a mem-
ber of the Phi Phi senior honorary
society. He was well known in cam-
pus circles, and his famous “Five
Maroons” gained such popularity that
they were given a contract to fur-
nish music on transpacific liners to
the Orient. “Memph” is planning to
organize a new four piece orchestra,
which he says, “will be hotter than
ever.”

Essentially because these women, sensitive as Freshmen, to all
university rites and standards, fearful of falling into social error,
found that women’s athletics are “not the thing.” With a justifiable
horror of the ‘ athletic woman” the men of the university had made
it clear that none such could rate with them. The clubs withdrew
from the athletic field and took their Freshmen with them. And so
after the required two years of physical culture the ranks of sport
candidates dwindle down to a small group of people who enjoy the !
play.

Mere participation in team play does not produce the masculine
athletic type of woman so deplored. Moreover, the women of the
university seem to have lost sight of the splendid opportunity for
social intercourse and social distinction that a thriving and alive
athletic organization would give them. Parties, spreads, dramatic
entertainments, as well as meetings and active participation in sport
makes it possible for girls to have a good time among themselves,
an accomplishment that the women of the University of Chicago do
not seem to have cultivated. The men, by offering their support in
the way of approval, encouragement and assistance when needed,
would prove themselves so much more to be men, having forsaken
school boy prejudices.

have efficient caretakers to keep down the unruly crop. Someone -
has said that a highly-efficient barber shop was one thing Chicago
needed. Why talk of new field houses and better stadiums when our
most poignant need is a bigger and better barber shop.

We need a new up-to-the-minute, sanitary barber shop. That
is imperative. The Reynolds Club is neither adequate or efficient.
Its reputation has long been shady. The nearest shop is seven blocks
away. Much valuable time is lost in going there. Of course the fastid-
ious man will walk a mile for a shave as well as a camel. But who
wants to. So let’s urge the barbers to give us an adequate, sanitary,
efficient shop near the seat of activities.

Yale-Harvard Game Precedes
Illini Homecoming

Contest

This year’s presentation of the an-
nual Yale-Harvard football game be-
tween two freshman teams will come
on the Friday aft moon preceding
the Illinois-Chicago game. The game
is to be played either on Stagg Field
or on the field at 56th and Green-
wood recently christened Crisler
F^ld.

The Yale team is being coached by
Jerry Fisher and the Harvard men-
tor is Coach Huntington. In previous
years Harvard has been led by A. A.
Stagg Jr. The Yale team is out for
revenge this year and Fisher swears
to wipe out the memory of the defeat
by Harvard in the last fray.

Blue ▼*. Scarlet

The squad is now being divided
into two parts, one part to wear blue,
the other scarlet. The coaches will
soon start giving their teams plays
and the battle will be on. One team
will probably use Illinois plays while
th? other outfit will be playing Ohio
State and Northwest formations.

In former years this interesting
hattie has been a postseason attrac-
tion, coming on the first Wednesday
following the varsity scrap with Wis-
consin. It has been scheduled earlier
this year to add to the home-coming
program for the Illinois game,

are all set for today’s battle.

Campus Terrors,
Cardinals, Win In
Non<-Greek Games

The Club Leujue started out their
touchball season yesterday afternoon
the Cardinals defeating the Macs six
to nothing. The victors displayed
wonderful form in downing the
Macs, one of last year’s strongest
teams. A pass from Maneatz to
Page to Saltzman, followed by a long
and spectacular run, scored the win-
ning points.

The Campus Terrors and the Ro-
mans fought to an ignominious tie.
The first half of the game these two
teams were evenly matched and most
of the pl ying was in the center of
the field. The second half was fea-
tured by long and spectacular gains
made by both teams but neither were
able to invade the goal zones. This
was an extremely hard fought game
and had to go into an extra period
which still resulted in a tie.

The horseshoe results for yester-
day were as follows:

Sigma Nu won by forfeit from Al-
pha Sigma Phi; Phi Gamma Delta
2; Tau Sigma Omicron 0; Tau Kap-
pa Epsilon 2; Acacia 0; Pi Lambda

Pennsylvania will invade Illinois

year. Johns Hopkins scored a touch-
down, while Franklin and Marshall,
Swarthmore, Chicago and Williams
failed to score.

I-M INKLINGS

The Intramural Council had a big
meeting and banquet at Commons
Club Tuesday evening. Over forty
organizations were represented by
their leaders. The renowned Dr. Mo-
lander presided and ran the meeting
off in the energetic style for which
he is noted. General Manager John
Howe, appointed three committees.
Committee on Rules; Lafayette
Marsh, chairman, Carnivals and
Awards Committee; Paul Holinger,
chairman, and Touchball Committee;
Leonard Gray, chairman.

The fears of campus pessimists
that fewer and fewer athletes were
coming to the university are all set
to rest and disproved by the latest
set of football facts from the athlet-
ic department.

This year’s football tournout is
breaking all previous records at Chi-
cago. More men are playing the
game on Stagg Field than ever be-
fore in the history of the University.
At present the two fields are filled
each night with the forty-eight var-
sity men and the eighty six fresh-
men that are candidates for the
teams. The turn-out at the beginn-
ing of the current season included
fifty-six varsity gridders and 124
freshmen.

The number of the major team
men that have stayed out for prac-
tice week after week is not quite as
large as last year but the total num-
ber of yearlings on the same basis is
larger by nearly one-third.

On account of this increase, plans
are now under way for the enlarge-
ment of the locker room in the base-
ment of Bartlett. At present the old
room is jammed full each night.

Play Shows Improvement

Although it is still problematical
whether Anderson and McKinney,
fleet halfbacks, will get into next
Saturday’s game the Maroons pro-
ceeded to drill last night on the the-
ory that these players would not be
able to take the field against Ohio
State.

McKinney was in uniform but he
idd no active work. Anderson, who
played a strong game against Purdue,
spent his practice hours under the
care of Trainer Benson who is using
all his medicinal lore to get the half-
back into shape. Anderson’s both
knees are in poor condition.

Hoerger, end, is also being treated.
His ankle bothers him. It is doubt-
ful whether Stagg will risk playing
these men Saturday unless there is a
possibility of winning.

Drills On Passes

Stagg had a backfield composed of
McDonough, Libby, Marks, Leyers on
the offense behind a second string
line against the freshmen. Passing
was emphasized, federal new plays
being used. Marks, at halfback, did

the tossing in accurate style. Fulton
replaced McDonough alt intervals..
The first string line bucked against
the regular freshman team who were
on the offensive with State’s plays.

The Constructive Function

of Investment ‘Banking

w:

EA LTH is being accumulated in this coun-
try at an amazing rate. It is now estimated

in excess of 350 billions—an increase of about
50% in the last ten years. Meanwhile, savings
deposits have increased in even greater propor-
tion, and now exceed 23 billions of dollars.

The constructive function of investment bank-
ing is constantly to direct the flow of surplus
wealth back into productive channels where it
will be safeguarded for the investor while it is
used to finance business and industry, and create
more wealth.

There is a satisfying and profitable career in the
Investment Banking field for college men who
have sound economic training,combined with per-
sonal qualifications and the energy to master a busi-
ness that is as technical and, at the same time, as
humanly interesting,as other popular professions.

If you are interested in more complete infor-
mation about Investment Banking as a vocation -
its possibilities, its advantages, its requirements—
we shall be glad to send you informative literature.,

JUSTIFICATION

Perhaps it is true,
Not that 1 cared
Too much for you,
But that I dared
To live my love.

Yet surely the gods, if gods there be,
Will not be very harsh with me,
Knowing that 1, with laughter and
jest

Have really tried to best

My love. And if they remember all
the cost

That loving you has ever been,
Remember all 1 had and lost,
Surely they will not deem it such
great sin

That I have heard in time of need
A stronger call than that of creed.
Perhaps I have sinned; if that be
true

The sin has been in loving you.
—Peter Pan

OOOH! And Illinois is at it even
once again! Now it seems that they
are crying about the fact that our
University authorities are only al-
lowing them to have one hundred
men in their band. Don’t they think
that they are going to have enough
wind blowers there as it is?

TO A GIRL IN WINTER
Sweet girl, why do you shiver so?
You say you’re cold—and yet I know
That in your heart there burns a
glow

With warmth enough to melt this
snow.

Perhaps you saved this warmth for
me,

To last us through eternity.

Who knows but that it’s cold up
there,

And love is crude in frigid air.

But still, your clothes are so darn |
thin

No wonder sometimes you are glum; ‘

The wind cuts through you like a |
knife,

My dear, you’re beautiful . . but
Numb!

O. K. I know just the girl. .. .

Anyhow the party had started off;
the necessary cabareting had been
done; the inevitable parking accom-
plished. Suddenly he looked around
into the back of the car. “My dear,”
he asked, as he noted the pessimistic
expression of his gentleman pal,
“How come the girl friend, what’s the
matter?”
