WHAT OF

If there is any singing in order for
Mr. Stagg’s Maroons after what hap-
pened Saturday it will be “Old Hun-
dred” or something of a like nature—
Chopin's Death March, for instance.
Your correspondent was in Cham-
paign, in the heart of the enemy’s
country, when the sad news came in
from Penn. He had thought, before
that announcement, that, being where
he was, he had reached the lowest
depths of melancholy possible to at-
tain. But after the 27-0 verdict was
known, your cor-despondent realized
that there was unplumbed depths of
forlornness which he knew not be-
fore.

* ♦ * *

The happenings at Philadelphia
brought out the great truth of that
so-called heroic couplet which Mr.
Alexander Pope, an old Oxford grad,
wrote after seeing his rugby team bow
in ignominious defeat to Cambridge.
“A little football is a dangerous thing;
Either be good, or let alone the ding-
ding-ding.”

This obviously, from the angle of
pure style, is one of the poorest of-
ferings ever dished out from the Pope
ink-pot. But the message it conveys
is of so signal a truth that the verse
lives on through the ages. It is ap-
plicable, for example, to the Maroons.
They know, and can apply, just
enough football to pass for a team;
farther than that, it seems, they can-
not go. I shudder for the future. Per-
haps it would have been alt for the
best if the boys had not enlisted for
this fall, and would have confined their
activity to the house touchball team.

When one goes to Champaign, one
expects, having been brought up in
the orthodox fashion on “Town and
(iown” and “Fraternity Row,” a sort
of Ralph Barbour story-book college
atmosphere The peculiar thing is that
he gets just that in the Twin Cities.
The place was decked up in miles of
orange and blue tissue paper and bunt-
ing (it being Homecoming) Satur-
day when I drifted in casually. There
was a Clown Parade, in which it was
difficult to tell who were marchers,
and who onlookers—so true does the
type run down at the Greatest State
University There were Homecoming
banquets with speeches, several of
which I attended. There were copious
amounts of singing, rah-rah, and
hicks. In short, children, it’s all just
li^e you imagine it at Illinois.

* * * *

In the course of the day, I saw
a football game, concerning two out-
fits of hog-butchers goin*g under the
name of Illinois and Iowa. Either
team. I am afraid, could beat us by
tb.ree touchdowns, Illinois, being on
<>ur schedule three weeks from now,
probably will. It is a horrible thought.
I merely suggest it as a possibility
at this time to prevent floods of un-
expected anguish gushing over the
campus the night pf November 6. My
theory- is that if the boys and girls
hereabouts have their cry now, they
can look forward to the impending
conflict with fortitude—yea! aqd even
with unconcern.

After all, I suppose, we can take
refuge in that oft-repeated sentiment
heard at the Alumni banquets: “It
doesn’t much matter if we win or lose
—it’s the GAME, the developing of
MEN that count.” The dreadful
thought occurs to me that Maroon
football player*, brought up in the
tradition of taking them on the chin,
may go out into “the game of life”
expecting, and getting, them always
on the button. Hence, all nice sen-
timents to the contrary. I think it
might be just as well if the Maroons
were to win a game now and then.

ing, and arranging of the newly ar-
rived collection of Egyptian speci-
mens.

This collection is related to the daily
life and burial customs of the Egyp-
tians. It has in it such articles, as
limestone grave statuettes, pressed
flowers, building materials, a plaster
cross-section of a pyramid, and a bur-

Daily News Will
Present Battalion

With New Banner

Some time in the spring of the pres-
ent academic year the R. O. T. C. will
receive from the Chicago Daily News
a new Batallion banner.

The standard will be made of red
silk to represent the local division of
fielu artillery. It is probable that it
will bear the coat of arms of the
University embroidered upon it. It
will be similar to the official standard
used to represent the field artillery
throughout the army.

A ceremonial presentation of the
banner is being planned by the R. O.
T. C. and the Chicago Daily News.

At Initial Dance
Of Season

Walter Ford’s orchestra, which 'is
now relieving Del Lampe at the Tri-
anon, will play for the Pledge Dance
given on October 29th by Score Club
and Skull and Crescent. This orches-
tra was selected, according to Rob-
ert Harman, president of Score Club
and manager of the dance, because of
the wide-spread reputation it enjoys
and of its experience in playing tor
large crowds.

Hotel Cooperates

The Shoreland hotel, chosen for the
dance, is cooperating with the man-
agers to asure every possible con-
venience for the guests, including ad-
equate checking facilities, and the use
of the entire second floor, Harman
asserts.

Tickets are now on sale and can
be procured through the fraternities.

Issue Directory of

Resident Students’ ‘
Names, Addresses

As a result of a vigorous demand
on the part of members of the Uni-
versity, a student’s directory is to be
issued early this quarter containing
the name, address, and telephone
number of every student in residence.
To insure perfect legibility the direc-
tory will be typed and not mimeo-
graphed. Copies will be available in
the office of the graduate schools and
dean of colleges, director of activities,
chairman of the Women's council, the
bureau of records and the information
office. These copies are placed for
the use of the students and faculty,
and will be revised quarterly.

The student’s directory is a result
of a canvass of the question made by
a committee of which David H. Stev-
ens is chairman.

Many fathers who live in Chicago tel-
ephoned their acceptance.

the definite promise yesterday of
President Max Mason and Coach
Alonzo A. Stagg to speak at the din-
ner for fathers Saturday night.

EMBRYO ORATORS
FIGHT FOR OFFICE

Future Henry Clays and Daniel
Websters came to light yesterday at
the first meeting of the somewhat
ambiguous Freshman Forum. Despite
the fact that there was only one man
fitted for the job (according to each
of the five candidates for president),
slightly more than an hour was con-
sumed in determining whom he should
be. And no one was elected.

- The Forum is primarily for debat-
ing and discussion, and from the na-
ture of yesterday’s meeting, this year
should be a banner one. The Forum
will not assume its true functions,
however, until next meeting when the
officers will be elected, if this is pos-
sible.

Westminister Club

Operatic and movie music will be

Westminister club meets for the first
time this quarter tonight at 8 in the

terian students will be welcomed.

We’re beginning to believe that the
Score club and Skull and Crescent
dance is going to be one of the social
events of the season. It is being held
in the large ball-room of the new
Shoreland Hotel, and there will be
plenty of room for the large crowd
that is expected. The members of
these two • societies are trying to plan
decorations which will in some way
represent the women’s clubs; and, as
usual^ one dance will be dedicate^ to
each club. The order of these dances
will be reversed this year. The or-
chestra which has been playing at the
Trianon lately will furnish the music;
and there will be programs. Sounds

THIS FALL some four hundred freshman girls entered the Uni-
versity. ATI of them, we will wager, were enthusiastic, self-confi-
dent and interested in social as well as intellectual enterprise. Last
Sunday evening about one hundred and twenty-five of them learned
that they had made the social grade; that they had been bid to a
girl’s club. The other two hundred and seventy-five, now less en-
thusiastic, less self-confident, and suddenly most interested in in-
tellectual enterprise, surmised that they didn't rate.

There is no denying that here at the University membership
in a club definitely establishes a girl’s rating. Hiding the fact does
not make it easier for the non-club girls; they are keenly conscious of
it. The. fact presses them on all sides. We know of fraternities

which prohibit specifically any invitations of non-club girls to frat-
ernity parties; we know of many fraternities which prohibit such
invitations less specifically but just as surely by indirect pressure.
We know innumerable examples which illustrate quite finally the
fact that we have a caste system of social distinctions.

No amount of editorial writing is going to alter the situation
one jot. It is, and it has always been, an unavoidable part of the
student life at this and practically every other American university.
We can hope only to level those distinctions *n some small measure.

A calm examination of the standards which create the distinc-
tions is the best way we know to remedy the situation. We rec-
ommend that every person in school liberalize himself or herself
by such an analysis of the club and fraternity criteria of membership.
We think that those standards have little in them of the things which
make for underlying goodness in people.

AND WHY?

THE DAILY CARDINAL at the University of Wisconsin bemoans
in tones dt deep anguish the sheer disrespect its students show
for the great Eleventh Commandment of Father Volstead; the State
universities from Illinois to Michigan keep a doubtful eye on their
co-eds’ fingers for stains of the dread nicotine; the despondent col-
leges from Beloit to Albion guard the portals of their dormitories
with time-clocks and profuse excuse blanks for their adolescents,
who threaten to spend too many hours under the harvest moons;
the entire morality of undergraduates is besmirched and encrimson-
ed by rampant alarmists who seek to represent us as virtue in the
ebb. But at Chicago—and we hope it is not false pride that prompts
us—there are no Burns men shadowing Foster Hall, no monacled
spinsters eyeing fingertips, no voilent outbursts against campus
alcoholism. Not that the moral policy of University is apathetic,
but rather because there is no necessity for a moral policy. That
fact gives us reason to believe that our university is not only an
institution of higher learning but also an institution of higher morals.
Could it be possible to use this to demonstrate the antithetical theory
that “where there is brick-bat resraint there is reflex-laxity?”

Camels made cigarettes
the popular smoke

THROUGH sheer quality, through
a never before known smoking en-
joyment, Camels won the world to
cigarettes. Camel was the first and
only cigarette that combined all the
goodnesses of the choicest Turkish
and Domestic tobaccos, and Camel
became the greatest smoke word of
all ages. No tobacco name com-
pares with Camel.

Camel won and holds its over-
whelming preference through in-
domitable tobacco quality. Only the
choicest Turkish and Domestic

tobaccos are rolled into Camels.
These fine tobaccos receive the
skilful blending that only the
world’s largest tobacco organiza-
tion could give. Nothing is too
good or too expensive that will
make Camels, regardless of price,
the utmost in cigarettes.

If you have never yet tried
Camels, a new sensation in smok-
ing pleasure awaits you. The sen-
sation of the choicest, the most
perfectly blended tobaccos that
money can buy. Have a Camel!

WILL DEDICATE
MAROON STADIUM

Purdue Coining With Band
And Rooters

Saturday

La Fayette, Ind., Oct. 18.—A light
workout, which spiked members of
the team who had engaged in the
game with Wisconsin last Saturday,
was the first step this week in prepar-
ation 'for the 'Purdue-Chicago con-
test at Chicago next Saturday after-
noon. The Purdue-Chicago football
series is one of the oldest in the con-
ference and the middle west, and this
year has taken on special significance
because of the fact that it will dedi-
cate Chicago’s new stadium with its
seating capacity of about 50,000. a
number that is a far cry from the
bare handful of spectators who watch-
ed the first encounters between the

। Cross-Country Team
In Winning Form

A phenomenal-relay team and the
prospect of a championship for
next spring arc the heartening re-
ports that -are drifting from the
Bartlett training quarters as the
cross country harriers begin to get
into shape. The Old Man is per-
sonally directing the training this
fall not .because the team outlook is
so bright for this fall but because
there is the bright hope of building
a wonderfully strong relay outfit for
next spring.

With Burke, Williams, Hitz,
Hegovich and Jackson on hand to
work with this quarter and Jack
Cusack and several sophomores to
start on next quarter Coach Stagg
has some splendid material to work
with.

BADGER GAGERS
LOOK POWERFUL

INTEREST SHOWN
IN SECOND ROUND

OF HORSESHOES

two teams back in the early nineties.

Purdtie was successful in vanquish-
ing the Maroons in the first few
games played, but ft has been over
two decades now. not including the
war year of 1918, since Purdue has tri-
umphed over Stagg’s eleven. The
Boilermakers have come close and
last year went down to a fighting 6
to 0 defeat after staging a brilliant
forward passing game that was handi-
capped by a crippled running attack.
This year it is thought that Coach
Phelan’s offensive is somewhat strong-
er and his passing game is just as
effective as ever.

Many Sophomores

One of Purdue’s handicaps this
year has been the number of sopho-
mores on the team, but the new men
are rapidly gaining in experience. In-
juries have taken a toll, the tackles be-
ing particularly hard hit. First Ed.
Eickmann, a flashy sophomore tackle
suffered a badly injured leg and went
on crutches for several weeks and
then Herm Winkler, a 180 pound vet-
eran suffered a charley horse which
developed complications and ruled him
out for several weeks.

The annual football excursion will |
he run to Chicago and carry about 2,-
500 fans besides the Purdue military
band.

Coach Meanwell is sending his bas-
ketball squad through a stiff drill
three times a week in preparation for
the coming season which will open a
few weeks after the close of the foot-
ball game. An unusually large squad
is reporting to Meanwell regularly and
according to the opinion of many it is
a formidable looking group.

Many veterans of last year’s team
are with the squad and practically all
the frosh players of last season with
the exception’of those who are with
the football team. Captain Merkel,
Behr, Andrews, Nelson, and Harget,
are a few of the letter men who arc
with “Doc” at present. Hotchkiss and
Barrum, two regular veterans of last
season.

points they could get.

Many Perfect Records

Those to score their second vic-
tories yesterday and hold clear records
for the season are Beta Theta Pi. who
won from Phi Beta Delta: Phi Kappa
Sigma, who beat Psi Upsilon; Kappa
Sigma, winner over Chi Psi: Acacia

Delta Chi, by a forfeit from Phi Kap-
pa Psi; Phi Sigma Delta, victor over
Sigma Nu: Pi Lambda Phi, who won
from Sigma Alpha Epsilon; and Tau
Delta Phi, winners over the Alpha
Delt sextet.

Delta Sigs Win

Several teams experienced their first
victories of the tournaye, and put
themselves in the .500 column with one
loss and one win to their credit.
Among these were the Delta Sigs,
who won a close game from the strong
A- T. O. outfit. Phi Gamma Delta,
victor over the Dekes, Tau Sigma
Omricon, who took -a forfeit from
Sigma Chi; Phi Delta Theta, who beat
Delta Upsilon: Tau Kappa Epsilon, on
a forfeit from Delta Tau Delta and
Lambda Chi Alpha, also on a forfeit,
from Alpha Sigma Phi. One game—
the Zeta Beta Tau. Kappa Nu pairing
was postponed till a future date to be
announced later.

Early favorites who are looming up
in the close play are Delta Chi, Phi
Sigma Delta, Phi Kappa Sigma and
Beta Theta Pi. All of these aggrega-
tions have well rounded teams com-
posed of cool, consistent, finished, tos-
sers and succeed in placing the shoes
up near the stake at all times. Acacia,

OHIO STATE GETS
HUGE GATHERINGS

One million people have witnessed
Ohio State football games since 1916,
according to a set of statistics pub-
lished in the Ohio State Lantern. The
attendance has gradually been increas-
ing. In 1919 the largest crowd of the
year was twenty thousand while* when
Red Grange entered the Stadium one
November day last fall, over 85,500
people rose to greet him.

Ohio State in the last ten years has
won three championships, but during
the last four years the Buckeye team
has wo nno conference honors. The
school, 'however, is proud of the fact
that their stadium is the only one of
its type in the country. It covers 10
acres and is one third of a mile in
circumference. There are 81 entrances
and seven hundred ushers are required
to handle a capacity crowd.

“C” Club To Plan

Quarter’s Activities

With the purpose of outlining a
program for its activities this quarter,
“C” club will meet Tuesday at 4, in
the corrective gym in Ida Noyes hall,
according to Miss Blanche Hedeen,
president of the organization. The
meeting is also intended to serve as
a get-together affair for the members.

Women of the University are eligi-
ble to membership in “C” club when
they have made an Honor team.

Maroons To Contend With Galazy of Stars on Future
Opponent’s Teams; Coaches To Drive

.	Team Hard

What w’ill be the effect on the Ma-
roons of the 27-0 defeat administered
them by Pennsylvania Saturday? Will
the loss of this game by such a deci-
sive margin completely shatter their
morals and make them easy victims
for their future foes, or will the mem-
ory of Saturday’s debacle spur them
to fight only the harder? The psycho-
logical effect of Saturday’s defeat on
the young and impressionable Ma-
roons will be interesting to note

Big Ten Teams Strong

The Maroons have staring them in
the face the task of meeting five strong
conference teams: Purdue, Ohio State.
Illinois, Northwestern and Wisconsin,
on successive Saturdays. It will re-
qurie more than merely the correct
mental attitude to stave off the drives
and flashy runs of Wilcox and Koran-
sky of Purdue, Karlow. Marek, Eby
et al of Ofiio State, the Illini’s so-
called “four mules,” Baker and Lewis
of Northwestern, and Crofoot and
Harmon of Wisconsin. Mere psycho-
logy will hardly suffice to put the oval
over their opponents’ goal line. There
is not a case on record of a harmon-
ious high C tackling a runner on the
line of scrimmage.

The most discouraging feature of
Saturday’s game to Maroon followers
was the ineffective defense put up by
the Midway line to the onslaughts of
Penn’s backs. This fact could be
partly explained by the exceedingly
tricky offense of the easterners, but
there was nothing baffling about the
Penn defense which caused the Quak-
ers to break through often and tac-
kle the Maroon backs before they
could get started.

Maroon Offensive Weak

The new Maroon attack met its
first real test and collapsed. The for-

ward passes lacked deception, and
well-meant end runs failed to materi-
alize. But it would be foolish to re-
vert to the old line-plunging attack
of former years. The team is not
strong and powerful enough for this.
Considerable brushing up on open
plany and the addition of deception
should be in order.

The Maroons will face some mote
foxy business next Saturday when
they meet Phelan’s Purdue team.
Wisconsin could not defeat them, and
the Maroons should he troubled plenty.
If the Maroon line will be able to out
charge the weaker Purdue forward
wall, Stagg’s men should nip the
Purdue attack before it is well started.

Hard Drill Last Night

The humbled Maroons turned out
for practice last night, and again the
linemen received their share of atten-
tion. The squad was pretty welt
bruised up, but should be in condition
Saturday to open the conference sea-
son. Hoerger has a bad ankle and is
hobbling around on crutches.

A scrimmage began the week of m
tensive drill. Scrimmages are also due
tonight and tomorrow night for the
coaches are of the opinion that only
loads of work will overcome the glar-
ing weaknesses exhibited against
Penn.

D’YE remember last year when,
with a naive disregard of copyright
laws, the Whistle invited everybody
to send in bits of farorite poetry and
prose for column reproduction? Well,
we’ve got the fever again....the oth-
er night we happened on this bit from
The Teak Forest out of India’s Love
Lyrics:

"For this is Wisdom; to love, to live
To take what Fate, or the Gods, may

give.

To ask no questions, to make no
prayer.

To kiss the lips and caress the hair,
Speed passion’s ebb as you greet its
flow,—

To have,—to hold,—and,— in time,—
let go!

NINE typographical mistakes in
last Friday’s column. As the years
pass, however, we are beginning to
view these matters with something of
a philosophy. After all, it gives the
editor free rein and a ready alibi in
the spelling of such desirable, and
hitherto impossible, words as “peris-
picassidy,” “obbstrupperus,” and “ub-
iquitiousish,” and the other tough ones
including, “Personal Property I.”

METAMORPHOSIS

She was just a college freshman;

She had just a college freshman;

She had yet to rate a date—

She was rather cute to look on.
But ’twas doubtful how she’d rate.
Then arrived the day of pledging
I grant you it sounds mean,
But one trinket on her dress front
Makes her status: “Pretty keen!”
