^FLORIDA HURRICANE IS HERE

k^iw^ MAROONS THE HEAVIER OF TWO GREEN TEAMS

It is an open secret that those
pilgrimages with the football team
that have ever been the delight of the
college boys, here and elsewhere, are
soon to be no more. So much water-
marked paper bearing the great seal
of the University and the sign:man-
ual of the Dean, indeed, has been
circulating around recently on the
subject that there is scarcely any
doubt left about it. Vice President
Woodward and Mr. O’Hara, who only
issue statements when times of great
stress are come, have already issued
them on this, despite the fact that
the rumor that the gridiron caval-
cades are to die an unnatural death
is but two days old. That fact, me
thinks, just about dispels any hope
that the authorities are not regarding
the matter seriously, and have no
intention of bringing things to a
head.

* * • •

Chicago has never been synony-
mous with the “college life” atmos-
phere of Siwash and Champaign.
Some attribute this to the fact that
Chicago men see the lie in things—
and seeing it, put this “hell of a
time” college business down as hick
stuff. I have never been of this opin-
ion. I think Chicago men yearn for
it just as much as any pseudo-slicker
at the Greatest State University. I
have seen Chicago collegians, tem-
porarily transplanted to the stamp-
ing grounds of the enemy in Cham-
paign and Urbana, looking wistfully
over their shoulders as they plodded
forlornly toward the depot, watching
eagerly for the last glimpse of col-
lege spirit rampant, receding ever
more into the dusk as they neared
their trains.

*	*	* *

Even I, who have ever been sin-
gularly unconcerned with Joe Col-
lege and his multitudinous mani-
festations, have .felt, as the boys
say, my heart leap and my pulse
quicken at times under stress of this
spirit of which I speak. I have at
times, I admit, envied the simple
fellows who act “college” and are
happy in it down at Champaign.
They may be goofs, but I have
reached the conclusion that they get)
the most joy out of life—simply be-
cause they don’t know better. I
sometimes, as I say, would like to be
of them, despite their obvious fail-
ings. So would lots more of us here
beneath these drab towers and the
frey, hazy autumn sky.

•	* * *

Moved by this yearning for a “col-
lege life” that’s at just about every
college but this, we have, now and
then, broken out in manifestations
of enthusiasm over dear old Alma
Mater and the eleven staunch de-
fenders of the faith going out Satur-
day afternoons to do or die for the
cause, if any. We have sung the old
songs—those forlorn combinations of
sharps and flats that are all we have
in the way of hymns of hope and
victory—the band, mustered out
from the warmth of the house grate,
has piped its thin notes with fingers
blue with cold. We have done these
things; we have cheered Mr. Stagg
and the boys on at pep sessions, we
have marched with the team to the
train—Yea! some of us have even
gone along with the boys.

•	* * *

Certainly our sporadic outbursts
have been harmless. If ever a col-
lege pep session has been 99.6 per
cent pure, ours have been. If ever
the exhibitions of “spirit” put on by
the collegians accompanying the
team have been safe, and lukewarm-
ly anaemic, those of our men have
been so. And yet, the authorities

According to him the only injuries

which has healed, and Stickney’s leg

What! No Raincoat? Yes, Stagg
Field has no raincoat such as Ohio
State, Illinois, Pennsylvania boast
of, but what of it? Chicago’s won-
derful playing field, one of the fin-
est in the country has no raincoat
because it needs no raincoat. Thou-
sands of dollars have been spent
on special gravel, turf, grass seed
and tile to make the drainage sys-
tem perfect, and it is so perfect that
the problem at Stagg Field is one of
keeping the gridiron watered rath-
er than drained.

‘THE OLD MAN’

STAGGMEN GIVEN EDGE .
IN SCRIBE’S PREDICTION

OF CLOSE 1926 OPENER

By Victor Roterus

The University of Florida football
team bubbled with pep and ginger
when they worked out on Stagg field
yesterday afternoon. The visitors dis-
played unusual snap in their signal
practice, marking each play with two
concerted shouts which echoed to the
skies. “Breezy” was the word with
which one spectator characterized
them, but he got no laugh for he was
in a group of real estate men.

Although a number of ponderous
gents were included in Florida’s ros-
ter of twenty-seven men the coaches
declared that only one starting player
would weigh over 200, and that was
tackle Davis. The starting linemen,
including Davis, would average 175
pounds according to the ’Gater coaches
but these were not butcher’s pounds
as the writer’s eyes saw it. The back-
field averaged 160 pounds according
to Coach Sebring.

Saara and Bishop Star

A number of the players were in-
itiated into collegiate football only
last week against Southern so that
the team is lacking in experience. Cap-
tain Saara, center, and Bishop, full-
back, are two veterans who are the
visitor’s strongest bets. Both spark-
led in Florida’s sensational game with
Washington and Lee last year when
Florida overcame a ten-point lead to
win 17-14. Not a man on the squad
is in .his third year of service.

The team, despite its greeness had
a fair season in 1925 losing only to
Georgia Tech and the powerful Ala-
bama eleven. They opened the 1926
season last week with a 16-0 victory
over Southern by playing straight
football. The new Maroon tackles
should have their hands and arms full
stopping the crushing off-tackle drives
which feature the visitor’s attack.

It looks like an ideal opening game
/or the Maroons—-not too dangerous
but still tough.

BIG TEN TEAMS
BEGINSEASON

All But Purdue Slated
To Win Openers

All of the Big Ten football ma-
chines will wheel into action today,
and all of them with the exception of
Purdure are more than likely to
emerge from their premieres victori-
ous.

The Boilermakers aie slated to tac-
kle the Navy gridders at Annapolis in
a game which will mark the debut of
Bill Ingram as the midshipmen’s
coach. Purdue, under Phelan, has de-
veloped a baffling aerial attack, but
it is doubtful if their passing game
will be functioning perfectly this early
in the season.

The work of Capt. Baker of North-
western will be closely watched at
Evanston where the Purple warriors
clash with the South Dakota outfit.
"Moon” was of little value last sea-
son after Elmer Lampe crashed into
him in the Maroon-Purple fracas on
Stagg Field last autumn.

Fans Watch Page

“Pat” Page, who amassed an en-
viable record at Butler after leaving
the Midway, and is now at Indiana,
leads his pupils against DePauw this
aftenioon. A stiff workout is assured
the lads from Bloomington.

The Michigan gridders meet the
Oklahoma Aggies at Ann Arbor, and
will make as many points as Yost
wants them to make.

The work of Zuppke’s sophomore
flashes will be under close scrutiny of
rival scouts as the Illini swing into ac-
tion against Coe at Urbana.

ing a powerful aggregation at Minne-

YEARLING FOOTBALL
MEN REPORT EARLY

Monday afternoon the whistle will
blow for the official start of Fresh-
man football practice. Eighty-eight
yearlings have already reported for
work and have received their uni-
forms. Many former high school play-
ers are to be found in this squad, and
they, are expeeted to develop into
good material for next year’s varsity.

Coaches A. A. Stagg, Jr., Dr. Hut-
chinson, and Fisher are in charge of
the Freshman squad and they are
looking forward to the next few weeks
which they expect will show just
what good material this year’s large
and heavy squad of Freshman con-
tains.

New Midway Machine
Faces Big Intersec-
tional Test

By Milton S. Mayer

A crowd—a cheer—a whistle—a
crash—and the 1926 football season
begins.	•

That the new Stagg field will be in-
itiated with no runaway football game
is evinced by the records of the two
schools, by the venerable pasts of the
two coaches, and by the material and
condition of the two teams. The
Orange and Blue, carrying the stand-
ards of the southland and still smart-
ing from their last intersectional con-
test in 1924 when they bowed to the
Army, will do battle on a big scale,
although they are the lightest and
greenest team in Florida history.
Coach Stagg, with the conference
dopesters shaking their heads and the
grandstand wise men in despair, has
forty-five years of gore and glory to
uphold with an untried machine.

Rouse At Center

In both weight and experience the
Staggmen humble their adversaries.
The Maroon line tallies 184 pounds, as
compared with 182 pounds for the
front end of the Gators. Ken Rouse,
best and only pivot man on the Mid-
way squad, will swing the forward
wall with 178 pounds of weight and a
year of varsity experience. The only
sophomore letter man on last year’s
team, Rouse, has developed into an
A-l center, as A-l centers go.

Wolff and Neff at guard are both
veterans. The former, tipping the
scales at 195, is fast and tough, and
the latter, worn away to 235 pounds,
is expected to do the beef trust work.
Weislow, a sophomore, and Lewis, not
quite experienced enough to be a vet-
eran, are ambitious and big, ' and
should take some mighty jolts before
the evening shadow’s fall.

Apitz on the left wing is a safe
defensive man, good blocker, and will
be on the far end of more than one

“Meet the Boys ”—First Installment
of “Who’s Who on Midway Team ”

ponents fore and aft. Marks is a hard
runner and a clever dodger and his
opponents will find him hard to down
On defense he is a powerful asset to
the Chicago team and Chicago lines
need not worry when Marks is there
to back them up. Marks is a long for-
ward passer and a fair kicker.

Off campus as well as on campus,
Marks is a leader. He is one of the
eight curly-headed blondes on the
squad and one of the handsomest
players in the Big Ten.

The Daily Maroon and A. A. Stagg
Jr., co-operatively, present the campus
,sport fan with some thing new in the
annals of local sport publication. It
is, namely, a “Who’s Who” of all the
members and aspirants to membership
of the U. of C. grid team. The pro-
fessed object being the presentation
of the cold dope on each individual
player so that the campus fan may
come to know his pedestaled god, the
pigskin star, more intimately. Because
of the lengthy nature of the series it
will be necessary to run a sort of
continued story giving the full dope
on only a few men in each issue.

Today we present—

Captain Walter Emil Marks

Wally Marks, a member of Sigma
Nu fraternity, numbers among the
best backs in the Big Ten. Played
football for four years at Lindblom
High School, in the backfield. As a
sophomore on the Maroon varsity
team he starred at full back but last
year was shifted to right half.

He is again playing fullback this
year and is expected to tear his op-|

Two of the world's greatest scient-
ists may meet in Chicago this win-
ter. And together, Dr. Albert Ein-
stein and Dr. Albert A. Michelson, the
latter of the University, may proceed
from here to California, where experi-
ments bearing on the former’s world
renowned theory of relativity are con-

ducted, it was learned at the Midway
institution today.

Dr Michelson stated that although
he had not been in direct communica-
tion with Dr. Einstein, he understood
that the report of the prospective visit
of Einstein to the United States is
correct, though contingent upon the
health of the European physicist. Dr.
Michelson further stated that he plans
to return to California at about the
time Dr. Einstein is expected here.

It was upon the Michelson-Morley

experiments of 1883 that Einstein is
said to have based his theory. Recent
similar experiments with different re-
sults by Prof. Dayton C. Miller of the

Case School

Cleveland are
variance with

of Applied Science at
interpreted as being at
the theory to some ex-

tent. So Dr. Michelson is planning a
repetition of the tests with improved
apparatus, and it appears possible that
Einstein may observe the process at
close range.

NO MORE PARADES

APPARENTLY the facultyis alarmed by the chronic hysteria,
commonly known as “rah-rahism,” which prevails at other
colleges. Anxious to prevent the tainting of our academic calm
and dignity with this disease, they have decreed that the football
team shall not be on the stage at pep sessions, that no migrations”
such as that to Philadelphia last fall shall occur in the future, that
such-and-such and such-and-such shall not take place again.

The intentions of the faculty are excellent. Rah-rahism” is
bad, and no sensible member of the University, no matter what his
position, wants to see any more of it here. But is it possible that the
methods of the faculty are wrong?

When the football team goes to Philadelphia this year students
will accompany them, all faculty dicta notwithstanding. No one can
prevent students slipping away for a quiet week end in the home
town or the country, and tickets, at higher prices will be purchased
by the students.

After all. University students are supposed to be men and wom-
en, not boys and girls. Either the faculty will have to re-define the
position of the undergraduates or recede from its present position.
If we are men and women we have more liberty of action than we
are now granted.

If the now common collegiate hysteria is to be kept out of the
University the undergraduates will do it and nobody else. (Or is
the faculty about to set a style of haircut for all students?)

Staging a final effort to have a good
time before the onslaught of merciless
college profs begins, the great major-
ity of the 800 freshman registered in
the University will attend their first
football game at Stagg Field this if-
ternoon in the role of official rooters.

After a week of feverish rushing
around, endless luncheons, smokers,
and dinner^ a week of being lost in
mazes of corridors, gray buildings and
University atmosphere, the freshman
class as a whole finds itself a little
less green, a wee bit wiser in college
ways, and to themselves, seem a great
deal more sophisticated.

Rushing Continues

Although rushing does not officially
close until Oct. 10, the next week will
find it less reckless and probably not
as broad in scope as the first hectic
days. The results, of Freshman week
rushing are readily visible, and decor-
ative emblems on coat lapels have
reached a proportion which is more
than a mere sprinkling.

Freshmen women will officially
close their week’s program tonight at
Ida Noyes Hall with an informal get-
together. Clyde Keutzer of Black-
friar’s fame and Mrs. Charles Rob-
bins will lead the women in singing
of University sdhgs.

Green Caps Start

The men will begin their race for
membership in the Green Cap club at
noon Monday at the first of a series
of four luncheons to be held in Dis-
ciples of Christ Church. 57th and
University Avenue Although attend-
ance at the luncheons is not necessary
for eligibility to the club, directors ad-
vise all Freshman interested to be
present.

With the hemispheric*! integrator the illuminating engineer meaaurea light
intenaitiea and diatribution. These laboratory findings are piactically
applied to improve our everyday illumination.

'pHE ' ‘cheering situation,” one of those regularly recurring prob-
lems which rise up every year to confound the more progres-
sive and serious-minded portion of the undergraduate body, is with
us again. University of Chicago students, it seems, have never been
famous for the raucousness or the unanimity of their cheering. Some-
thing we say, should be done.

Here is a serious defect in our university. It is obvious to any-
one that one of the tests of a true university is the excellence of the
student cheering. The compilers of the College Blue Book, we are
sure, have spies at all the college football games, who rate the op-
posing student bodies according to the noises they make.

The University of Chicago, as we have intimated, has a very
poor rating. It is not a rah-rah school. The generality of its stu-
dents do not become enthusiastic upon the slightest provocation; they
do not respond automatically to the gesticulations of a cheer leader.
They have reserve, a critical attitude, dignity.

But they are also human beings. They have strong loyalties,
and they express those loyalties, under the stress of excitement, with
long and tumultuous shouting. But this shouting, we are proud to
say, has in it the enthusiasm of spontaneity.

There will always be a “cheering situation” at the University of
Chicago. And there will always be cheering. We think that if the
random shouting of the Chicago side of the field were unified more
thoroughly under the direction of the cheerleader, the cheers might
encourage the team to greater bursts of energy. The effect would also
be considerably more artistic. And we need not necessarily lose
the fine spontaneity which has alwasy characterized our cheering.

Can we do it?

Masons To Mix At

Acacia House Tues.

A smoker for all student Masons
will be held at the Acacia house Tues-
day, October 5th at 7:30 in the even-
ing. While plans are as yet rather in-
definite, an attempt will be mad j to
start reorganization of the Square
and Compass Club and a committee
is to be appointed for carrying this
out. Besides the actual business to be
considered, there will be an entertain-
ment also.

When the sun goes down

More than 350,000,000 incandescent lamps, with a
combined light of nine billion candlepower, make
city streets, stores, and homes brighter than ever
before.

The General Electric
Company is the world’s
largest manufacturer of
incandescent lamps. And
behind the G-E Mazda
lamps are vast research
laboratories dedicated
to cheaper and better
electric illumination, and
to the conservation of
eyesight.

A series of G-E adver-
tisements showing what
electricity is doing in
many fields will be sent
on request. Ask for
booklet GEK-1.

In bungalow or mansion, workshop or factory,
dormitory or auditorium, there is no excuse for
poor illumination. We have cheaper and better
lighting in the electric lamp than ever before; for
the dollar that bought 1,115 candlepower-hours of
light with the carbon-filament lamps of 1886,
now buys 16,200 candlepower-hours of light with
the Mazda lamps.

Not only more light, but correctly applied light, is
the order of the day. The electric lamp, with its
flameless yet highly concentrated light source,
lends itself ideally to reflectors, shades, and screens.
It is controlled light—safe light. And illumina-
tion becomes an exact science.

During college days and in after life, correct light-
ing must ever be of paramount importance to the
college man and woman. Good lighting is the
worthy handmaiden of culture and progress.

DARTMOUTH COACH

RELATES HOW HE

DEFEATED CHICAGO

Says Rythmic Unison Was
Responsible For
Touchdowns

Ponting out an example wherein
the champion Dartmouth football team
were forced to display the finer tech-
nique of the game, Jess Hawley, coach
of the eastern eleven, cited the famous
Dartmouth-Chicago game of last year.

“Lt was a perfectly timed team ad-
vancing in perfect rythm that netted
for Dartmouth the spectacular touch-
down in the Chicago game,” said Haw-
ley recently.

Score From Maroon Fumble

Dartmouth kicked off to Chicago.
Our ends, of course, went down with
the ball. A Chicago player tried for
it, but missed. The ball struck his
headgear and bounded toward Sage,
of Dartmouth.

"Now remember, every Dartmouth
player was acting in timed unison.
Sage saw the break, knew that if he
broke rhythm and tried for it, he

probably would recover the
Dartmouth, but he also knew
Dartmouth line was three

ball for
that the
or four
Captain

strides behind
Parker was in
with him. He
playing off if

him and that

unison and movement
would throw Parker’s
he broke unison. By

count, Sage continued his play, which
was to get his man out of the way
for Parker, so the latter could get the
ball and get away with it.

Parker Scores

Thus Sage gave up the opportunity
to grandstand. He got his man and
Parker picked up the ball and ran for
a touchdown—the most spectacular of
the game.

Les River Runs
Deep; Mate and
Advertising Man

An autobiography of Les River,
former editor of The Daily Maroon
would read like a fairy tale. In the
year that Les has been out of school
he has sailed the high seas, lived in
Greenwich Village, completed his first
novel, written sundry short, stories
and had a raise in wages from the
W. G. Bryan Organization of New
York.

From the campus to the crow’s nest
of a mighty freighter to the immacul-
ate blue of third mate is no little
achievement to a boy just past his
teens/ And to jump from rolling
boards to a mahogany desk in a crack
advertising organization is equally dif-
ficult.

We want to sound our praise of
Les now; now when his reputation as
an author is cherished by an intimate
few. We have read his novel. And
we know that it is safe in the hands
of Boni and Liveright, publishers. And
we also know that a very excellent
short story is appearing in a current
magazine.

There is no moral to this story. It
is just an account to let the friends of
Les know what he is doing; and to
recount our knowledge of our own Les.

LAMPE IN COACH’S
TOGS HIS ELEVEN
WINS INITIAL GAME

The Emerson High School team of
Gary, coached by Elmer Lampe, star
end at Chicago for three years, is
showing every indication of maintain-
ing its record of the past four years.
In the first game of the season, Emer-
son High overwhelmed the Muncie
team by a score of 41-0.

Lampe, who was a practically unan-
imous all-conference choice for end
while at the University of Chicago,
was called in to fill the vacancy at
Emerson when the previous coach
went to Michigan as an assistant on
Yost’s staff. As evidenced by the
Muncie score, Lampe’s charges art
continuing their performances of the
last four years when they either won
or tied for the Indiana championship
each year.

Wisconsin will hook up with Cor-

game should furnish Little with an op-

The Hawkeyes will open with Colo-

counter little difficulty in getting the

It has been our pleasure to serve generations of just such men as these in their
selection of clothes and accessories suiu.Je to their age and position.

Dick, of course, wears the Bowl—our model tor university men; Don wears the

here. He has the bachelor of arts de-
gree from Valparaiso university, and
a degree in pharmacy from the same
school. He was a bachelor of science
degree from Chicago. He has had ex
perience in teaching chemistry, coach-
ing major sports and serving as a
trainer at sanitariums.

This year he has enlarged and im-
proved the training quarters consider-
ably and has added new apparatus;

brains, punts, and passes ami has a
cool capacity for directing the field

(Continued from page 1)

Stanley Rouse is a senior weighing
178 pounds. He is a regular halfback
on the University of Chicago football
team for 1926. Rouse promises to be
one of the best running halfbacks in
the Big Ten this year. He is a con-
sistent ground gainer, very fast and
clever and as a punter of note. Crit-
erions in the Big Ten are paying high
praise to Straus’ work and it is ex-
pected that he will be one of Chicago's
biggest ground gainers this fall.

Rouse is a member of a football
family, his brother having starred for
the Maroons in 1917-1919-1920. In ad-
dition to being a punter Rouse is a
forward passer and a place kicker. He
will probably kick off for the Maroons.
He is a member of Delta Tau Delta.

Robert Leon Wolff

Wolff hails from Lake Forest, Il-
linois and played for three years at
Deerfield High school as right guard.
During his career at the Chicago hC
has stuck to the same key position
and through his long practise lias
reached a place where he knows prac-
tically all of the fine points of the
Jine game He is now twenty-one
years old and weighs 177 pounds. He
will probably be this season’s regular
right guard and will be a strong fac-
tor in the impregnability of the Ma-
roon forward wall. He is a member
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Lawrence Edward Apitz

Apitz, end, has his home in Bes-
semer, Michigan, and is twenty years
of age. He played two years of foot-
ball at his home prep school and is
-now playing left end at the University.
He is well over six feet in height thus
having the advantage of a long reach
up for the ball, making for an uncan-
ny east in snaring passes. His weight
is about 182 pounds and that and his
knowledge of the wing position fund-
amentals combine to make him one of
the most able of the conference ends.
Pledged to Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

John Kyle Anderson

John Kyle Anderson of Terre Haute,
Indiana, is a member of the Alpha Tau
Omega Fraternity. For two years he
played end and halfback at Garfield
High School in Terre Haute and has
been on the varsity for two years as
halfback. He is full of speed and the
necessary ground covering grit and is
an efficient man at twisting around on
end runs. He probably will start in
the first game of the season for al-
though he is light in weight he seems
to be always at the height of condi-
tion.
