Buggies and bicycles, those relics of by-

modern college woman as she is.

An Apollo cliorus will reflect campus

Durbrow, a former member of the Rohm
ballet, is directing and devising the

“We favor an ‘open’ Undergradu-
ate council, and endorse the policy
outlined in The Daily Maroon’s plat-
form.”

Candidates for membership on the
1927 undergraduate governing body
joined in protest against the recent
decision of the council to close their
meetings from the ears of The Daily

Universities are recognized by the
caliber of faculty members who re-
present them. This opinion, which
has been constantly reiterated by
prominent Americans in the field of
education for the past decade was
stated today by a Japanese who, des-
cending from a royal family of Nip-
pon, studied at Columbia and took
his doctor’s degree at the University

of California.

In a statement issued while
tending the Student Council on
temational Relations, he issued

at-

In-

doing so. The pro-
of its kind to be pro-
and its subject—the
one of universal in-

terest, according to Alta Cundy, produc-
tion manager. “It is a series of re-
flectiqns of the college woman—which
should combine to produce ample enter-
tainment.” Miss Gemdy continued.

It has been built up by University
students, and set to music by campus
artist;. The production aims to reflect
the cpliege woman not as she thinks
she i% but as she really is. She will be
revealed in song, in dance, in parody,
and >• picture.

An eleven piece orchestra composed
of catnpus women led by Marie Lewis
will play specialty numbers from the
stage, while a five piece men’s orchesfra
in the pit will accompany the Songs and
dances. Choruses composed nf campus
women will be led by Janet Good. Lois
Russell. Florence Schwab, and others.
Interpreting phases of modern life are
Ruth Atwell, Esthei Cook. Marjorie
Creighton. Ruth DeWitt, Eleanor Met-

EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
FASHIONS PLACED ON
EXHIBITION IN HARPER

Water colors and pen and ink
drawings illustrating the fashions of
the early and middle 18th century
have been placed on exhibit in
Harper W 31. The drawings are the
work of Miss Coma S. Sanlin, a south
side artist, and are copies of fash-
ions as they appeared in magazines
of that period.

A walking dress and evening gown
are represented as they were pub-
lished in a current magazine of
April, 1831. A gown of lavender
and yellow with the traditional “mut-
ton” pleeves, once so popular, has
been copied from a March issue of
1850. The bustle seemed to gain
specia) prominence as it appeared in
March^ November, and October num-
bers ip 1876. To present a contrast,
fashions of 1925 have been placed
with those of the 18th century.

PROFS. WRIGHT AND ■
CHARTERS TO START
SERIES OF LECTURES

Vital questions concerning domestic,
internal and international problems of
this country have prompted the. Univer-
sity to inaugurate a series of lectures,
treating subjects of interest and present-
ed by lecturers who have been chosen
because of ability to speak authoritative-
ly upon the topic selected. Two profes-
sors of the University, Dr. Quincy
Wright, of the political science depart-
ment ,and Dr. Werritt Wallace Charters
of the school of education will each
give a series of lectures commencing
March 4 and 7 respectively.

Prof. Wright spent last Summer in
Palestine, Mesopotamia, and Syria apd
the Autumn in Paris and Geneva. His
observances in the Near East will be
presented on Thursday, March 4 when
he will talk on “Relations with Unde-
veloped Peoples.” “Settlement of In-
ternational Disputes” will be his sub-
ject on March 11, and the following
Thursday he will discuss “Control of
Foreign Relation* in the United States.”

On March 7 Prof. c^ers will l^jJ
on “The Re-education of Parents;

March 14, on “Fr
pline”; and on Mai

i versus Disci-
, his topic will-

be “Friendship in the Home.” Dr.
Charters has lectured and written much
on the relations between children and

parents. ;

He spoke at great length of the valu-

who, by dint of their knowledge,
later assumed positions of import-
ance in American life.

“It is my opinion,” he said, “that
the personnel of the factulty of a
university is one of the greatest
points contributing to the Value of
that institution.” He went on to ex-
pkin from his experiences as a stu-
dent from a foreign land at Colum-
bia and California how through his
personal talks with certain profes-
sors he was able to obtain more In-
formation of real significance than

Romans to Adopt
Meeting Rules Of
John Locke’s Age

The spirit of John Locke and the at-
mosphere of the sixteenth century will
add to the meeting of the Romans called
today at 3 :30 in Reynolds club, Room A.

John Locke, philosopher, and student
of human nature, called his group to-
gether once each week for discussions
of philosophical subjects. The meetings
lasted for ten years, 16(10-70, and be-
came very popular. It was as a result
of these meetings that Locke wrote his
essay on “Human Understanding."

The Romans will follow religiously
John Locke’s rules which he set down
for his society. They will recreate the
rich old literatti meetings and philoso-
phical discourses.

These meetings, it is planned, are to
continue as a weekly occasion through-
out the remainder of the Winter quar-
ter and through the Spring quarters.
They will be given over to open dis-
cussions of a highly intellectual flavour.

STUDENT COUNCIL OF
DIVINITY SCHOOL TO
ENTERTAIN THURSDAY

All undergraduates taking courses in
the Divinity school and all executives for
the undergraduates have been invited
by the Student council of the Divinity
school to be guests at an afternoon tea
on Thursday, March 4 between 3:30 and
5:30 in the Social room of the Theology
building.

According to Frank G. Ward, social
chairman, the Student council is very
desirous that the use of the commodious
social room which has been placed at
his disposal $hould pot b^ restricted to

graduate students .but that ajl who haw
cla’sses in the buiTdmg might fee! free

through attendance
classes throughout
ester.

In conclusion, he

at the average
an entire sem-

made the state-

ment that he thought perhaps the
most satisfactory way to judge a
university from a practical view-
point was by the personnel of the
men who compose its faculty, rather
than by the size of its departments,
the number of undergraduates in at-
tendance, or the percentage of stu-
dents who attain to Phi Beta Kappa.

RUSHING DISCUSSION
HOLDS ATTENTION AT
FEDERATION MEETING

Discussion of a new Senior college
rushing system sponsored by Federa-
tion at an open council meeting held
last night from 7-8 in Ida Noyes hail
brought out the strong points for
and against the plan.

Strong points of the plan were
that it would be fairer to the greater
majority of women; that responsibil-
ity for the freshmen would be shifted
from the clubs to the board of wo-
men’s organizations; that pledging
would be on a friendship basis and
would not be relied upon to be the
basis of the friendship; that clubs
would gain a prestige because of
picking prominent women; and that
opportunities would be equalized. It
was agreed that the present ten day
rushing system was very poor.

Points against it were that clubs
were of the most good during the
first two years, and that Senior col-
lege clubs would probably not mean

as much to the individual.

I

...

Y. W. C. A. pledged which were made
last quarter may be paid today, tomor-
row and Friday from 12 to 1 at the

the tea tomorrow afternoon is to pro-

vide an opportunity for undergraduates,
graduates and faculty to cultivate per-
sonal relationships that lead to coopera-
tion tii the classroom and on campus.

ing for two seats in the group, while
only three women, Marjorie Cooper,
Esther Cook, and Ruth Burtis, have
been nominated for the feminine
jobs. All of them voted support of
The Daily Maroon’s platform, de-
claring their intention to support the
open council policy.

Hitz Agrees With Maroon

T think we are expressing the sen-
timents of the Junior class” declared
Gifford Hitz, one of the condidates.
“Since the council is, in the ultimate
analysis, only the voice of the stu-
dent body, their problems are the
students’ problems, and their dis-
cussions are the students’.”

Several other candidates were as
definite and determined in their;
sentiments. “The quibbling between j
The Daily Maroon and the Under-
graduate council has gone far
enough. Both organizations are too
important and too broad for such an
argument,” believes Marjorie Coop-
er. “The majority of undergraduates
have taken the side of The Daily
Maroon in believing that the council

is not absolute ruling body, but
merely an elective governing body,
subject, as all such bodies are, to
the wishes of the people.”

Reporter Will Attend

In accordance with a notice pub-
lished in last Thursday’s issue of this
publication, a reporter from The
Daily Maroon will attend this after-

THE DAY’S WORK

'T'HE Undergraduate council will meet this afternoon. A complete
•A- account of its meeting will appear in The Daily Maroon to-
morrow. /

The Daily Maroon can obtain such an account in only one way:
by sending a reporter to cover the meeting. A reporter’s job is to
understand what he sees and hears, and to make others understand
it. He must analyze and organize. Many of The Daily Maroon’s
reporters perform this job well; they have learned to observe accur-
ately, and to write clearly what they observe. The job to be done,
then is a public account of the proceedings of the undergraduate
council; the men best fitted to do the job are the Maroon reporters.

Therefore, a reporter from The Daily Maroon will be present at
today's meetings, and will write an account of the happenings at that
meeting.

GOPHER GAME MARKS SEASON’S FINISH

SPEED FEATURES
OPENING DAY OF
WINTER CARNIVAL

Many Qualify; Finals Will
Be Run Off Thursday
Evening

Bartlett Gymnasium resembled an
Olympic-land in the miniature yesterday
afternoon, when over two hundred Ma-
roon Track aspirants assembled there to
engage in the qv Bfying races for the
Second Annual Indoor Athletic Carni-
val. As a result of yesterday's contests
only the cream of the competition re-
mains for the finals Thursday night,
when the Intramural Department is to
stage the Grand Climax to their exten-
sive winter program.

Five men qualified in the 50 yd. dash
and five for the 50 yd. low hurdles.

In the dash, Schcrabul, Kappa Sigma,

and Laverty, Phi Psi, won their heats

in the same time (5:8), to tie for first
honors in that event. Gerhardt. Alpha
Dclt; Brandt, unattached, and Johnson,
Delta Chi were the other qualifiers tor
the dash. In the hurdle event the five
who qualified were Duval, Phi Kappa
Psi; Francis, Alpha Delta Phi; Scher-
abul, Kappa Sigma; and Peale, Phi
Kappa Psi.

Relay Race* Exciting

Most exciting or yesterday’s con-
tests were the relay races, which nar-
rowed down the teams to four in num-
ber. The four teams to qualify were
Phi Kappa Psi, Delta Sigma Phi, Kap-
pa Sigma, and Sigma Nu. About twenty
teams entered this event. The four qual-
ifying outfits made times which were
within a second’s variance, th." Delta
Sigs winning with 2:18 1 :10.

In the field events the competition was
carried to a finish, and points were
awarded the winners of the first three
places in each event. Duval, with a win-
ning heave in the shot put. and Koerber,
with the highest jump, sent the Phi
Psis and the Sigma Nus into a tie for
high point honors with five points each.
Krogh, Kappa Sigma, and Craft, Phi
Pi Phi, were the other point winners
in the shot put, which Duval won with
a mark of 4b ft., 10 1-2 inches. Ander-
son, Alpha Tau Omega, and Blanken-
stine, Phi Beta Delta, placed second and
third, respectively, in the high jump. The
pole vault is to lx: held Thursday night
in conjunction with the finals.

Looking over yesterday's results, four
teams stand out as probable winners of
the carnival. They are Sigma Nu, Phi
Psi (last year’s champs), Alpha Delta
Phi, and Kappa Sigma. However, with
many events to be held Thursday which
were not included in the preliminaries,
it is not safe to predict the favorites
from yesterday’s showing.

Begin Elimination
Handball Tourney

Starting today, an elimination
tournament in individual handball
run by the Intramural department
will be run off. Non-fraternity
men as well as fraternity men will
participate.

As each round is finished pair-
ings will be made until the final-
ists clash for the University cham-
pionship. The tourney will prob-
ably last for several weeks and
some fast matches are promised
before the finish.

The schedule will be posted on
the Intra-mural board every day.
For today eight are on the card:
Hudlin vs. Costigan, Jacobsen vs.
Taylor, Abrahamson vs. Ginsberg,
and Gleason vs. Elson at 4:15;
Bennett vs. Silberman, Johnson
vs. Greiman, Budlong vs. Juniper
and Gettleman vs. Vogel, at 5:00
o’clock.

Among these men are several
unattached and several other non-
fraternity men, members of the
Macs and the Romans.

WOMEN HAVE BUSY
WEEK IN ATHLETICS

This is to be a busy week in the
women’s athletic world as there are two
sets of basketball games, Inter-class and
inter-dorm, a swimming meet, and a

To those who are disposed to view
the present status of track athletics at
the University with a feeling akin to
alarm, I wish to point out a la Polly-
anna. that there is still a little ray of
sunshine on the horizon. I am referr-
ing to the noble hunch of runners who
delight the eye of Mr. Thomas Eck as
he scans his freshman team. To say
that it’s the best freshman team in a
long time is to understate matters, for
there are several prospects on it as good
as anything that ever came to the Mid-
way in the form of more or less raw
material.

Chicago next year can have either the
greatest two-mile or the greatest four-
mile team in the Conference. In the
two-mile there will be Jim Cusack, hold-
ing over from the varsity for his third
year of competition, who may be a con-
sistent 1 :55 man after two years of col
lege running. The freshman team of-
fers four 1 :59 prospects right now—
Dick Williams, Wake Burke, Virgil
Gist and Rudy Coles. Williams has
mopped up one race after another this
year, winning invariably in noble time.
Gist ran a 2:00 half the day after his
first night of Hell week a while back,
and that, under the circumstances, was
a considerable achievement. Burke has
broken two minutes at the same dis-
tance, although he never ran it before
this year, while Coles who won two
places in the middle distances at the
Stagg interscholastic last spring, ha*
also run under 2:00. If Chicago decides
to run those five in the two-mile relay,
the medals, watches, or what have you,
are as good as in their pockets now.

Maroons from running the two-mile re-

BOTH TEAMS ARE
OUT OF BIG TEN

CAGE TITLE RACE

Large Crowd to Attend the
Game; Gophers Out

to Repeat

By Victor Roterus

Minnesota will meet the Maroons
in a basketball game at Bartlett
tonight. And that’s about all that
might be said about it. There is
nothing of the significant or notable
to give color to the contest. There
will be no championship at stake, as
both teams have conceded their
chances of winning the title; and it
will not be a grudge battle, as the
, Gophers and Maroons don’t meet
। often enough in athletics for that

Capacity Game

Nevertheless the ancient gymna-
* suim will be most likely filled to a
| capacity, the teams will fight like
। mad, and the tension will be at a high
pitch. For that, dear readers, is the
difference between college and pro-
fessional sport.

However, the Maroons might have
an incentive due to the fact that it
is their season’s swan song. There's
something always tasty in being able
to say in years to come, “Yaa, we
topped off that season with a win.”
On the other hand, Coach Taylor will
do his best to inspire his basketeers
to greater efforts for the following
season. During his regime of the
past two seasons the North Star five
has not fared as well as it might
have. And also, during late years
the hiring and firing squad at Min-
nesota has been unusually active and
hasty. So victory over the Maroons
would be one good reason why Mr.
Taylor could unbashfully ask for his
job next year.

Rasey Is Brilliant

The spectators should delight in
the accomplished antics of one in-
dividual rather small of stature and
rather dark of hair when the game
is on tonight. His name is Rasey,
and he dribbles and plays in a way
fitting of a captain which he is.
Many’s the time when Taylor has
ruminated, “If I had five men like
that Rasey—.” Playing opposite
Rasey is Nydahl who is a sophomore
and, like his running mate, is not
overly large. At center Tuttle will
play in the place of the ill Wolden.
while Mason and “Red” Wheeler will
occupy the back court. This combi-
nation has won but two games this
season and lost six—five of them on
the road which broeds well for the
Maroons.

Oh yes, among the prominent and
loyal seated in the Gopher section to-
night will be Delton Waby and James
Dilley.

Present Conference Basketball
Season Is a Series of Upsets

Present Mr. Swift

With Jap Prints

Red Cunningham, captain of
the Maroon baseball team which
travelled to the Orient, presented
Harold Swift with several beauti-
ful Japanese prints yesterday af-
ternoon in behalf of his team-
mates. This gift, as Red said,
“ was given in appreciation of the
many things which Mr. Swift did
for the squad while it was away
on its trip.”

Throughout the long journey
Mr. Swift sent gifts of fruit and
candy to the team, after present-
ing them at their departure with
many gifts and his good wishes
for a fine voyage.

Last Sunday evening the first
pictures of the Japan trip were
shown to the public at the Del
Prado Hotel. They were viewed
with great interest by the as-
sembled group.

INITIATE BADGER

ACADEMY MEET

Madison, Wis., March 2.—An innovation
this year at Wisconsin is the First Na-
tional Academy Basketball Champion-
ship tournament, to be held March 18.
19 and 20 in the University Gymnasium.

Keen rivalry and good competition
have always characterized academy
athletics. There has been, however, no
method of deciding and declaring a na-
tional champion in basketball among
these schools. The University of Wis-
consin, therefore has taken the oppor-
tunity to organize such a tournament to
aid the academies in the annual decision
of a national champion.

The tourney will be modelled after
the National Interscholastic held yearly
at the University of Chicago, and which
will be run off this year at an early
date, in fact, within three weeks. How-
ever, only academics will be allowed to
participate.

The competition will be restricted to
men of academy status. This excludes
men who are taking junior college work,
but does not prohibit academies offering
junior college work from entering a
team, providing the school certifies that
the members of the team are bona-fide
academy students.

Tarpon initiation dinner scheduled to
take place. Tonight at 7:30 the inter-
hall finals will be played off and the
winner of the silver loving cup decided.

This is also a crucial time in the inter-
class cage tournament as the season is
drawing to a close and only one more
game remains besides this afternoon’s.
On Thursday at 4:30 the second of a
series of three swimming meets will
take place in which the four classes
will enter teams. The last meet was
won by the Sophomores, the Seniors
placing second, Freshmen third and
Juniors fourth.

From all indications there will he sev-
eral upsets in the class standings tomor-
row. Immediately following the swim-
ming meet, Tarpon will hold its initia-
tion dinner for all those who have suc-
ceeded in passing the tests requisite for
membership.

lay is the possibility that they would
make a better four-mile team. Cusack,
Conference mile champion last spring,
ran 4:23 3-5, while all the others ex-
cept Coles, who does not run over a
half, are even now, as freshmen, under
4:30. Williams ran 4:27 3-5 recently
in losing a close race to Egil Krogh,
former Maroon captain, Burke has run
4:28, indoors this winter, while Gist
ran 4:30 a year ago in high school.
There haven’t been a great many teams
in college track that have been able to
run the four-mile under eighteen min-
utes, but this will be one of them. With
all this as it is, my counsel to the de-
spendonet followers of Chicago track
at this time is to hold on to the ropes
for another year, for, as they say in
the movies, Messrs. Cusack, Williams,
Gist, Burke, and Coles herald the dawn
of a new day.

When the season is all over and
not until then will anyone be able
to say with any authority who will
have won the Big Ten conference
basketball race.

At the beginning of the year Pur-
due and Indiana were favored by
the alert sport followers and writers.
But Indiana began to lose and Pur-
due did not show championship cali-
ber. Michigan won a number of
games. Then the dopesters turned
toward the Ann Arbor quintet. “The
Dark Horse” it was termed. Ohio
State had its followers. All of a
sudden Wisconsin stock took a de-
cided bound. Here at last were the
coming champions. But the Madison
team was promptly licked a number
of times in succession, and the sea-
son was called “extremely hectic.”

Purdue Leads Now

Until Monday Illinois was the last
favorite. And on Monday eve the
downstaters were socked by the Boil-
ermakers, so now it is Purdue. The
only teams that cannot be taken into
consideration are Northwestern, Wis-
consin, Minnesota and the Maroons.
The rest of them are still in the
thick of the fight.

March 6 will havea great deal to
do in the way of deciding the cham-
pionship. On this date Indiana will
play at Illinois, and Purdue will make
its season’s final bow at Evanston
where they will play the Purple.
Should Purdue win that game they
will be assured of a tie for title
honors at least.

And So la Favored

At present it seems as if Purdue
and Indiana, slow in coming, are
travelling at the most consistent form
among the leaders. Ohio State will
probably be eliminated as they have
yet to play Michigan and Iowa, two
teams that are now tied with them
for second place.

A. T. 0. WINS WAY
TO FINAL GAME

IN I-M TOURNEY

Castle Runs High Score
as Zalla Is Held to

Four Points

By Jack Welty

In a brililant exhibition of basket-
ball Alpha Tau Omega defeated Phi
Sigma Delta in the last game of the
semi-finals by a score of 22 to 16 and
earned the right to play Sigma Nu
for the Intra-mural championship
Thursday night. Both teams played
good ball and six points was just
about the difference between them.

Castle Stars

The A. T. O.’s started off wtih a
rush and were never headed although
the score was tied on several in-
stances. Castle, brilliant center for
the winners and individual high
point man of the tourney, was the
big offensive star of the evening with
a total of 11 points. On two occa-
sions he dribbled the full length of
the floor to sink baskets. Gorden
and Anderson also played nice games
for the victors.

Preiss Stars

Preiss was the leading scorer of
the Phi Sigs with 8 points. Zolla,
stellar forward was held to two long
baskets by the leech-like A. T. O.
guarding.

Following are the high point

scorers:

Castle, A. T. 0.................. 28

Gorden, A. T. 0.................. 22
