Durand hospital last week with a case
of scarlet fever, is recovering rapidly,
according to the authorities at the hos-
pital.

Mr. Stevens' three children came
down with the illness at the same time
that he did. While Mrs. Stevens es-
caped the fever she is not entirely im-
mune from the sick bed as she. in
the mean time has contracted a severe
cas of the “flu" which has been general
throughout the city since te last of the
winter quarter.

Prof. Charles R. Baskewill, of the
English department, said that while
Projf. Stevens’ condition is grejatly
improved, he will not be able to take

WOMEN TO DISCUSS
FEDERATION POUCIES
AND PLANS TUESDAY

Criticisms and suggestions of Fed-
eration’s policies will be discussed at
the| open council meeting Tuesday
from 7 to 8 in the library of Ida Noyes
hall. “A Meeting On Meetings” is
the name chosen to explain the dis-
cussion. Representative women on
campus have been discussing the prob-
lem and offering their suggestions as
to improvements in the present sys-
tem at council meetings on Monday
noon. These suggestions will be uni-
fied into constructive plans at the
meeting.

’The Council has felt for some
time,” said Dorothy Kennedy, chair-
man of Federation, “that our aims
have not been clear enough to campus
in general. For this reason we have
planned the meeting.”

A reorganization of the Vocatioral
Guidance committee has also been

made.

This committee is to be re-

placed by the Committee-At-Large
which will take care of miscellaneous
affairs. The new committees will also
be in charge of the annual Fashion
Show

at 4 o’clock Monday afternoon in Rey-
nolds theatre. Selections will be
made by Hamilton Coleman, director,
as soon as possible in order that re-
hearsals may progress without inter-
ruption.

The music contest will follow the
first chorus rehearsal, which will be-
gin at 2:30 o’clock. All men expect-
ing to take part in the chorus are re-
quired to attend the rehearsal. The
large number needed for the chorus,
Mr. Coleman says, offer an exceptional
opportunity to aspirants to member-
ship in Blackfriars.

Competition for the music of four
principal lyrics was left open after the
first contest. These lyrics are “Please
Louise,” “Tag Along With Me,"
“We’re the Campus Women,” and the
opening chorus. In addition, Paul

Daniel Catton Rich, prominent in
undergraduate literary activities,

has written an

article on “Grand-

HOT TIME PROMISED
AT POLITICAL RALLY

IN HARPER TONIGHT

Red fire, a political band, and red
hot speakers will be the features of
an old fashion political meeting to be
held tonight at seven thirty in Harper
M-ll under the auspices of Under-
graduate Political Science club.

The informal political meeting is the
oldest and most frequently-used device
in conducting political campaigns, and
the Political Science club felt itself
obliged to acquaint the students with
it. according to Joseph M. Barron,
president of the Political Science club
and Deneen worker of the sixth ward.

No details that go to make up the*
old-fashion political meeting have
been spared to make this one resemble
it perfectly. There will be presented
there “all th hoakum that is politics
—all that goes to make politics a great
American sport,” says Mr. Barron.
The speakers will be Lewis J. Behan,
commissioner of the south parks; Ber-
nard W. Snow’, bailiff of the Municipal
court; and Joseph Savidge, candidate
for county judge. The president of
the club, although representing one
faction of the Republican party, is
maintaining a neutral policy by se-
lecting all three speakers from the op-
posing faction.

In conjunction with this meeting,
fifty students from Prof. Kerwin’s
class have organized to help Mrs.
Goode in her campaign. She will in-
struct them today at 10 o’clock in the
finer points of political campaigning.

OPEN HOUSE TEA

A rag-rug-bee will be the outstand-
ing event of the first W. A. A. open
house tea this quarter, to be held’to-
day at 3:30 in the correctiver gymnas-
ium of Ida Noyes hall.

The rugs will be used for the lodge
which members of W. A. A. expect
to open by the end of the quarter,
according to a statement of the presi-
dent, Francis Lawton. In order to
make the rag-rug-bee more interesting
the girls who come to the tea will be
divided into teams, the object being to
have the various teams compete in
making the greatest number of yards.
The team captains will be: Marian
Woolsey, Anne Part, Margaret Fier-
baugh, Florence Herzman, Eloise
White, Elizabeth Garrison and Marie
Remmert. There will be nine teams in
all.

Other plans for W. A. A. include the
initiation dinner which will be held
April 21 at 5:30, to be followed by
a dinner at 6:30, in the sun parlor of
Ida Noyes hall.

At the first board meeting of W.
A. A., Helen Mitchell was selected to
take charge of the official scrap book
during the coming year.

the personnel of the leaders had to be
made. Paul Lewis, Sophomore presi-
dent, contracted a severe case of the
“flu”, and is confined to his home
under doctor's orders. Kyle Anderson,
treasurer of the class, has been ap-
pointed by the class council to suc-
ceed him. The revised list of lead-
ers now reads: Kyle Anderson and
Helen King, George Poole and Janet
Goode.

Publish Maroon

A special edition of The Daily’ Ma-
roon, in the form of a Prom Maroon,
will be issued during the intermission
as one of the features of the evening.
The Maroon is edited by Al Widdi-
field. This issue will serve in the place
of programs, containing dance num-
bers, a program of the evening, a list
of patrons and patronesses, and gen-
eral information concerning the Prom.

Miss Elizabeth Donelly is in charge
of refreshments. She has provided
that punch and cookies will be served
to the guests throughout cht evening.

Plan Features

As features of the evening, it is in-
timated that several stars of the recent
Mirror production will entertain the
guests. This is a result of the evident
effort on the part of the leaders to
make the ball a strictly campus affair.

Tickets for the affair have enjoyed

a huge sale on campus,
tickets are requested to
206 today at 2. in order
surplus tickets and

Those selling
meet in Cobb
to turn in any
the collected

money. The returned tickets may be
purchased at the door this evening
by those who have not been able pur-
chase bids previously.

Special checking facilities are prom-
ised for this evening. Those attending
the Score club dance at the same hotel
last autumn quarter were inconveni-
enced by the lack of proper checking
facilities. This situation will be rem-
edied tonight, the Prom leaders prom-
ise.

subscriptions. You glance at a bulletin board; Maroon-week posters
catch your eye. You try even to walk across the campus; a sales-

is going crazy. Well, we are. But that shouldn't hinder you from

It is a very new thing, and one which will grow and im-

need which the college paper should supply.

Its material must come from campus writers. There are plenty
of poems, plenty of short stories, plenty of half-forgotten themes,
which should be retrieved and submitted for publication, for it is
only through this means that the Supplement can become really
representative of campus.

meet tonight will be especially impor-
tant in determining just who is to run
on the half mile relay team and on the
mile team race outfit.

Jimmy Cusack, Duga, Hitz. Hoge-
vich, Dystrup, Boynton, and John Cu-
sack are all expected to show very
well in the mile team race for they
have all made fast time in the indi-
vidual mile try outs. In the half
mile relay tryout McKinney and Kern-
wein, last year's “C” men and Stu
Spence. Miekelberry, Weddell, Beall.
Armstrong. Metzenburg and L. E.
Sniithall are strong.

In the Individual events on Tuesday
the usual events will be changed about
in order, the 220 coming third on the
schedule. XJost of the varsity men
will compete to try out -for chances
at the special national events. The
meet will start promptly at 7:30
o'clock so that the contestants may
be through by 8:30.

PREP SPLASHERS

HOPE TO BREAK

SPEED RECORDS

Many Outstanding Stars
Are Entered In

Meet

It is- well known fact that the ma-
jority of records in swimming are
broken by men of high school age. not
always of course representing their
high schools, but in the meet to be
held on tonight and Saturday, April
9 and 10, at Bartlett Natatorium there
will be several outstanding stars.

Due to the friction between the city
high schools and state organizations
the interscholastic swimming meets so
far this season have been a great dis-
appointment, but as the meet at Bart-
lett is open only to teams in the State
of Illinois, all city and suburban
schools have entered, and with the ex-
ception of a few individual stars here
and there about the country, the cream
of the swimmers will be found in this
group, so that this Interscholastic
Meet should prove to be the best of
the year. Judging from the entries
and enthusiasm, it will probably be
much better than last year’s meet
which was pronounced a success.

There are several outstanding stars
entered in this meet. R. Peterson of
Lindblom is holder of the National
Interscholastic High School Breast
Stroke Record, and his times in compe-
tition compare favorably with N. A.
A. U. times. His teammate, Sam
Carter lias equalled the N. A. A. U.
and conference records for the 40 yd.
dash in practice, and his time is only
a fraction of a second slower in com-
petition.

Here’s a Wonderful Method
Of Conditioning a Football

Team; Better Than Scrimmage

By Victor Roterus

That, in years to come, there will
be listed among the • college major
sports that group of antics now termed
the Charleston seems eminently pos-
sible from recent carryings-on in the
east—it being recognized that any-
thing is possible of an age subsisting
there “all the hoakum that is politics
on 3 per cen tonics.

The Whole Truth

The conclusion that such an event
is a possibility is not the result of
idle speculation, but is based on some
reports drifting in from our rather
spasmodic eastern correspondent. He
states that a number of schools on the
Atlantic seaboard have followed a few
larger institutionsin adopting the
Charleston as a conditioner for their
athletic teams.

The Penn State football squad con-
ducted by Hugo Bezdek and the West
V irginia wrestlers coached by Steve
Harrick have included the wild dance
in their drills as a preliminary exer-

Recommended gladly

by hosts of friends everywhere.
Lucky Strikes offer the most appeal-
ing flavor, an extra goodness

cise; and the smaller schools trusting
in the superior wisdom of their eld-
ers have followed suit, so that the
Charleston is now quite prevalent in
eastern gymnasiums.

Coach Bezdek however, declared
taht he would discard the jointloosen-
ing rgy as soon as the weather per-
mitted his men to practice out of
doors, but that for the present his
squad would proceed to produce, sys-
tematically or otherwise, wooden-
sounding clicks on the gym floor.

Some Dance!

The result following the adoption
of the fling ’em here and fling ’em
there motion by the West Virginia
wrestlers is interesting. The coach of
the team had been considerably handi-
capped by a distinct lack of material
to work with. But a week after he
had installed the dance the size of the
squad was quadrupled.

So it seems that tffe day when the
campus sheik will take his place by the
broad-shouldered football eroes in the
varsity lettermen’s club is dawning.

FIVE FRESHMEN

With one of the best Freshman
track teams in years working out
daily Coach Lonnie Stagg yesterday
announced the tentative list of men
who woudl receive the 1929 honor
awards. According to the system now
in vogue a certain record is required
and this must be done twice so that
it is almost impossible to win a sweat-
er on a fluky one day record.

Frey, the sensational frosh high
jumper, is perhaps the star of the ag-
gregation. He has already cleared 5
feet II and should have no trouble in
making the varsity next season. Ben-
nett is also a very gonod high jump-
er. Burke and Williams are two star
milers who will help round out a rec-
ord breaking four mile team in 1927.
Wilkins is a promising half miler.

SOMETHING DIFFERENT

Somewhere, sometime, haven’t you
read a poem, or a bit of prose, or a
clever story which particularly |
caught your fancy? Don’t you save
clippings of little things you like?
So do I; so does everybody else. Here
in the Whistle, we have what is sup- I
posed to be a medium for the ex*
change of things which amuse us.
But must it always be original local
stautt? Why, I ask, should the
Whistle through lack of talent be ;
restained to dumb rhymes about pet ‘
ting, and clumsy witticisms about
drinking? Or what is worse, be sat-
isfied with the weak efforts of cam-
pus efforts? There are so many good
things being written these da^s
which do not appear in the Wistle!
Most of us haven’t the time to search
them out; why not trade our dis-
coveries with each other? Let’s try
to avoid the well known things—
“The Fog,” etc. Send in, rather, the
equally artistic bits which you have
found in obscure places, or in lonely
books.

Helman:

be dropped into any Faculty Ex-
change box besides the box in the
