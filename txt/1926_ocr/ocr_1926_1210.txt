UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1926	Price Five Cent.

WHAT OF
IT?

Ihe dull days are undeniably here.
Nothing to rel eve their grey monot-
ony but going to class, returning from
class, and going once more. There
, re long waits around the frat house,
with just an occasional, desultory con-
versation flaring up palely for a mo-
ment, only to die down completely a
moment later, as the talkers again
lapse into lethargy, to relieve at all
the flat tonality of the days. J, for
one, am beginning to look forward to
the visits of those stray performers
who turn up, year in and year out,
along the fraternity row, to liven with
their eccentricities or trick perform-
ances the dullness of the collegians
life. Where, right now. 1 wonder, is
that fellow who used to let himself be
tied up with sixty feet of rope, and

then would work free of

the bonds

I for a sum collected in one of the
house intramural tropines) within so
many minutes? Some other college, I
suppose, has his presence—bleak, win-
try Dartmouth, grey Y ale, .muddy
Champaign.

These wanderers through the world
of the fraternity houses have been ev-
erywhere, performing for a day or two
their specialties, pocketing their col-
lections, and then moving on along
the never-ending round. From Bow-
doin to Southern California they are
known; everywhere they have got loose
from their ropes, or tied themselves
in knots, to the edification of the bored
collegian. Their circle of acquaint-
ance is something to marvel at. Other
generations of college mep have known

them; fellows in

now at Ore-

gon Aggies, Alma, Indiana or Ober-
lin will recall their faces instantly
when they turn up once again. Years
from now, I imagine, other college
boys will know them, and wonder
where they are pulling their tricks, and
when they will come again. •

Only one of the troupe have I seen
this year—a yodelling entertainer who
was also, from time to time, a chim-
ney-sweep. He appeared around this
place earlier in the fall, with the as-
sertion that he had swept the chim-
neys of other chapters of the frat-club,
and many more besides it, and with
a scrap book of college stickers and
post-cards to back up his claim. He
graced the house for a while, sitting
agreeably on the sofa with the boys
and telling them just how different
chapters of their fraternity rated com-
paratively. “Syracuse? Well.. .pretty
good at Syracuse. Kenyon... there’s a
swell chapter. No. you’re not so good
at Trinity. The Michigan chapter?
Let’s see...oh, yes! That’s the bunch
who wear such nice clothes and sit
around all day and never do anything.
Gentlemen.. .BUT lazy. Well, that’s

no drawback.”
minutes on end.

And so he went on,
Good stuff, I felt.

Without ever

having been near a

college as one of its members, these
itinerants know their universities far
better than anyone I know. They are
not bothered by any false conceptions
of values. They see things as they are
—a fraternity in terms of clothes, of
food, in the number of smooth fellows
with well-cut coats sitting around the
fire. They have the true angle of
things. Their rough impressions of
colleges and places are far more ac-
curate than, say, that of a paid edu-
cational survey expert would be. They
see Illinois as a madhouse of the dull
—swarms rushing about in a Piggly-
Wiqgly; Chicago as a department
store—orderly and big and useful in a

WITH PRICELESS'
ASIATIC DISPLAY

Palestine Treasures On
Display For First
Time Yesterday

For the first time in history

and

probably for the last time in history,
treasures from the only royal tomb
ever found in Palestine were placed
on exhibit when the Oriental Institute
and Haskell Museum reopened yester-
day after being closed for almost a

year.

When
from the
fall, the

the Divinity school moved
Museum to its new home last
Institute under the direction

of Professor James Henry Breasted
began to bring to light treasures, some
of which had been stored away since
1890.

Adding to these their more recent
purchases, the Palestine exhibit be-
ing acquired but a few months ago,
the directors finally arranged the pres-
ent display, which includes the price-
less treasures of Egypt, Arabia, West-
ern Asia, Mesopotamia and the Pales-
tine exhibit which was open for yes-
terday only. The others will remain
open permanently. *

Haskell Museum also shelters the
Oriental Institute and with it most of

the Department of Oriental
guages.

PLACE EXHIBITION OF
REMEBRANDT IN W31

Various stages of Rembrandt’s etch-
ings, contained in three folios and a
catalogue, have been placed on exhibi-
tion in the cases in W31 and on the
law bridge. Mr. Dimitri Rovinski, a
Russian, produced this series about
1892 and sent an autographed copy to
the University at the time it was
founded. This copy is interesting be-
cause it is one of the earliest small
gifts to the University.

Freshman Loses
Sex Appeal; Fur

Benny Is Stolen

“Hey fellows, my sex appeal is
gone!”

Early last night Aaron Heimbach,
a Kappa Nu pledge, aroused the
house at 5629 Uuniversity Ave. with
the announcement that thugs had
encountered him in front of the
Delta Sig house as he was returning
from an errand on Fifty-fifth st.,
and after tapping him on the head
in acknowledgment, had fled with
his raccoon coat.

Heimbach, who says that his as-
sailents were quite youthful in ap-
pearance, was not given an oppor-
tunity to defend himself or to make
an outcry. As the thieves leaped on
him from behind, he joked with them
at first under the impression that
they were playful fraternity broth-
ers.

Meanwhile the despoiled freshman
is not in particularly deep mourning,
for he finds that the insurance com-
pany which was covering his coat had
gratuitously extended his policy,
which had elapsed the day before -
the robbery, for another week.

ager, before Wednesday. Non-club

THE DAILY MAROON

! Dramatic Association To
Offer Barry’s Comedy

This Evening

Who, it is asked, is the Youngest?
Perhaps a boy. Maybe a girl. But
there is an answer, and the answer is
to be revealed tonight.

It is to be answered under the di-
rection of Mr. Frank Hurburt O’Hara.
By a cast of the Dramatic association.

stage. »

Successful In East

Philip Barry once wrote a play that
he entitled “The Y oungest,” and that
play was produced in New York city.
It was a success and had a long run.
Then someone suggested that the play
be brought to Chicago.

New Yorkers now know “The
Youngest,” and Chicagoans do not.
But tonight against a set of scenery
that was built with'years of savings
of the Dramatic association, garbed in
a wardrobe fashioned at an expense
of $800, and with a cast that is both
talented and eminent, the University
Dramatic association will tonight not
only reveal who is the youngest but
will supply comedy, produce thrills
—Do its best to interest Philip Bar-
ry’s great hit.

Academic Standard

\	______

"The present low standard of scho

of students desiring participation in

cents one may have the opportunity
of a grab.

Marcella Venemma requests that
all women who have signed up to
: help appear at the appointed time.

undergraduate activities, should be
raised.”

Merle C. Coulter, assistant dean of
the colleges bclFves that the present
requirement of a ‘C average for par-
ticipation in an activity, acts as a
temptation towari "slumping,” and of-
fers no incentive for the exertion of
the student's best efforts.

"The raised standard will act as an
inducement toward greater effort,”
Coulter continued. “Actual experimen-
tation in higher scholastic standing, 1

believe, will reveal to both the stu-
dent sand faculty ,the beneficial results
of a higher requirement.”

Coulter has formed his opinions on
the question after active contact with
the students in the official capacity as
dean, and also as an undergraduate
in the clss of 1914. The students in
his class, according to Coulter, al-
though active in student organiza-
tions, were as content with a scholas-
tic average of ‘C’ as are the present
undergraduates.

SENIORS!

WE REALIZE that the question of financial support of the various
activities has been overdone, because the same few people
have supported the many activities. The Senior Class each year
finds it hard to get the members of the class interested in their
own affairs. Tonight, for example, there is to be held at Ida
Noyes the first class affair of the year in the form of a dinner, with
speakers who warrant a full table. Yet, out of a class of 430 or
more, there are about 60 tickets for the affair actually sold. Seniors,
we realize that Christmas is coming and that dollars, are few and
far between; but let’s support this our first attempt.

NEW AND OLD AND SECOND-HAND

IN THESE DAY of commercialization, when the world rolls on in
its frenzied rush and passes by the poor belated university pro-
fessors, we stop to wonder how some of them exist on their meagre
pittances. • With Hank Mencken constantly running their trade to
the ground, and H. G. Wells and William Randolph Hearst con-
demning their schools the poor lads have a truly tough time of it.

Now to add to their weighty cares, comes the university student
with a new scheme to deprive some enterprising profs of the chance
to become plutocrats. Campus jest and jollity has always jibed
at the fact that with every change in department heads comes a
change in three-and-a-half-buck and five-case-note books. Or when
their is really no possible excuse for changing the text, a nice little
revised edition will do the trick very nicely.

These indiscretions we bear in silence. University profs must
live and our paters must expect to support them if they want us to
be nicely educated college men. We rise to protest or whatever it
is that one does in protest, when we purchase a neatly bound volume
with a nice red cover or a pretty green tint and then stride to a
class at the beginning of a quarter, with the said volume tucked un-
der our arm. Then on the second day we stride to class with the
same book under ouf arm. But after we have been striding for a
week or more and the little red book has not been the object of an
assignment we store it carefully away, uncracked, until another day
when in need of a cup of coffee, we will turn to the book store for
help. And for the little red book, uncracked as yet, we can easily
get the price of a cup of coffee.

This quarter we were fortunate in owning but one text book
which was useless. In English 103 two assignments have been made
in "Progressive Readings in Prose.” In English 101, we are in-
formed, some equally useless book has been totally unused. Ru-
mors reach our ears of other courses which require useless texts.
If the books were even worth owning we would not object, but they
are invariably tiresome dogmas, or incomplete collective works.

But now to come to our scheme, which we mentioned before.
By the simple process of waiting until a number of assignments have
been made before purchasing books, we beat the system. Of course
we lose out on the opening shots of the instructors, but the opening
shots are usually wide of the mark anyhow.

THE BEST SINGING IN TOWN

Conductor Weber
Talks On Duty of
Operatic Leaders

"\V1 at is a conductor, is a ques-
tion which is asked every day of the
week by people of musical understand-
ing;’ according to Henry G. Weber
oi the Chicago Civic Opera Company,
youngest musical conductor in Grand
Opera, the only American opera con-
ductor and a native of Chicago.

Conductor Is Leader

"The common understanding is that
the conductor's function is to regulate
the time of the orchestra. That is a
mistake. He is the great co-relating
medium between the efforts of the en-
tire artistic personnel unifying them
in a complete and balanced whole,”
said Mr. Weber.

"Singers are prone to be selfish.
They cannot help it, for their thoughts
very naturally centers upon personal
success, whereas the conductor di-
vorces himself from every personal
equation and is concerned only and
totally in the perfection of the • er
formance as a whole. stated Mr.
Weber.

Conductor Abstract

"The singer typifies personality—
the conductor is the spirit and essence
of the abstract. Were the singers al-
lowed to do so, they would make of
opera no mosiac, each doing his or hei
hest and distorting the performance
to that end, whereas the conductor, un-
mindful of personal ambitions or idio-
syncracies, struggles for a well round-
ed, perfect performance. The units in
that performance mean nothing to
him; the complete result means ev-
erything.”

STUDENT EXPRESSES
OPINIONS ON ETHICS

OF THOUGHTFULNESS

By N. E. Sinninger

"I did not think." What a multitude
of inconsiderate actions this phrase
covers! University life is not exempt,
from “profs” to “freshie.”

Mr. Grimpe, your studiousness may
be commendable. But you “did not
think” that your next room neighbor
had not yet learned to go to sleep
to the lullaby of an all-night typewrit-
stairs that you could practice the Gold-
en Rule with the janitor’s mop.

not think" when you went up the

And you, Professor Keepatum,
when you "bawled out” your class the
other day "did not think” that the stu-
dent who had worked hardest to
please you, took your words most seri-
usly. And yclu, Professor Kosms,
when you made that remark about
"people who take their science from
the Bible,’ ’"did not think” that you
brought a young freshman to the point
of spiritual tragedy.

Is the universe for these people too
small to make room for considerate-
ness?

Perseverance Key

To Shaw’s Success

Bernard Shaw owed much of his
success to perseverance and work,
according to Dr. Archibald Hender-
son of the University of North
Carolina, who spoke at a William
Vaughn Moody Foundation lecture
recently.

It seems impossible to think of
that biting satire, those sparkling
epigrams of his or anything but
the spontaneous and effortless over-
How of a naturally brilliant mind.
W ork and Bernard Shaw. That
looks like a "finer inaccuracy of
higher mathematics.”

Said the famous dramatist, “I
want to be quite used up when I
die, for the harder I work the more
I live.” Strange as it seems, we
have to admit that Shaw has reach-
common beaten path of hard work,
cd the place where he is by the
W ithout it he would have remained
all his life at the level of his first
novels—the worst novels ever writ-

his audience.

Haskell Museum
Opens With New
Oriental Displays
—

Haskell Oriental Museum reopened
its doors at a formal reception last
night, after being remodeled and re-
arranged.

Both ends of the first floor were
made over into exhibition halls, where
the Museum’s finest Egyptian pieces
are now installed. The north room of-
fers exhibits which trace Egyptian
civilization from prehistoric times to
Roman days. The central figure in
this room is a so-called “mummy”
which is really a naturally preserved
body buried a thousand years before
mummifying was invented. In the
wall cases round this “mummy” are
relics from the tombs of Egypt’s first
and second dynasties, together with
hand-wrought pottery and stone vases.

Limestone Figures

In the middle of the north room
stands the largest single group of lime-
stone figures yet found in one tomb.
Its original owner who lived about
2500 B. C. wished to maintain his do-
mestic establishment unimpaired in
the next world. According to Egyp-
tian belief the souls of himself and
family had need of bodies after, as
well as before death. If their mummies
were destroyed, substitute bodies like
these little limestone figures might re-
place them. So this ancient gentleman
has taken four such extra bodies for
himself, two for his wife, and a whole
series for sons, daughters and ser-
vants.

Egyptian Arts

In the south room, Egyptian sculp-
ture, writing weapons, furniture and
work in various materials are exhibited
as units. One case is filled with flow-
ers from funeral wreaths of Egyptian
pharoahs. The vanity case of the
Egyptians is shown as a bronze mirror
in a wooden case, but unfortunately
the powder-puff is missing.

The third floor is given to Western
Asia with exhibitions which testify
to the artistic and cultural civiliza-
tions of the ancient Babylonians.

“Women’s athletics are not in a
deplorable condition,” said Miss
Gertrude Dudley, head of the wo-
men’s physical education department
at the University. “Women’s clubs
and the notion that men do not ap-
prove of the athletic type of girl,
however, are two underlying causes
for the apparent lack of interest in
women’s athletics here at the Uni-
versity.”

"There is also the element of awk-
ward schedule. The lack of juniors
and seniors on the hockey teams this
quarter is due to the fact that they
have classes conflicting with hockey
practice. Since this is a non-resh
dent school it is practically impos-
sible for anyone to stay over long
enough to take part in extra athle-
tics.” ",

Cornell Grads Say

Ithaca Is Too Dry

Ithaca is too dry for a college
town.

This is the opinion of the Cornell
graduates who return to visit their
Alma Mater. “There ain’t the fel-
lows here now that there used to
be. You see, there’s too many
movies in this town now and they
take all the boy’s time and money;
the boys don't drink like they used
to—it’s slow.” “The things we did
and the parties we had will we ever
forget them?” "Dry except for the
medical profession’ and “No one
should ever visit a dry town.”

I hese are typical impressions
which the alumni have recorded in
a "Register of Old Grads, Would-
Be Grads, and Busts to be Handed
Down to Posterity,” which is kept
•t Cornell.

AF	NITET

Women’s athletics are rapidly de-
veloping and gaining in prominence,
Miss Dudley believes but she dreads
the day of women’s intercollegiate
sports. However, as the feeling for
this new action in athletics is grow-
ing, there is also a reaction against
them which is lead by the Confer-
ence of American College Women,
and the National Amateur Athletic
Federation. “There is a feeling”,
Miss Dudley concluded, “that women
are too nervously constituted for
participation in intercollegiate
sports.”

At the left the wood cut is a typical
panel by Arthur Machia, Bohemian
wood-carver. The panel was made for
a poster advertising a recent produc-
tion of "King Agrimenes and the Un-
known Warrior,” a play by Lord Dun-
sany which was given at one of the
colony’s little theatres. These plays
are of the crudest sort. Aften they are
little more than public rehearsals.

Machia, at the right is of the famous
“hole-in-the-wall” doorway to the Dill
Pickle Club, a well known rendezvous
on the near north side for modern

Mr. Machia is a protege of King
Jones of the Dill Pickle Club. Before

OFF THE SHELF

As the Christmas holidays ap-
proach and we hear the cry for
something new in the line of gifts
we are moved to suggest a few of
the newer books which will help the
book-lover to a complete enjoyment
of the Yuletide season.

Books As Gifts

One should be interested, in the
collection of thought-carvings which
Louise Jordan Miln offers us in her
delightful novel, “It Happened In
Peking”. Then R. L. Megroz has
published a friendly little book on
“A Talk With Joseph Conrad and a
Criticism of His Mind and Method.”
Henry Green is a young Oxford man
but his first novel, “Blindness” is at-
tracting much attention among the
critics. “Paris”, by Sidney Dark,
and “With Eastern Eyes” by Ernest
Poole are both well worth the giving
and receiving.

“Ninth Avenue”

Maxwell Bodenheim seems to de-
serve a little more attention because

of his new novel “Ninth Avenue”,
not so much for its excellence as for
its uniqueness. He has taken up in
this book the modern refrain of strip-
ping a character until it has only a
frugal cloak of sexual impulses left
to cover its bareness.

Every resident of Ninth Avenue is
a nonentity staggering under a bur-
den of sensuality. But out of this
maelstorm of evil the author creates
one character just a little bit differ-
ent from the rest.

“The Dark Dawn”

A very realistic and powerful piece
of literature is “The Dark Dawn”
the result of Martha Ostenso’s second
successful attempt to make known
to the world the homely lives of a
real peasant class in America, the
Scandinavians of North Dakota and
Minnesota. Hattie Murker, the in-
domitable personality, resembles
Caleb Gare of “Wild Geese” but her
relentless power over people is
mental rather than physical.

SOCIALLY------
------SPEAKING

The Dramatic Association’s produc-
tion "The Youngest” is to be given to-
night with many campus notables in
the cast, including Ruth DeWitt, Jack
Stambaugh, and Russell Whitney in
the leading roles and participants in
other activities as the leaders of the
mob. The clubs and fraternities have
taken blocks of seats or boxes and
plan to attend "en masse.” Judging
from the advance notices, the play
should be very amusing and well at-
tended.

Quadrangler Party

The same evening the Quadranglers
are giving a "Black and White” par-
ty at the home of Mary Roberts in
Oak Park. This unique idea should

make an extremely effective dance
something quite different besides.

All day today, the annual Y.
C. A. bazaar is being held in
Noyes. All kinds of novelties
Christmas gifts are for sale; and

and

W.
Ida
for
al-

though it is hard to realize that vaca-
tion is nearly upon us, this opportun-
ity for buying presents is a god-send

for the harassed student.

Achoth Formal Dance

Saturday night the Achoth fall for-
mal is to be held at the Drake and
the Sigma formal is to be given at the
Country Club Apartments. The last
house dances of the quarter are being
given the same night by the Phi
Gam’s and by the Sigma Chi’s.

This week ends the social' activities
of the fall quarter, for whether we
believe it or not an intellectual atmo-
sphere will pervade the campus next
week. The fall social season for the
University has closed.

CONTRIBUTORS AND

REPORTERS NEEDED

There are a few openings on The
Daily Maroon for students wishing
to write for the feature section.
Freshmen and Upper-classmen who
are interested, have been asked to
report to Alice Kinsman, feature
editor, in the Maroon office.

book reviews, feature stories, inter-
views, poems and short stories may
be sent through the Faculty Ex-
change, to the Feature Editor.

By Willis P. Drew

John Van Druten has made the uni-
versal problem confronting the boy
of seventeen, who for the first time
is conscious of his sex instincts, the
basis for his “Young Woodley,” pre-
sented at the Blackstone theater.

The play holds one’s attention so
closely during the performance that
it is only during the slow procession
up the aisle to the exit that one be-
gins to realize Mr. Van Druten has
really tried to put over a construc-
tive idea in his absorbing little
drama.

The play is something of an at-
tack on the disciplinary methods em-
ployed in the English schools in their
effort to avert serious trouble dur-
ing the period of adolescence, and
offers as a better plan the “under-
standing and sympathy” method. It
is not at all surprising that the Eng-
lish play-censors refused Van Druten
their permission to produce the play
in London. When a country like
England has an educational system
upon which it has long prided itself,
a twenty-four old playwright must
not be allowed to reveal its discrep-
ancies.

Glenn Hunter approaches perfec-
tion in his portrayal of Young Wood-
ley. His love affair is dignified and
pathetic, his awkwardness is never
overdone. Helen Gahagan made a
little too much work of her role as
the professor’s wife, but she played
it earnestly and the audience liked
her.

Is Censorship Cure
Or Cause of Evil?

“It is the purveyor of filth who
gets liberty when there is no cen-
sorship,” declared Rev. Elmer L.
Williams, the "Fighting Parson,”
defending the censorship of books
and plays in a recent debate with
T. V. SMITH, assistant dean of
colleges at the University.

“I have never in my life read a
censored book without enjoying it
thoroughly,” Professor Smith said
in return. “Opinions on books, dif-
fer too widely for efficient censor-
ship. If I were a censor and had
to cut out some books, the first ones
I would choose would be the Songs
of Solomon, and “Don Juan.”

“Modesty and tolerance remain
great human virtues,” Professor
Smith continued. “The scheme of
censorship is undemocratic since it
presupposes a distrust of both peo-
ple and knowledge. It is a cause,
not a cure of human wrong.”

Scientists Predict
New Glacial Era

“Complete submersion of Chicago
by Lake Michigan is to be expected
in a very short time ,and the element
which once rose to the level of the
third story of Cobb Hall and would
have floated ice burgs in its windows,
had it stood then, will again come into
its own.”

However, Professor J. Harlen Bretz,
of the department of geology who
made this statement, adds that there
is no need to desert the city, for it
will take at least 3,000 years for this
to happen. Nevertheless the basin of
staid old Lake Michigan is gradually
tipping southward, and less Chicago
continues to divert water through the
drainage canal such a result is prob-
able.

Former Inundation

“To be covered with water would
be no novelty to this region," said
Professor Bretz, “for the bed-rock of
limestone on which such buildings as
the new chapel are built, bears a rec-
ord of several inundations. The lime-
stone itself originated in a sea 'of sub-
tropical temperature and now lies with
a fifty foot covering of glacial sands.
The recent excavations for Weiboldt
Hall showed stratified sand with the
imprint of wave motion upon it.”

Chicago is built on a plane which
was in turn built under forty feet of
glacial water.

has a wealth of material from which
to build a team.

Michigan, with Molenda. Ooster-
baan. and Friedman back, will remain
throughout the season a continual
threat. Purdue lost Spradling and
Cramer by graduation, but rumors in-
dicate a formidable team in the mak-
ing. Minnesota as usual an unknown
quantity, may upset the dope bucket
and produce a championship aggrega-
tion.

Northwestern and Illinois have fair1
teams but do not look like title con-
tenders. Little is known at the pres
ent time about Ohio and Iowa, against
whom Chicago opens its Big Ten
schedule on January 8th. Either of
these schools, however, may spring a
surprise and capture honors. Indiana,
all probability, will have a capable :
team and will be a source of trouble to !
al! of its opponents. With Captain Ju- 1
litis Krcuger as a nucleus, Coach Dean I
is busy developing a formidable outfit.

No Southern Trip Planned for
Maroon Ball Team—Coach Crisler

Rumors were rampant around the

campus yesterday that the Maroon
baseball team was to tour the South
during the spring furlough for the
purpose of engaging divers Southern
colleges in pre-season baseball tilts.

fhe reason given was that Fritz
Crisler. coach, desired to have his
men engage in baseball practice be-
fore the conference games, a thing
which hail been made impossible last
year by the inclement weather. Last
season's first game that played with
Northwestern, was fought out in a
blinding blizzard and before the tcahi
had engaged in a single day of outdoor
practice.

These rumors, as. set forth in yester-
day's morning papers were branded as
utterly false by Crisler, who stated
that they had absolutely no back-
ground. Not only had there been no
consideration of such a project (which
has never been undertake by a Ma-
roon nine), but had there been suchj
a possibility it could not be carried out
as Fritz must be at the school all of
that period, it being Interscholastic
week.

UNIVERSITY RIFLE
CLUB CHALLENGED
BY MANY SCHOOLS

According to reports from the Rifle
Club, the scores for both men and
women are improving rapidly. Twenty-
five men and 1 wenty women have
turned out so far.

Northwestern called yesterday, and
is anxious for a match between the
women's teams the first of next quar-
ter and another to follow later. In
the first match all women of the club
may compete but in the second only
undergraduates may enter.

The following schools have sent
challenges*to the men: University ol
Maryland, University of Illinois, Uni-
versity of Minnesota and Culver Acad-
emy. Challenges for the women have
been received from Northwestern
University, University of Maryland
and the University of Illinois. ,.

Invite Michigan
Stars To Play In

East-West Game

Two of Michigan’s graduating foot-
ball stars, Capt. Benny Friedman, all-
American qurterback. and William
‘Flop Flora, right end for three
years, have been invited to play in the
annual East vs. West game New Year’s
Day’ at San Francisco for the benefit
of the Shriner's Children hospital.
This contest was instituted two years
ago and since that time has grown
to a place of great popularity on the
Pacific coast.

Flora has accepted the invitation to
join the estern team which will be or-
ganized by Lieutenant Beckett, assist-
ant .to Coach “Navy Bill’’ Ingram,
whose duties make it impossible for
him to take charge this year.

Friedman has found it impossible
to make the trip.

The teams are made up of the col-
lege stars of the country but are lim-
ited in their personnel to men who
have played their last year.

BASKET TEAM DOWNS

CAPPER AND CAPPER

Coach Norgren’s basketmen under-
went their first tough scrimmage
last evening when they met the Can-
per & Capper team in a practice
tilt. The Maroons won by a large
margin but were given real competi-
tion by the Capperites. Hoerger and
Kaplan played especially well for
the Maroons, Coach Norgren trying
all of his likely players. Weiss and
Dugan, ex-Midway stars, were in th°
Capper line-up.

Hold Two Day Coaching Session
At Badger School; Starts Today

Madison, Wis., Dec. 10, 1926.—All
preparations have been completed for
the Second Annual Coaching Clinic
of the University of Wisconsin, and
George Little and the members of
his department stand ready to wel-
come the multitude of college and
high school mentors who will arrive
here today for the two day session.

Responses to the invitations mailed
by George Berg, manager of the
Clinic, indicate that last season’s aat-
tendance of 150 will be greatly sur-
passed. This idea of entertaining
the coaches o*f Wisconsin schools and
institutions of the neighboring states
was instituted a year ago, and met
with great approval of those who
were present to hear the instructive-
presentations of such prominent
athletic tutors as George Little, Dr.
Walter Meanwell, Tom Jones, Guy
Lowman, Joe Steinauer, and the
other Badger coaches.

Starting at ten o’clock this morn-
ing a busy program will be followed
until Saturday evening, when the
meeting will close with Mr. Little’s
talk on the forward pass.

I-M Cage Teams

In Early Practice

Preparations for Intramural bask-
etball competition are well under way
at the present time. Dr. Molander
has announced that Bartlett Gym is
open from seven to ten o’clock every
evening for practice during the re-
mainder of the quarter. All of the
fraternities are now gathering their
teams and starting drill. Non-frat-
ernity organizatios are being formed
and also are getting into good trim.

CLASS MEET RICH
IN TRACK ‘FINDS’

Freshman Runners Make
Fast Time

Hopeful joy beams forth once again
on Lonnie Stagg’s countenance as he
surveys his freshman track team each
night. For the interclass meet held
on Wednesday night was rich in ‘fines’
from among hitherto unknown year-
ling track athletes.

Schulz, the sprinter from Hyde
Park High, who dashed off the 440
in 53 seconds flat, made the most out-
standing time of any of his class-
mates. Fifty-three is near top form
for indoor men and according to the
records it is the best time ever made
by a first year man at Chicago.

Meadows, a 50 yard man from Lake
View also caused much comment when
he tied for first in his specialty. The
comment was all the more favorable
when it was learned that the meet
marked his first time out this year.

Whitney of Toledo, with a 11 foot
effort in the pole vault, Weaver of
Jonesboro, Ark., who placed second
in the shot, and Hayden of U. High,
who led his team-mates to a slam in
the hurdles also turned in perform-
ances worthy of note.

The Chicago Track coaches are once
again laying plans to ensare the elu-
sive Big Ten Conference track title.
THE DAILY MAROON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1926

ON BEING A SENIOR

Gee, it’s no fun being a Senior—

All this dignity

Of carrying a cane,

All this respect

Of the upperclassmen.

All this friendliness

From the faculty member# ..

Ah, they know what we’ll be losing

In a few short months,

And they’re just being sorry for us. ..

THE Daily Maroon continues its
agitation for an arrangement which
would keep the coffee shop open dur-
ing the evening. With something of
suspicion we are beginning to wonder
what it is that they do sell there!

(THIS IS AWFULLY CYNICAL)
Part One

Outside the closed door the young
man strode back and forth nervously.
The murmuring of voices as a faint
groan reached his hearing set him to
increased agitation. With clenched
fists, he prayed. Suddenly the door
opened, a whiff of chloroform stole
out from the now quiet room. Then he
heard weak, tiny cries. The white-
garbed attendant stepped out and
nodded the good news. “Nurse.” he
cried happily, “what is it—boy or girl.-'"

Part Two

Outside the closed door the old man
strode back and forth restlessly. The
murmuring of voices as the clinking
of glasses and gurgling of bottles
reached his hearing set him to increas-
ed agitation. Suddenly the door bang-
ed open, a whiff of Turkish cigarettes
stole out with the strains of a blaring
jazz tune. A slim waisted, knickered
person slipped by him with a toss of
a sleek, close-cropped head. “Damn,’’
it murmured as it encountered a pro-
truding table. And then, whistling
shrilling of “Hinky Dinky Parlez
Vous,” it disappeared. “My god,”
cried the old man, as he thought of a
certain scene many years before,
“what is it—boy or girl!”

RELIGION

Down through the clouds comes rain

Denting the earth with deep puddles

Of mud and slush ..

Filling my heart

With terrible fears.

Timidly I tread the rough, uneven
ground...

Slush.. and mud ..

OVER FIVE THOUSAND

TAKE JOURNAUSM IN

FIFTY INSTITUTIONS

Fifty university and college
schools and departments of journal-
ism of professional rank in the
United States gave instruction to 5,<
532 students during the academic
year 1925-26, according to the Jour-
nalism Bulletin, publication of jour-
nalism teachers’ association. Journal-
ism graduates from the 50 schools in
June, 1926, numbered 884, as com-
pared with approximately 500 for the
previous year..

College and university students of
last year were classified as follows:
graduate students, 122; seniors 884;
juniors, 1,454. sophomores, 1,636;
freshmen, 1,357. The number of
women studying journalism was 2,-
106, almost the same as in 1924-25.
The increase of 500 in enrollment
represented almost entirely a gain
in men students.

The University of Wisconsin
Course in Journalism enrolled 305
students and granted the bachelor’s
degree to 58 during the year.
