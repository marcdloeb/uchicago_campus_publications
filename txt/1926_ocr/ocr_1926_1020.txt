WHAT OF
IT?

SOPHS ELECT BOB McKINLAY

The world is full of trusting souls.
One of the most comipon types is the
boy who still thinks that there is a
thrill in seeing one’s stuff in print.
“Doesn’t a feeling of elation surge
over you,*’ he asks, “when your stuff
comes out in the paper every morn-
ing? It must be awfully thrilling to
be in the public eye.” No doubt it is,
but I put the sensation on somewhat
the same level as eating my morning
grape-fruit. Interesting for a min-
ute or so, but it’s soon over and I
go about the regular business of the
day without further thought of it.
And so with the column.

* * • *

Sometimes, I admit, I do feel a
little surge in my otherwise rather
drab spirits. Looking over the col-
umn in the morning, I say to myself
on these occasions, “Not bad; I won-
der if it’ll get a rise out of anyone?”
This act of mine is something like
that which Mr. Nick Kutsch, the em-
inent Iowa halfback, is accustomed
to pull in the corner drug store out in
Iowa City. Mr. Kutsch first orders a
lemon coke, next pulls a tremendous
bundle of out-of-town papers out of
his overcoat pocket, and then goes
through said papers, looking for pic-
tures or articles in which the name
Kutsch is glorified. Whenever Mr.
Kutsch is successful in his quest, he
tears out the article, takes a sip of
his coke, and grunts with satisfaction
“Huh! that’s me!”—holding the clip-
ping up before him. I make this an-
alogy because it is always my custom
to practice candor in this column, and
because the comparison occurs to me.

* * * *

I never, however, let my enthusi-
asm over my own stuff run very far.
I should say that, as a column con-
ductor, I am less arrogant than the
general run. I know that, at best,
the stuff that I write is not so good.
Nothing in a newspaper is, for it is
the nature of journalism to be cheap,
and it is not within the means of
journalism to attempt to pass itself
off as literature.

*	*	*

Mr. Phillip Allen, the professor,
in one of his celebrated heart-to-
heart talks with me recently, brought
up some very interesting opinions
on the subject of newspaper writing.
“I once wrote a paper on a certain
subject,” said Mr. Allen, “and that
paper gave me a considerable reputa-
tion in certain quarters. Yet, I nev-
er have been ashamed of anything I
have ever done so much as I was
with that piece of work. My friend,
Prof, Manly, had the courage to toll
me what he thought of that paper.
‘Phil’, he said, ‘some of that stuff
was the best that has ever been writ-
ten on that subject. Some of it,
even, was the "best that was ever
written on any subject. But the rest
—are you ready? Well, if I could
write like you did in part of that pa-
per, I would either write that way
ALL the time, or I’d keep my mouth
forever shut’. And that’s the way
with lots of newspaper stuff—very
good part of the time, and blather
the rest. And that’s the way with
newspaper writers—some of them.
There’s Arthur Brisbane, a dunghill
of genius. He’s made six million
dollars, and who cares? And there’s
the danger of newspaper stuff—
that you write stuff that’s good part
of the time and so-so the rest, and
never stuff that’s first rate ALL the
time. It’s 4*1 right to write a column.
Do it now because you have nothing
better to do, but get out of it some
time, and try to do something that’s
all of it good.”

Good counsel, and I shall keep it
in mipd as I go pounding on. Some
day, perhaps...............

UNIVERSITY MAN
IS NEW ILLINOIS
COLLEGE DEAN

Former University Dean
Accepts New
Position

Professor William D. MacClintock,
formerly dean at the University of
Chicago, has been appointed Acting
Dean at Illinois College to succeed the
late Dean George H. Scott.

Professor MacClintock is an alum-
nus of Kentucky Wesleyan College
and also of the Union Theological
Seminary of New York City. He did
his post graduate work at Jonhs Hop-
kins University and studied during
three years in the British Museum in
London. His field of work is F ig-
lish.

On First Chicago Faculty

He was one of the original faculty
called to the University of Chicago
when President William Rainey Har-
per organized that institution in 1892.
He served successively as assistant
professor of English, associate profes-
sor and full professor. For seventeen
years, from 1892 to 1909, he acted as
Dean of the Junior College, having
under his special charge the freshmen
and sophomore classes of the Liberal
Arts College.

It happens that he had retired from
active service on the University fac-
ulty last June but still being in very
vigorous health, he accepted the invi-
tation from the Trustees of Illinois
College to serve as Acting Dean and
Acting Professor of English during
the present year. Professor MacClin-
tock will probably not offer any
courses in English the first semester
but will probably offer an elective
course at the beginning of the second
semester.

Takes Up Duties Soon

He is well known as a teacher and
lecturer in the field of English liter-
ature. He has lectured occasionally
in Jacksonvile, appearing a few
years ago in the Lecture Course of
the Woman’s College.

It is expected that Professor Mac-
Clintock will go within a very few
days to begin his duties at the Col-
lege.

This appointment was made by the
Trustees at a special meeting held at
the president’s house last Monday
evening.

Traditional Lantern

Parade to Climax
1926 Frosh’ Fete

Freshman Frolic for entering women
and their upperclass councilors will be
held Friday from 7 to 9 in the thea-
ter and sun-parlor of Ida Noyes hall.
The women will get acquainted as
they dance to the strains of a select
orchestra of well-known campus
players. After partaking of refresh-
ments, the women will be furnished
with lanterns, and the traditional
lantern parade will commence. From
the President’s house, the group will
proceed to other places of interest on
campus.

Wyvern to Entertain

Club Pledges at Tea

Wyvern announces a tea for all
pledges of the women’s clubs Friday
at 3 in Ida Noyes hall. Wyvern is
the first this year to entertain the club
pledges. It is an annual custom for
the pledges of the various clubs to
entertain the other pledges and it is
hoped with the large number of Wy-
vern pledges the affair will be even
more successful than usual.

Fathers Will Sit in “C” Section

Tuach’s Bad Eye

Came Peacefully

For the sole purpose of allaying
the many more or less vague ru-
mors floating around the campus
concerning Bill Tuach’s bandaged
eye, the Maroon herewith presents
the first specifically correct account
of the incident. The bandage was
called into use, not as concealment
for the result of an altercation, not
to hide the work of some ambushed
bed-post, but merely to give rest to
a carbon-infected eye.

While on a geology trip with Dr.
Noe somewhere south of Verona,
the wind blew a bit of stray carbon
from Tuach’s lamp into his eye and
infection was the result. At the
present writing, he is reported to be
resting as easily as it is possible to
with one eye and a half barred
from normal usage.

COMPLETE WORK
FOR HONOR BALL

Tickets Available For
Shoreland Affair

The first dance of the social sea-
son, given by Score Club and Skull
and Crescent Friday, October 29,
from 9 to 1 in the ballroom of the
Shoreland Hotel, is only a little over
a week off. Preparations for the an-
nual pledge dance are about complete.

Following the announcement of the
orchestra yesterday, WalterFord’s of
the Trianon, tickets were placed on
sale and final arrangements made with
the management of the Shoreland Ho-
tel to insure a great “blowoff" for
the gala affair.

YEAR BOOK EDITOR
OFFERS REDUCTION;

REQUESTS PICTURES

Subscriptions for the Cap and
Gown may be obtained from saleswom-
en around campus or at the Cap and
Gown office in Lexington Hall. The
price, now four dollars, will be raised
to five dollars in the spring.

Mr. Scholz, editor of the publica-
tion, Vated that the book will be larg-
er this year, having more features
such as the snapshot section. Seniors,
clubwomen and fraternity men are
urged to have their pictures taken at
the Morrison Studios, 64 W. Randolph.
Seniors must have their pictures in by
November fifth, while the deadline for
all others is November fifteenth.

Y. W. ELECTS TWO
WOMEN ON CABINET

Irma Stadter, head of the Industrial
committee, and Frances Holt, head of
the World Fellowship committee,
were elected members of the Y. W.
C. A. cabinet on Monday.

Women are needed to assist with the
club work, recreation, cooking classes,
game room, and handcraft at the Uni-
versity settlement. Mona Flanders, a
chairman of settlement committee,
says there are positions open for twen-
ty women. Anyone interested is ask-
ed to report to the Y. W. C. A. of-
fice for information in regard to hours
of work.

Plans were discussed for coopera-
tion with the two National Student
Secretaries, Miss Breedin and Miss
Burgess.

enable them to sit with their sons and
daughters.

Letters have been received from fa-
thers in nearly every state in the Un-
ion by Clyde Keutzer, chairman of the

program. Yesterday he received ac-
ceptances from Massachusetts, Texas,
Missouri, Iowa, and Kansas. He also
received many telegrams and tele-
phone calls.

Because so many fathers intend td
attend the program Saturday the din-
ner that night will be held in Bartlett
gymnasium instead of in the Reynolds
club as was planned previously. The
price of the dinner will be $1.50 per
plate and will be served to the fathers

Coming at the height oF the foot-
ball season, between the Illinois and
Wisconsin games, the second number
of the Phoenix this quarter to appear

with dissertation on the great collegi-
ate sport.

The football number, following a
well received and successful Fresh-
man issue, will be published hy a more
fully organized staff and will better

Contributions for the magazine must
be in before October 25, the announce-
ment states. Serious work as well as
art and humorous articles, are solicit-
ed.

The staff is not yet complete and
those interested in imitating the great
humorists of the ages or in surpassing
their efforts may be able to find a me-
dium of expression in the Phoertix.

As to the business end of the mat-
ter, saleswomen will be required to re-
port early on the date of publication
to receive their magazines. Good ad-
vertising men in need of jobs will find
the coffers of the Phoenix ready to re-
ceive the fruit of any efforts that they
put forth.

Use Candy Money

For C. & A. Work

Proceeds of the candy* and sand-
wich counter operated by Comad mem-
bers in the Commerce and Adminis-
tration lobby are to be used to help
finance the University Journal of Bus-

attendants donate their services.

BROADCAST DARROW

TOMORROW EVENING

Clarence Darrow, famous criminal
lawyer is listed as one of the speakers
who will broadcast over WMAQ on
the Wednesday programs. The lectures
are sponsored by Northwestern Uni-
versity and the Chicago Daily News
in conjunction with contemporary
thought courses given at the Evans-
ton school.

Other noted people on these middle
week programs are W. L. Lewis, in-
ventor of Lewisite gas; Edwin E. Slos-
son, author and director of Science

“Kid” Snubs Meat;

Makes Marks Fish

For tht past few days, Wallie
Marks, football captain and hero,
of the gridiron, has been side-
stepping the campus cops. The
reason for Wallie’s apparent bash-
fulness is obvious ot those who
know the facts.

The alligator, which the captain
of the Florida team presented to
Marks before the game with the
“Tornado Boys,” politely but firm-
ly refuses to eat ordinary meat—
he must have his daily fish.

Consequently, Wallie has been
forced to frequent the neighbor-
hood of Botany pond, much to the
annoyance of its piscatorial inhab-
itants.

MAKE FRIENDS,
CAP MEN TOLD

Directors Outline Duties
To Candidates

Five new Freshman acquaintances a
day for six days is the newest task as-
signed to the candidates for the Green
Cap club.

At the circle yesterday noon, the
Frosh discovered not only that they
must begin to know each other, but
that they must know all of the Uni-
versity traditions this week. They
will also be responsible for the chalk-
ing of the “C” on the stadium.

Upperclassmen, directing the club,
emphasized the fact that streamers'
must be kept parallel to the ground
and announced that stunts would be
prepared to be put on by the fresh-
men between the halves of the foot-
ball games._

OUTLINE YEAR’S

Federation Women

Discuss Value of

Campus Activities

Are activities socially valuable was
the question discussed at an opening
meeting of Federation last night at 7
in the library of Ida Noyes hall. The
general opinion was that activities on
campus are a valuable experience and
a necessary part of college life.

Women’s activities at the University
were considered from various angles.
The question was raised, are there too
many activities, or are the activities
not presented to the women in such
a way as to create an interest in them?
A lack in some respect was felt
Branches of women’s activities were
explained for the benefit of incoming
students.

THE CLASSES

AT THE end of this week twelve new class officers will be recov-
ering from first numbing shock of victory and will be wonder-
ing what they are going to do about their new responsibilities. At
least eleven of them, we will wager, entered the race and election-
eered their respective heads off without the slightest forethought
about what duties and privileges were involved in the business of
running a class.

They are full of good resolves, we know, and full of energy,
we hope. Just what they intend to do with their energy and their
hope is the problem.

Class consciousness has never been sharp at the University of
Chicago. Our observation has been that the average student in
chapel can look around and count the faces of about twenty ac-
quaintances and ten friends. The feeling that the chapel, congre-
gation is composed entirely of classmates is utterly lacking.

Here, we think, is a problem to engage the hope and the en-
ergy of the new officers. If there is any justification for the existence
of a class organization it is that the organization will make the people
in the classes better friends.

Here is a field for unlimited effort. Heads of classes in the
past have reported that the business of making classmates friends
is not an easy one. Class functions have been almost uniformly slim
in attendance, partly because they have advertised inadequately,
partly because they have been uninteresting events and partly be-
cause the promoters of such functions have had little class loyalty
to top.

The new officers, we hope, will not look upon their respective
victories as mere evidences of personal popularity. There is a task
for them to accomplish. Let them attack it with vigor.

PLEDGE DANCE APPROACHES

SCORE CLUB and Skull and Crescent shake hands and pat one
another on the back. "We don’t believe they even fought as to
who would sell tickets at the door on the night of their jointly given
pledge dance. Have they just become friends for the moment, so
that a “bigger and better’’ dance can be given or are the natures of
sophomores being metamorphosed. “Things have changed since I
was in school," says the old grad when he hears of the corruption
of the spirit of the Rotary.	ffl ffi ffi ffl

The black shield of Score club with its golden XX’s will not
lock horns with the glowering Skull and gleaming crescent. They
will hang side by side and the athlete with the adhesive tape on his
thigh will count proceeds with the fellow who has tea-leaves on his
lip.

For a long time there has been drifting rumors as to an elimina-
tion of one or the other of the two sophomore honor societies. Which
one it would be no one has dared conjecture. In fact it has even
been said that there was no need for two organizations. There was
logic in the line of thought. The rivalry between the two organiza-
tions grew warm. But now this platonic turn of events I What does
it mean? Dare we suggest that it appears as if the two organiza-
tions would join forces? Does it look as if the two would combine
without pressure? We wonder.

Sidelights On
The Symphony

By Pearl Bloomfield

If the initial performance of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra is at
all indicative of the music we are
to hear during the rest of its pro-
grams, it is safe to predict a brilliant
musical season. ’ The orchestra is
surer of itself, if anything—more
perfect technically and expressional-
ly. And the selection of numbers—
one critic has said that a symphony
orchestra is nothing but a museum
of old masters. What would this
critic say about a program in which

scutz” in commemoration of the hun-
dred anniversary of the death of the
composer. The selection, based upon
an old German legend, was perfect-
ly presented with all of the compos-
er’s infinitely varied rhythm, his in-
telligence and imagination. From
the very beginning, the activities of
the horn transport us to the mysteri-
ous world of fairies, elves and
gnomes, and it is this instrument and

the clarinet that carry on the poetic
timbre.

The Franck “Symphony in B Min-
or” was a physical and emotional
strain. With its haunting opening
theme recurring again and again in
canons and inter-related keys until
one gnashes one’s teeth at its sudden
presentation “in the nude,” yet is
avid for more and more; the breath-
takingly abrupt changes in rhythm,
the constant modulation and varia-
tion—the symphony is enough in it-
self for a complete program. Straw-
inski’s “L’Oisseau de Feu” is a diz-
zying adventure into the land of
Phantasmagoria. The orchestra in-
terpreted brilliantly the uproar and
consequent crescendo of frenzy when
the monstrous figure of Kastchei ap-
pears; the climax of the Russian

in their own way Borodin's music.
The barbarian lack of restraint, the
abandon suited perfectly the now
languorous, now passionate music,
pulsing with rhythm, so admirably
adapted to dancing. It was a real
pleasure to be lost again in that
glorious abandon.

We are glod to have Mr. Stock and
his orchestra back with us, and hap-
pier to find his programs such musi-
cal feasts.

TOUCHBALL GAMES FAST; GOLF TOURNEY OPENS TODAY

DEKES, Pffl GAMS, PI LAMBDA PHI,
BELTS, AND PHI BETA DELTA TAKE
SNAPPY GAMES BY DECISIVE SCORES

U. of W. Has Frosh
Squad of 160 Men

Spectacular Passe* and Long Runs Feature Hard Play
Keyed Up By Winter Weather; Individual
Players Star

The first cool breezes of winter that
started to blow about the campus yes-
terday must have wdrked on the touch-
ball players in some subtle way, for
the league games were as nippy and as
snappy as the breezes themselves. The
men seemed to be up on their toes at
all times, ready to take advantage of
every break of the game. The result
was a series of fast, exciting games
with long runs and spectacular passes,
most of which were quite unexpected-
ly, completed. The most popular
place on the lot, though, seemed to be
the empty field next to the 59th Street
courts where an enormous bon-fire
blazed merrily.

Phi Betes Win

Phi Beta Delta started off the af-
ternoon’s contests with a 12 to 6 vic-
tory over Phi Delta Theta. The Phi
Delts made their tally after a series
of short passes one of which Metzel
finally carried over for a touchdown.
S. R. Blankenstein of the Phi B. D.’s
made a pretty run for a touchdown
on the kickoff and again figured in the
scoring when he passed to S. L. Blan-
kenstein for a second score.

Bartlett Stars

Phi Gamma Delta submerged Lamb-
da Chi Alpha in the second game by a
count of 18 to 0. Bartlett’s passing
was the outstanding feature of the
game. He tossed a 45 yard pass to
Shaffer for the Phi Gams first touch-
down and from then on kept up his
sensational work. His passing figured

largely in all the touchdowns that the
Phi Gams made.

Deke* Beat Delta Sigs

The rest of the games were all equal-
ly exciting. Delta Kappa Epsilon took
the measure of Delta Sigma Phi late
in the play. 18 to 6. The whole play
was fast 'and the playing was clear
cut. Cuthbertson made the final Deke
counter on one of the best runs of
the day when he reeled off fifty yards
on a dash around end.

Chi Psi’s Lose

Pi Lambda Phi kept their record
unblemished by downing the Chi Psi
machine, 6 to 0. The Pi Lam ponies
galloped all over the field with end
runs and finally scored on one. Debbs
chalked up the’ games lone marker
when he ran half the length of the
field throughout the whole Chi Psi
backfield. The Chi Psi’s completed
numerous passes but at no time did
they seriously threaten the victor’s
goal.

Delta Tau Delta outplayed Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, 24 to 6, in one of the
prettiest games on the schedule. A
sweet pass, Crawford to Wyant made
the first touchdown for the Delts. The
second touchdown was an exact repe-
tition of the first. Then Wyant .in-
tercepted a pass and through a beau-
tiful run made another score. Craw-
ford intercepted the next pass, then
threw to Marshall who scored the
fourth D. T. D. touchdown.

The University of Wisconsin
boasts a freshman football squad
of 160 youngsters, which, under the
direction of Coach Glen Holmes is
furnishing the varsity with real op-
position. This week,they have been
working on Hoosier plays and for-
mations secured by Badger scouts
who have been following Indiana.

Numbered among them are many
stellar prep school players.

A football league composed of
two yearling eleven, the All-Ameri-
can, a group of sophomores and in-
eligibles, and a team of physical ed-
ucation men have been formed to
provide Badger fans with grid
games when the varsity team is
performing abroad.

GOOD PROSPECTS

Prospects for a conference cham-
pionship water polo team and a good
swimming team this year are bright
according to Swimming Coach Mc-
Gillivray. All but three men from
last year’s team have reported for
practice and able swimmers from the
ranks of the'sophomores will fill the

vacancies.

FENCING CLASSES

Women’s fencing classes supervised
by W. A. A. have been resumed under
the direction of Dr. Alvar Hermanson.
The price will be $4.00 for eight les-
sons, to be paid at the first lesson to
Josephine Sibbald. She can be reach-
ed at Normal 3155.

Classes will meet in the corrective
gym on Mondays and Thursdays. The
hours are from 3:30 to 4:15 and from
4:15 to 5. Those who wish to join
may sign on the posters in the locker
room of Ida Noyes hall. The classes
will be limited to 20. and 10 members
are necessary in each class.

SIXTY-NINE WIRES
CARRIED PENN NEWS

The nation-wide interest that cen-
ters on the annual Penn-Chicago
game was made very evident to Milt
Kreines and Wallie Williamson, Bus-
iness Manager and Editor, respect-
ively, of The Daily Maoron, when
they took in that affair last Saturday.
They were honored with seats in the
press box of the Penn stadium and
by actual count found that there
were sixty-nine telegraph wires car-
rying play by play news of the
game to various places, and that at
least twenty-five men, representing
twenty-five of the foremost newspa-
pers of the nation were on hand to
write eye-witness stories of the
game.

at the Chicago-Wolverine water po-
lo game last year. Teams that will
be given places on the schedule are:
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa here
and Indiana, Illinois and Purdue
there.

Ed. Noyes, captain of this year’s
team will probably have as his team-
mates : Rittenhouse, Greenberg,
Hough, Harris, Lavezzario, Oker,
Mygdal, Crandal, Boyer, Campbell
and Olsen,

Although the Penn defeat was dis-
heartening, it did not mean any thing
in the conference win and lose col-
umn, and it is with this attitude that
the team should prepare for the Pur-
due game, the opening of the Big
Ten season for Chicago. Last Sat-
urday’s humiliating defeat was not
mentioned last night as the team
practised in the dark unil 6 o’clock,
the time limit set by conference of-
ficials.

Coach Stagg is working with both
the offense and defense. The fresh-
man again bucked the varsity with
Purdue plays. And they were suc-
cessful for the most part. Menden-
hall, the frosh flash from Terre
Haute, assumed the role of “Cotton”
Wilcox and did the latter justice;
for he ripped through the varsity for
several long runs that even the Penn
backs would not have been ashamed
to have negotiated. The few passes
that the yearlings attempted were
completed with respectable consist-
ency, but they were not the intricate
Purdue passes. The Frosh will re-
quire a little time to master tht Boi-
lermaker aerial game.

Every varsity man was given a
taste of active scrimmage. Hoerger,
McKinney, and K. Rouse are still
suffering from injured legs. The drill
was topped" with, a lecture by Stagg
of Purdue’s formations and a short
signal practice.

Call any time at the Bookstore for

THE DAILY MAROON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1926

THE FIRST REPLY TO OUR RE-
INCARNATED POLICY

Turk:

I think that this is a wistful thing
by Edna St. Vincent Millay—
“I might as well be easing you
As lie alone in bed,
And spend my life in wanting
A cruel, dark head.

You might as well call yours
What never can be his—
And one of us be happy;
There’s few enough as is.

—clipped by The Dead Soldier

THE orchestra which plays at the
Trianon is going to render the en-
cores for the Score Club, Skull and
Crescent dance. There’s nothing like
making the boys feel at home!

HOW DO GIRLS CLUBS RUSH
ANYHOW?

“What’s the name, Umplawheim-
er? I’m certainly glad to meet you,
Umpleashecmer, old girl. How do
you like our little dive here? We’re
glad to see a nice husky bim like
you entering our school. S’pose you
are going out for hockey, ain’t you?
Well, let me introduce you to Sadie
Schmalz—she’s the whole works over
at Ida Noyes these days you know.
Say, with your build and her drag
you’ll make it like a pipe.

I guess you’ve been looking over
the freihpien men, haven’t you?
Some good looking yokels on campus
this quarter. We’ll have to see what
we can pick up among them. Well,
here comes the rest of the crew, let’s
crawl over there and see what they
have got to offer in the way of food.”

A Daughter’s Day Would Being the
Sons Around Faster!

Dear Turk:

Teddy Linn in the throes of call-
ing the roll in English 247:

“Keutzer,” he called. No answer.

“Isn’t Keutzer chairman of the
Father’s Day?” The class answered
in the affirmative. ‘‘Well,” said Ted-
dy, “We ought to get up a Son’s
day somedoy so that a few of these
sons can get around once in a while
and see how the old school is con-
ducted !”

—Pooky

A quarter of a hundred Mortar
Board pins out on campus. They
seem, at last, to be going national!

MY REASONS

You wonder why I like you so?
There are many reasons.

First, because you are intriguing as
the year

Whose moods are couched within the
changing seasons.

In your smile there’s spring; cold
winter’s in your sneer.

Then, too, 1 love the graceful light-
ness of your dancing.

When music plays and you are folded
in my ars

I feel as though some messenger
from heaven is enhancing

My very life. Yet that is but the
fragrance of your charms.

And last, I am enamored with the
way you drink orangeade.

For you are gifted with the faculty
to pluck, with calm, aesthetic
poise,

The straw from out the glass at just
the proper moment . . .

so divinely made . . ■
And thus avoid the sad result of rash
delay—that awful gurgly noise!

—GeoG

REPORTS from the Illini home-
coming include the announcement
that eight hundred freshmen tried
out for basketball. At Northwest-
ern, no doubt, the semester pur-
chase will include some sprightly tos-
sers. At Chicago, glory be, the fra-
ternity horseshoe teams look as
strong as ever!
