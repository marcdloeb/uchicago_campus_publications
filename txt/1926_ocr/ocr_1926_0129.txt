Football playing develops male
beauty. Thia was conclusively proved
today when the semi-final figures for
the "Handsome Man” contest were
revealed. Three of the four leading
men are members of the football
team and the fourth belongs to the
fraternity that won the 1926 touch-
ball championship of the University
and 59th Street.

“Five Yards” McCarty has at last
come into his own. Not since last
football season has he been so glort-

tied. 571 loyal supporters have clut-
tered up the Maroon office to cast
their ballots, and although the judges
did their best to kep him out of the
leading position the Fiji political ma-
chine was too strong for them.

Fred Hobachied, who wears no
man’s collar because he can’t get any
of them on, was forced into second
position by the avalanche of McCarty
votes. Phi Psi rooters wrote ballots
desperately but to no avail.

For awhile during the afternoon
the Maroon staff was forced to bar-
ricade the office to keep supporters
of John Meyer from voting for him,
even though he has withdrawn from
the race. Most of the voters were
of the so called weaker sex but the
Maroon editors report that great dif-
ficulty was experienced in keeping
their votes from the columns.

Slim Granquist and oDn McGinnis,
the only class A entries, are still run-

American students.

Several women will speak on their
experiences as students in America.

SCHOLARSHIPS
TO AMERICANS

Given in Appreciation of
American Aids

Twenty-two scholarships are of-
fered to American sStudents by
French universities for 1926-27 it
was announced by G. J. Laing, Dean
of the Graduate School of Arts and
Literature, yesterday. Application
should be sent directly to the Secre-
tary of the Committee on Franco-
American Exchange of Scholarships
at any of the commissioning univer-
sities.

The scholarships are open to both
men and women in most cases, Amer-
ican born, under thirty years of age,
graduates of a college or university
approved by the American Council
on Education, and possessed of a
French.

Handsomest Man
Doesn’t Exist for

Walter Sargent

“It is impossible for me to give a
description of him whom I consider
the campus’ most handsome man.
There isn’t such a man,” said Walter
Sargent, chairman of the Art depart-
ment, yesterday when importuned by
a Maroon reporter desiring his ar-1
tistic opinion in the settlement of the
contest which is searching for the
campus Apollo.

"Impossible,” he repeated, “to se-
lect any one man as the most hand-
some in a group because in this same
group there will be types and types,
and the man-perfection of one type
is quite unlikely to conform to the
requirements of another. Physical
perfection, spiritual and intellectual
beauty—there is no common basis on
which to compare them. Therefore if
one type is preferred, it must be
through the personal preference of
the judge, not through his superiority
over the others.

FRESHMEN WOMtN

SERVE TEA SUNDAY

Freshman Women’s club members
will gather around the fireside for a
party Sunday from 4 to 6 in the Y.
W. C. A. room of Ida Noyes hall.
Lois Russell of campus vaudeville
fame will sing a few numbers and
Joanna Downs will give some read-
ings.

According to Ruth Norman, chair-
man of the Freshman Women’s coun-
cil, this social gathering for the
women will give them an opportunity
to become better acquainted with each
other. All freshmen women and their
friends have been invited.

By Rese H. Price

(This is the first of a series of arti-
cles which will discuss some advances
lately undertaken in college educa-
tion. There sems to be at present
among the undergraduates of Amer-
ica a certain vague uneasiness, a faint
stirring, whihe may possibly be inter-
preted as the first move toward an
open discussion and criticism of the
present-day methods of education in
these institutions. These articles will
endeavour to present a few of the
plans and purposes of some of the
leading universities of the country,
in their initial steps toward a con-
structwe program of a higher educa-
tional method.)

"What is the matter with our col-
leges?” has been the hue and cry of
the popular journals for the past sev-
eral years. The subject has grown
in interest, has been studied intensive-
ly, has been debated and discussed
pro and con, until even these silent
men behind the ivy-covored walls of
the colleges, those men who have been
faced with exactly that problem, al-
though in a positive rather than a
negative manner, have heard the jour-
nalistic uproar. A bit surprised, per-
haps, that their life-work should have
become so suddenly a matter for pub-
lic discussion and concern, they have
have turned from their labors to at-
tempt to clarify the situation for the
benefit of those feverish writers who
have been so busily damning the “ed-
ucation system.”

Unfortunately, however, for all
their explanations and attempts to
present academic matters to the pub-
I lie at large, their words have re-
| reived little recognition from those
to whom they were addressed. The
average person has better and more
frequent access to the weekly and
monthly journals which have raised
the question of the progress of the
colleges and universities of the coun-
try, than to those pamphlets and book- j
lets which have been the product? of
the men who really know and can ex-
plain the situation.

OFFER VARIETY OF
STUNTS IN INTER.

HALL VAUDEVILLE

Stunts varying from "Hints About
a Bear” to a dramatization of Mother
Goose rhymes in French will be of-
fered at the inter-hall vodvil, Wed-
nesday, February 10, according to
an announcement made yesterday by
Kathleen Bimrose, chairman of the
campffs community committee of the
Y. M. C. A., in charge of the pro-
gram.

Tickets are now on sale at the dor-
mitories, and may be purchased from
members of the campus community
committee, Miss Bimrose states. Bet-
sy Farwell is in charge of ticket
sales.

A number of committees have been
selected, and chairman are announced
as follows: music, Mary Fasset; light-
ing, Marie Thiele; state properties,
Elizabeth Garrison.

Candy will be sold, Miss Bimrose
states, and Dorothy McCoy, chairman
of the finance committee, will have
charge of the sales.

SERVICE GROUP HEARS
TALK ON SETTLEMENT

Freshman Council
to Meet Tuesday

The new Freshman Student Coun-
cil will hold the first meeting Tues-
day at 2:30 on the second floor of
Classics. Plans for several class and
inter-class social functions will be dis-
cussed. ।

A Social Service supper under the
auspices of the Volunteer Service
committee of the Y. W. C. A. will be
held Tuesday at 6 in the sun parlor of
Ida Noyes hall. A Settlement worker
will speak.

All those who wish to become ac-
quainted with the University Settle-
ment work have been invited to at-
tend Volunteer activities including
clubs, games and gymnastics, will be
explained. Tickets for the dinner may
be procured at the Y. W. C, A. office
any time before Tuesday for fifty
cents.

-In Which We

Begin a Defense

RALPH CONNOR GIVES
BOOKS TO HITCHCOCK

Students living in Hitchcock hall
were agreeably surprised with the
contents of yesterday morning’s
mail. For the mailman delivered
a package containing a complete
autographed set of Ralph Connor’s
works, each book containing a nov-
el quotation by the author.

The reason for the noted au-
thor’s generosity is explained by
the fact that he was the guest at
Hitchcock during the recent week-
end when he spoke at the Univer-
sity Sunday services.

Ralph Connor in the ordinary
pursuits of life is Dr. Charles W.
Gordon and lives in Winnipeg,
Canada. He is the writer of a
great number of modern novels,
among which are “The Sky Pi-
lot,” “The Man from Glengarry,”
“The Foreigner,” and “Black
Rock.”

AUTUMNGRADES
READY AT COBB

Students Advised to Get
Course Books Today

To France

Course books and grade cards for
the autumn quarter are ready for dis-
tribution, and may be obtained today,
an announcement from the office of
the recorder states. Students are re-
quested to call and obtain their books
without delay, during the hours desig-
nated by the recorder.

The books may be secured at the
bureau of records, Cobb lecture hall,
room 102, today between 9 and 12
o’clock and between 2 and 4 o’clock.
Those who do not get their books to-
day may obtain them on other days
during the regular office hours of the
bureau. 10 to 12 o’clock and 2 to 3
o’clock.

The recorder is- Very anxious to
have students get the books at once
and urges all to call.at the earliest
possible time.

PLAN TO PUBLISH
LIST OF AUTUMN
PHI BETE GRADES

How many undergraduates made
Phi Beta Kappa grades during the
last quarter will be revealed in detail
Tuesday, according to Walter A.
Payne, Recorder-Examiner of the
University.

“We have subjected the past quar-
ter’s scholarship to a more extensive
analysis than we have ever before
done,” declared Mr. Payne today. “By
the first part of next week we shall
have prepared for publication in The
Daily Maroon comprehensive lists of
those students who have made three
A’s and those who made two A’s and
a B. Their names will also be pub-
lished. Along with these there will
be the number of undergraduates
earning an A and two B’s.*

Scholarship among undergraduates
shows a decided improvement this
quarter, particularly in the colleges
of Arts, Literature and Science, ac-
cording to many employees in the Re-
corder’s office. It is believed that the
increase of scholarships has inspired
better work among the students.

Second Tryout For
Mirror Held Today

—	X

A second tryout for positions in
the cast and chorus of the First An-
nual Mirror production will be held
today at 3:30 in the theater of Ida
Noyes hall. All women interested
have been requested to appear.

AIR COMPLETE
LIST OF SENIOR
CONDEMNATIONS

Ail Phases of University Life
Get Share Of

Criticism

In an effort to air all of the views
of the Seniors concerning the Uni-
versity, the following list of griev-
ances is published:

Cigarettes should be on sale in the
Reynolds club; better P. €. should
be provided for women, better instruc-
tion in elementary courses should be
offered, more reference books and bet-
ter service should be available at Ell.

Suggest National Sororities

Apparently many women would like
to see national sororities introduced.
This suggestion occurred many times,
and all seemed to feel that it would
make for a better spirit among the
women here.

Many criticisms of the educational
technique of the University occurred.
The caliber of instruction in the ele-
mentary courses was repeatedly con-
demned, some feeling that the young
instructors who teach these courses
lack knowledge and personality. Final
examinations were ridiculed by some,
while others felt that they could be
eliminated from many courses.

Condemn Publication*

The Cap and Gown and The Maroon
caused a great deal of criticism—
chiefly condemnatory. Some of the
complaints said that neither were a
credit to the school, and that both
ought to be improved or suspended.
The .Maroon’s editorials came in for
the most criticism.

Several papers suggested the or-
ganization of a department of music,
while others contained requests for a
regular department of dramatics with
a little theater in connection for ex-
perimental work. Some suggested
that this department be modeled after
the one now functioning at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota.

Disapproves of Tocques

The "rah-rah” publicity the Univer-
sity sometimes comes in for was con-
atmned and the wearing of tocques
was ridiculed in many papers. One
person said: “the atmosphere of the
University ought to be such that con-
tests such as the one the Maroon is
now conducting ought to be impos-
sible.”

CULLOM ADDRESSES
GREEN CAP CLUB IN

BANQUET TONIGHT

With its charter roll cut to sixty-
five by non residence of members, the
Green Cap Club is planning its second
banquet tonight at 6 in Hutchinson
Coffee Shop. Fred Mudge, president,
promises that it will be over in time
to allow the members to attend the
track interscholastic.

Paul Cullom, abbot of Blackfriars
and head of Intramurals, and Der-
wood Lockard, president of Score club,
will discuss campus activities with
those attending. A determined effort
is being made by the officers of the
club to make every Green Cap man
an activities man and thus make the
club a real power in the class.

Dean Wilkins who originally plan-
ned to speak, of course can not do so.

Open discussion will be held on
campus interest. It is already known
that members are attending bringing
up the subject of tocques and of the
possibility of a club dance.

Rainey Bennett will provide an or-
chestra for the occasion. Arthur Col-
lat, chairman of the entertainment
committee will provide several num-
bers.

Tickets will be on sale at the door
for those who have not purchased
them beforehand.

MR. WEATHERMAN, HAVE SOME PITY

TF grade curve falls low this quarter we shall be inclined to think
-L that it is the result of the low temperature curve. Our fingers
are all thumbs and the women have accused us of using rouge.

When we went into the Daily Maroon office yesterday after-
noon we found even the members of the women’s department smok-
ing — at last that was the illusion. As a matter of fact the room
was so cold that the entire staff had to wear overcoats while editing
this paper.

To this unrasonable (though perhaps not unseasonable)
weather we place all blame for our not making the eight o’clock
this morning. Also it is responsible for our illegible notes in all
of our classes.

This is a matter about which the undergraduate council might
.very easily pass some resolutions, and about which the women’s
physical culture department could easily draft some new rules.

At least, attending the University these days is disagreeable and
is only made bearable when we pass, on our way to class, the half
■frozen workmen on the new chapel, whose classes meet out of doors.

AS CALENDAR MAKERS WE’RE INEFFICIENT

'T'HIS year’s social program is outstanding for the large number
-* of conflicting dates that have arisen. The social director, Mrs.

Robert V. Merrill, has had to act as a sort of mediator between
organizations whose principal events seem to be scheduled for the
same time. Each group claims the preference, saying that the event

in question is traditional, and has always
ximate date.

The conflict might easily be avoided,
crowd all affairs into the last month of

occurred at that appro-

There is a tendency to
the quarter, rather than

extend them throughout the entire term. There must of a necessity
be a conflict, because certain week ends are always more desirable
than others, and several organizations wish to schedule their events
for these particular days. Why could not the month of January,
devoid of any dates, be utilized for one or two events the with-
drawal of which might make the February and March calendar less
crowded, and more interesting?

These self same events, when not placed in such close proxim-
ity to each other, will also appear more important in the eyes of the
campus, than they do now, completely overshadowing one another.

In making out the social program for next year, let us keep in
mind this year’s situation, and profit by the experience of those who
failed to take into consideration the plans of others. Extend your
events evenly and sanely. If necessary, break a tradition. It may
avoid the breaking of a date.

BADGER JUMPING
ACE IS BUDDING
RECORD BREAKER

formance of the Badger jumping ace
last Saturday can well warrant, the
above assertion.

Before the entire Badger track
coaching staff, the Wisconsin jump-
er, a close and ardent pupil of Coach
T. E. Jones accomplished a feat that
perhaps cannot be done by any other
jumper in the world. Using the four
legitimately recognized forms of high
jumping, McGinnis reached a height
of better than six feet in each and
shattered the Armory Annex record
with a style of jumping that is new to
him.

Starting the trial with the old scis-
sors form, McGinnis cleared the bar
at 6 feet 1 inch. His second effort was
was a half Sweeney jump and pushed
the bar up an inch to 6 feet 2 inches.
Using his regular form of jumping,
the style which has made him one of
the best in the western conference,
the Sweeney jump, McGinnis success-
fully negotiated 6 feet 4 inches.

To cap this climax, and to the sur-
prise of all present, McGinnis with
the Western style of getting over the
bar, broke the record of “Pete” Plat-
ten. His mark with this effort raised
the bar again and the official meas-
urement by Coach Jones was 6 feet
4 3-3 inches. McGinnis is jumping his
second year for Wisconsin and under
the tutelage of Coach Janes has devel-
oped the finest kind of form and coor-
dination. It is expected that the Bad-
ger ace will set a mark of 6 feet this
spring. Besides high jumping McGin-
nis is a fine hurdler.

TONIGHTS MEET

Many postponements cut into the
Intramural cage program last night,
but the games that were played made
up in excitement and interest for
those that were not. Only six of the
eleven contests planned were played,
but included in these were several
undefeated teams and favorites in the
league races now coming to a close.
The reason for the cancellation of so
many games was the holding of pro-
bation week by most of the fratern-
ities at this time.

A. T. O, Show Cla**

A championship brand of team
work was shown by the A. T. O.’s in
their game with the Z. B. T.’s, which
they won by the decisive score of 32
to 11. During the first half of the
fray the teams appeared to be evenly
matched, both putting up stiff defense.
It was anybody’s victory at the end of
this period, with the count 7 to 6 in
the favor of the A. T. O.’s But when
the whistle blew for the second half,
the A. T. O. quintet unleashed a fer-
ocious attack and scored eight points
before the Zotes could make a counter.,
From there on the winners had things
their own way, as they evidenced by,
securing eight more baskets in the
last five minutes of play. It is a safe
prophesy to say that if the A. T. O.’s
keep up the pace they set last night
the championship cup will surely
rest upon their mantle.

Delta Tau Delta won a close contest
from Tau Sigma Omricon 20 to 16.
Bus O’Keefe and Healy of the Dolts
and Nieman of the loosers got three
buckets apiece. Close guarding by
both teams forced the game into a
long shot contest which proved slight-
ly to the advantage of the Delt sharp-;
shooters. Both teams played without
a substitution, the individual bril-
liancy of all the men starting the
game keeping them in the battle till
the hard fought end of the game.

Phi Kappa Sigma cinched the cham-
pionship of Beta League by winning
from Chi Psi in a 8 to 2 game fea-
tured by close guarding.

Green and Kelly Win

Women’s Basket Tilts

Green swamped Drexel with a
score of 28 to 16 and Kelly defeated
Greenwood 11 to 9 after a hard fight
on Wednesday, Jan. 27, in women’s
basketball. These were the first re-
gular inter-hall games of the season,
although there have been several
practice games before this. The re-
fereest were Miss Wylie and Miss
Green, both P. C. instructors. Next
Wednesday Green will play Green-
wood and Kelly will play Drexel at
7 p. m. in Ida Noyes hall.

Excellent form was shown by all
the teams considering the fact that
it is so early in the season, and all
four teams seem to be about evenly
matched with a good chance for any
one of them to win the championship.
Mildred Dye of Greenwood was the
star of the Greenwood-Kelly game, as
she scored all of their 9 points, and
Green’s six all played very good bas-
ketball with excellent teamwork.

Miss Alma Wylie, who is in charge
of the tournament says, “These
games are very interesting to watch,
and more people ought to come out
and cheer their favorites.’*

WHAT o/IT?

^toi^t MOSfiEN5Ttf\N

Being one of those “hall boys”—
I live in dear old Hitchcock—I am
considerably annoyed by all this cold
weather that has been accumulating

during the last couple of days,
walls of the old place are
enough, God wot, but still the
cold wind has a disagreeable

The
thick
cold,
habit

of whistling all over, around and
through the place. The radiators,
owing to the university’s economic
policy, are never so effective as to
make the room unbearably hot, and,
worse yet, they are shut off at the
curfew-hour.

All this I could stand, but when
the blankets are a couple of feet shy
of what they ought to be in length, I
feel, though a long-suffering man,
that it is time to rebel. I do not,
understand, mind these short-length
affairs in warm weather, but in such
times as these they do not readily

lend themselves either

to heat or

comfort. Either (I blush to discuss
these little intimate things right out
in public like this, but then . . .) one’s
feet are warm and one’s neck ex-
posed, or one’s Adam’s apple is
shrouded from the wintry blasts and
one’s dogs go cold. This is indeed
lamentable.

I laid in wait for Joe, the self-
sacrificing and incorruptible hall
man-of-all-work. the other day, desir-
ing to put my predicament before
him. “Joe,” said I when he came in
to make those mystical passes with
a dust-cloth without which his con-
science could not be clear, “Joe, I
have something to say to you. Sit
down, Joe,” I continued, waving him
into a chair, in the manner of Sher-
lock Holmes, so that the strong morn-
ing light fell full on his face, while
I sat back masked in the gloom. I
then outlined the mysterious Affair
of the Short Blankets.

“Well, sir,” , '‘plied Joe when I had
quite done, “there ain’t a good deal
to be done about it. The university
supplies them blankets, and there
ain’t nothing I can do but put ’em on
the beds. They’s army blankets,”

Tom Eek’s indoor tracksters will
negotiate considerable , distance be-
fore this evening is through as they
meet Indiana’s representative board-
men in Bartlett gymnasium tonight.

Now that the Maroons deliber-
ately went and undoped all the
dope by being trimmed by Minne-
sota, it is up to Ohio State to take
its turn at upsetting the dope. By
all logic it seems that if the Ma-
roons were unable to hold the
comparatively weak Gophers to 20
points, the high pressure Buck-
eyes should score many more than

It will
year.

The

be their first dual meet of the

Eck Not Worrying
venerable old coach refused

to comment on the Maroons’ chances
in the meet, but it is well-known
around track circles that very little
has occurred during practice to
arouse his cutting criticism while
some of the performances turned in
have caused him to chuckle. From
all indications Chicago should have
little to worry about tonight except
the breaking of some few records.

However, the invaders boast of a
crack 50-yard sprinter who is ex-
pected to win this event. Pepper of
the Hoosiers makes the dash regular-
ly in the time of 5 and 5-10 sec-
onds. Filian is also counted on to
make some points for Indiana in the
hurdles. The Maroons will take care
of the high jump in the proper man-
ner as Berg and Cody, Eek’s entries,
have been scaling the bar at perilous
heights. Harrison and the popular
Hobschied will toss the brass ball in
competition with a number of former
Indiana football men.

Cu*ack Out for Records

Captain Cusack is practically sure
to come through in his events, the
mile and the half-mile. Pressed by
competition he s expected to smasn
some records of long standing. Hego-
vic and Owens should worry Horner,
Indiana’s best-two-miler, a good deci
before the race is over.

The Maroon entries are as follows:
L. E. Smith, hurdles and dash; Beall,
Armstrong, Baker, 440 yard run; J.
Cusack, Kelso, Benton 880, yard run;
Dugan, Kent, Cusack, mile; Betts,

that and thus win handily,
basketball isn’t logical.

If the Norgrenites can
“Cookie” Cunningham, as

But

stop
they

failed to stop Spradling and Rasey,
then Chicago may wallop the Col-
umbus eagers. The Buckeyes
miss Johnny Miner but they have
a little fellow named Dempsev
who has the unfortunate habit of
running wild whenever Cunning-
has an off night. If the double
coincidence of Sackett halting
“Cookie’s” baskets and Dempsey
having a bad evening occur, Chi-
cago should win. But since this
seems unlikely, our predictions
are:

Ohio State, 23; Chicago, 20.

SKATE CARNIVAL

ENTRIES CLOSE

Entries close today for the first an-
nual Intramural Ice Carnival, which,
will be held in the Washington Park
Lagoon on February 4th and 5th. The
meet, which will be the first of its
kind in this school, promises to be a
thrilling one for contestant and spec-
tator alike. All that remains to as-
sure the success of the affair is the
completion of the entry list.

Fraternity entries are coming in
fast, but the women and unorganized
men seem a little reticent. The big
list of events and the splendid prizes
offered should invite a fast and color-
ful field for the winter classic. Man-
ager Engberg and his assistants have
spared no effort to have eve y facility
for the two-day contest and all that
remains to be done is to have the un-

KoeiHgsburg, Hegovic, Owens, two organizeu nyers anu worn

APPOINT BEASANT TO
AID COACH MERRILL
WITH FENCING CLASS

Coach A. A. Stagg announces the
appointment of Gene Beasant as in-
structor in fencing to aid Coach Mer-
rill in initiating an interest in fenc-
ing. Anyone now taking P. C. for

credit can transfer to this

new fenc-

ing class by applying to Dr. Reed.
The class is at 4:00 o’clock.

‘Coach Merrill declared that the
University will provide all equipment.
“At Illinois,” declared Coach Merrill,
“There are over 170 students taking
part in intramural fencing, we wish
to start this worthwhile sport to the
student body here.”

The fencing team at present lacks
experienced men due to the gradu-
ation of Spivak, Margolis, and Amick,
last year’s Conference champs. Illi-
nois comes here Feb. 5 to meet Chi-
cago and a close contest is expected.
The men on the team are Capt. Scar-
ry in the saber, Kerr, Graves, and
Daugherity in the foils and Graves in
the duelling swords. All men are
urged to tryout for the team.

THE TURK is still rehearsing for
his Playfest—at least that is the ex-
cuse he gives for not appearing in
the Maroon Office today. But, judg-
ing from the weather conditions, and
knowing the frailty of his physical
make-up, we believe differently. The
Dear Old Boy is probably standing in
the outside vestibule of his Frater-
nity House, with two pledges on
either side of him rubbing away at
his frozen ears, two more running in
and out replenishing buckets with
snow for the masseurs, and a fourth
nearby, ready to apply a handker-:
chief to the tender nose whenever I
necessity arises!!

AND YET we can not blame him
for keeping away from the Maroon •
office. As we write this article little
drops of frozen tears drop from our
eyebrows to the swollen blister on
the end of our nose, in sympathy for
the suffering that is going on around
us. Over in one corner of the room,
little George Jones is warming his,
numbed fingers above the black coals
of a slowly smouldering fire. Crouch-
ed near him in blank despair is the
pathetic figure of Walt Williamson,;
desperately trying to gain the last i
drop of heat from the frozen remains
of Herb DeYoung and his fur coat.;
And over us. poor, sweet Al Widdi-
field is clinging to the electric light
bulb, with the vain hope that he may
become somewhat tepid. Foolish
boy—does he not know that glass is
not a conductor of heat? It is im-
possible to write humor in these sur-
roundings. Would I were a Chopin
that I might compose a funeral
march!

(He’s Taking Hot Lemonade Seven
Time* Daily.)

Dear Sir:

I am denly interested in the fact:
that Terrible Turk has been absent i
from the Maroon office for the last
two days. More than that—I am wor-
ried ! Is it possible that he has
frozen his tonsils, and will not be
able to talk in the Playfest? At
least, make him promise to appear?
regardless of whether or not he will
be able to speak. You know, I have
always wanted to find out just why
he has such power over women, and
I have never had the pleasure of see-
ing him personally. He must be
there!	—Iris

TANK POLO STILL

ON EXPERIMENT

Conference soccer water polo is one
of the newest sports offered to the
Big Ten schools for competition and
being in its embryonic stage it will
take a great deal of experimenting be-
fore the game is played as it “should
be played.” It is the opinion of the
experts of this game that fhe IT of C
and Northwestern are the only two
Conference squads that play the game
correctly.

Michigan just recently drowned Indi-
ana in a rough and tumble contest and
it was so much like its ancestor Water

Basket Ball that the University Doc-i
tors threatened to bar the game. How-
ever. Indiana deserves credit for play-
ing a game which the water men had
no opportunity to practice, so that
this may account for its uncalled
for roughness.

Minnesota has not entered a team
in the Conference this year, which is ’
a set back to the game, for it needs j
the full support of all the schools in j
order to insure its successful debut. |

Coach La Bree of Purdue has gone j
his limit in establishing a clean brand
of Polo with his men. Purdue is
considered one of the strongest teams
in the race after the two Chicago
locals.

Illinois. Iowa and Wisconsin are
still considered dark horses by all in-

terested fans but are expected to re-
veal their strength within a short
time.

WHAT. OF IT?

(Continued from page 3)

said Joe, unerringly singling out the
one point that mattered (and, incid-
entally, clearing up the business at
one throb of that gigantic brain).
“They’s army blankets,” he repeated,
musing, “and there’s nothing to be
done.” With that he went off, first
however, making his passes with the
cloth. Of course, I know there ain’t
anything to be done, but still I wish
that if anyone knows how these here
warming-pans work, or where you
can can get them, he would notify
64 Hitchcock at his earliest conve-
nience.

to pick up some easy money on the
side. —Paoky

IN CLOSING we advise you all to
see the Playfest. There must be
something to a show that will recog-
nize the histrionic ability of Terrible
Turk. Then too, we all enjoy bur-
lesques ! —GEOG

Making Progress In School

Calls for a sturdy well nourished body. Students need the
full advantage of a quart a day of Borden’s Selected Milk.
It is the most in pure food for the least money.

Have Strong Offense

Like Purdue it is a team which lays
heavy stress to their point-making
attack in the belief that a good of-
fense is also a strong defense. With
the Buckeye battle coming so close
behind the heels of the Gopher game
Coach Norgren has little time to
adapt his team to the invader’s parti-
cular style of play. But it is ex-
pected that the same sort of defense
which characterized the Maroons’
game against Purdue will be employ-
ed again tomorrow night. That
means that Cunningham will have
considerable attention while his team
mates will not be exactly slighted.

The Maroons will take the coming
fray quite seriously as the result will
practically make or break them. Al-
yea and McDonough still have their
shooting streaks coming to them and
if they should crop out now, the
Bucks will be in for a heated busi-
ness session.

THE QUESTION

And do I love you?
That I cannot say—
Although I miss you
When you’re away.
I think about you—
But others too,
I like your ways, dear
But they’re not new.
The Washington Prom?
Why, certainly!!

“WASHINGTON PROM Tickets
Ready For Fraternity Heads,” read-
the Maroon Headline. We knew it,
we knew it. Deep into our pockets
go our hands, and out comes six hun-
dred and sixty pennies. What good
does it do a person to resolve at the
beginning of the year not to chew
gum and to save the nickels he might
have spent—when inside of two
months he gets stuck anyway?

The Turk Will Probably Be
Interested

Sir:

Having heard that they were going
to limit the use of cigarettes by
co-eds, I immediately went down to
the Civil Service Commission and
took the examination for a position
as smoke inspector. Now sir, since
they mark fifty-two per cent on the
first question—“What experience
have you had?’’—I would suggest
that here is an opportunity for you
