MAROON WEEK
STARTS DOINGS

WITH ‘SPECIAL’

Bi-Weekly Literary Supple-
ment Makes Appear-
ance Tomorrow

Maroon Week, second annual edi-
tion, began yesterday afternoon with
a tea in Ida Noyes. Miss Burtis,
chairwoman of the week, organized
her thirty-five workers into four
teams at this affair and outlined
plans for the drive.

The first issue of the new literary
supplement will appear on the cam-
pus tomorrow to feature the week.
Special local color articles have been
promised by well-known campus
writers. It is rumored that vers
libre is to be much in the minority
and special articles on the strange
habits of collegians in the majority.

Subscribe in Chapel

Miss Burtis plans to take subscrip-
tions in Chapel each day this week
and has arranged that Thomas Mul-
roy, business manager of the Daily
Maroon shall speak. Prominent cam-
pus women, workers on the four com-
mittees headed by Katherine Rose,
Betsy Farwell, Helen Lamborn and
Ruth DeWitt will be stationed at

eon and Miss Burtis will receive re-(
ports of the progress that has been
made and will outline plans for the
rest of the week. The drive will
close after the Maroon Mixer which
will be held in both lounges of the
Reynolds club Friday afternoon from
4 to 6.

Under Miss Burtis’ system of four

parts of the campus will he covered

when the drive closes Friday no per-
son who has not subscribed to The
Daily Maroon will have been missed
by the workers

“This campaign,” said.Miss Burtis,
“is being conducted so that the Ma-
roon, the campus organ of publicity,
may reach all students. In this way
even more members of the Univer-
sity will be made conversant with
current activities.”

‘‘EDUCATION IN RUSSIA
TOPIC FOR BRITISH
LECTURER

Dr. Lloyd Storr-Best of England

will speak today at
Assembly room on
Soviet Russia.” He
der the auspices of

4:30 in Harper
“Education in
is lecturing un-
the Institute of

Internation Education.

Besides being a lecturer Dr. Best
is also one of the most profound of
English scholars. He graduated from
the University of London where he
received the M.A. and D.Litt. degrees.
He studied at Cambridge, Paris, Sor-
bonne and Rome. At the present
time he is a member of the joint ex-
amining board of the five northern
universities of England, External As-
sessor (Classics) of the M.A. Theses
for the University of Manchester,
and Headmaster of the Firth Park
Secondary School, in Sheffield.

He is also the outhor of “Varro On
Farming,” Translation with Excur-
sus, textual criticism, commentary
and notes; “ A Roman Farmstead”;
and “The Tempest” edited (1923) for
Christopher’s; many magazine art-
icles ana reviews in the Classical
Quarterly and elsewhere.

CAMPUS GETS “HOT*
OVER MAROON WEEK

Maroon week, long heralded as
a gala period in the history of the
campus, has commenced. Vast
amounts of tea were disposed of in
Ida Noyes to mark the occasion
and as the bonfires were lighted
on the steps of Cobb groups of
playful undergraduates danced in
the circle, overcome by realization
of the Maroon’s services to the
University.

, But in spite of all these little
dissipations Maroon week hasn’t
caused any great changes about
the campus. Bonfires don’t keep
people away from the steps of
Cobb. Dancing doesn’t change
the appearance of the circle
greatly.

You see, Maroon week isn’t
really a carnival time. It’s just a
snappy name some one over in the
office thought up for the spring
subscription drive. That’s the rea-
son for all the heavy publicity in
the local press. You may be ac-
costed by some young thing trying
to sell you a subscription, but
apart from that this week will
pass just as any other.

BAR^STARS AT

No

down-town stage celebrities

will attend the annual Sophomore-
Freshmen Promenade at the Hyde
Park hotel next Friday night. This
was the announcement made last
night by the leaders. The “stars”
are barred.

“The dance,” said Hein King, ‘is
given in a strict campus sense.” The
councils of the two classes have
stressed the idea of having either a
Freshman or a Sophomore in each
couple. With this arrangement they
hope to keep the dance an inter-class
activity.

PHOENIX BOASTS OF
FAMOUS HUMORISTS
IN COMING FEATURES

Stephen Leacock, one of the best
known humorists of the country, has
contributed to the Phoenix that will
come out later in this month. Al-
though he is a regular contributor
to the best known magazines pub-
lished today, his greatest success in
writing came with th? publication of
his hook, “Nonsense Novels.” McGill
University is the present location of
Mr. Leacock, where he is teaching!
Political Economy. He took one of
his higher degrees here at the Univer-
sity.

Babette Deutsch, a poetess of re-
nown, and one who also writes for
leading periodicals, has written, ac-
cording to Fred Handschy, a “hot
sketch,” a poem called “Persephone.”
He further announced that McClel-
land Barclay, an illustration, adver-
tising. and cover artist is the artist
that has drawn the cover, the por-
trait of a campus beauty.

FEDERATION PLANS
TEA FOR NEW
WOMEN

All

women who have entered

University this quarter will be
tertained by Federation at a

the
en-
tea

which will be given Thursday from 4
to 6 in the north reception room of
Ida Noyes hall. Federation council
members will act as hostesses on this
occasion, and both freshmen and en-
tering upperclasswomen have been in-
vited to attend.

“It has been impossible for us to
extend a personal invitation to every
woman who has entered this quar-
ter,” said Dorothy Kennedy, chair-
man of the organization. “We there-
fore want all incoming women to feel
that they have been cordially invited
to be present through this notice. We
are particularly anxious that every
entering woman attend.”

Gitta Gradova Plays
In Chapel Today

Gitta Gradova, “the foremost wo-
man pianist now before the public,”
makes her first appearance before a
University audience this afternoon at
4:15, in Mandel hall.

Born in Chicago of Russian par-
ents, Miss Gradova has been trained
in America, attaining to the fame of
an artist in her early youth. Her
repertoire is reputed to be the widest
of any living pianist.

“Blackfriars” production will be held
tonight at 7:30 in the Reynolds Club
theatre. All men students of the Uni-
versity who are eligible for public
appearance and who have aspirations
along the line of dramatics, are urged
to try out by Paul Cullom, Abbot of
“Blackfriars.”

The play this year offers opportun-
ity for a great variety of talent, ac-
cording to the authors, Walker Davis
and William Bager. There are two
female leads for those men who be-
lieve they have ability closely allied
to these of Julian Eltinge. There

Ceremony

While five hundred people filled its
halls in reverent silence, a new al-
tar to the quest for divine truth was
born yesterday.

The new theology building, said to
be the most beautiful structure of
its kind in the world, was formally
designated a part of the University
with the most dignified ceremonies
ever hid on the quadrangles. Savants
and scholars from all over the world

Tryout Method*

Although a number of stars from
previous productions are expected to
be present at the tryouts, Cullom
hopes that this fact will not discour-
age any men from presenting their
ability before the judges. The new
types in this year’s show, according
to Cullom, call for new material in
the tryouts, as they represent an en-
tirely different sort of character from
any of those heretofore presented.

Call Chorus Thursday

The chorus call will come Thurs-
day ^ftei;noon at 3 o’clock also in the
Reynolds Club theatre. The nature
of the play this year will demand an
unusually large chorus.

Science Profs

Four out of five American scient-
ists who in the last twenty years
have been entitled to the Nobel prize
in science for discoveries of great
benefit to mankind have been on the
faculty of the University a survey
made yesterday by the University)
shows. Three of these men have act-

fourth was conceded it recently.

In 1907 the award went to Prof.

tians, and, possibly, the character of
Moses, according to Prof. J. M. P.
Smith, scholar at the University.

Prof. Smith, an internationally

WE RE making a big racket, these days, about Maroon Week.

Perhaps you wonder why? Well, we’ll tell you; and wa
might as we might as well tell you the truth.

We won’t tell you, as the business manager did a year ago, that
Maroon Week is the Greatest Week of the Year. You might doubt
that. You are blase on this matter of weeks. You have been
through too many of them. You have had Apple Week, Promegran-
ite Week, and Candied-Watermelon-Rind Week; you have had
Hello Week, How-Are-You Week, and How’s Tricks Weeks. If
there is anything to know about weeks, you know it.

We won’t tell you that Maroon Week is our scheme for show-
ing the University a good time. You might not believe that, either.
You have bought (or narrowly escaped buying) too many copies of
The Phoenix; you have paid too many fines at Harper library; you
have even attended the Washington Prom. You know that philan-
thropists don’t operate this University of ours.

We won’t tell you that we are trying to make friends among the
students. You might ask what we are going to do with those
friends, once we have them. And then we would have to tell you
the whole truth—which you knew all the time—and which we are
now going to tell you anyhow.

Maroon Week is a scheme for getting more subscribers to The
Daily Maroon. We are honestly trying to show you a good time;
we are honestly trying to make friends among you who haven’t sub-
scribed in the hope that you will pay us your dollar.

But perhaps it isn’t just a matter of your paying us a dollar. Per-
haps you will gain something, too. Perhaps it’s worth a dollar to
you, to know what’s doing every day for the rest of the year—to
know who is elected to this office or that, and why (though some-
times even we can t tell you that); to read about Prof. Somebody s
latest startling discovery; to find out who beat whom in baseball,
tennis, and things like that; to laugh at jokes in The Whistle that
are not merely wise-cracks; and to read editorials by a man who is
trying to get through school before tuition goes up to $90. Perhaps
all this is worth the price; perhaps not. Find out; that is all we ask.
To make the question easier, we have drafted an army of sales-
women; we invite you to a mixer in the Reynolds club; and per-
haps, if you come to our office early enough tomorrow morning, you
can steal a Maroon.

Consider the problem well. You have one week—Maroon
Week—to decide.

for

the first time almost since the origin
of the annual scrap about the only
thing that remains to be done is the
picking of an all star team. The
team selected by this writer may sur-
prise some due to the large number
of teams represented that failed to
enter the semi-finals. However, the
men chosen represent the individual
star parformers of the tourney.

Wei ah Captains Squad

Undoubtedly the outstanding for-
ward of the meet was Welsh of
Westport who is selected on the first
team and who is given the captaincy
of the honorary five. He was a
wonderful offensive man, could drib-

mate for the Missourian,

from any
a running
Myllykam-

gas, the doughty captain df the cham-
pionship Fitchburg team is selected.
Not quite so flashy as Welsh, he was
every^bit as valuable to his team and
he always seemed to come through
with a field goal when it was needed.

Clark of Pueblo represented the
best of the pivot men. H>’ was a fast
dribbler, a good juniper, had a won-
derful shooting eye and in addition
was very cool headed. He was prac-

Possessed of an accurate

that the Kansas aggregation was able
to eliminate El Reno. He was also
a wonderful defensive man and one
could count on the fingers of one
hand the close-in shots that were made
against the Newton outfit. McNeece
the fighting guard of the Fargo team
is given the other position. He was
a factor in every game that his team

played and was able to start
ball down the floor better than
other guard in the tourney.

Maroon Track Stars

The Maroons will have at least four
stars and many lesser lights in the
Bankers’ Track meet late in the week
and Coaches Stagg and Stagg, Jr.,
are relying on the frosh especially to
annex a few firsts.

Dick Williams, Gist, and Burke are
the star yearlings who will compete
in the half mile while Capt. Cusack
will enter the mile. Anton Bifke,
Conference champion in the high
jump is expected to cop his specialty,
though he will have some keen com-
petition from the I. A. C. and C. A. A.
stars. Hobschied will perform in the
shot put and Beal may enter the
quarter.

I-M DEPARTMENT

RESUMES WORK

Plans are under way to start the
intramural athletic program for the
new quarter within the next week.
During the National Basketball In-
terscholastic, the Intramural depart-
ment was kept out of its office and
thus was prevented from continuing
its work. But now the department is
functioning once more and at present
the playground ball tournep and the
Spring Outdoor Carnival are in the
process of being planned for.

This carnival will be the feature
of the Spring quarter and will be held
at the beginning of June. The hand-
ball tourney, which was left over
from last quarter, will be continued
and the championship decided. Then
the Spring sports, tennis and play-
ground ball will be begun.

Dr. Molander wishes to announce
that all those who have medals due
them and who have not as yet re-
ceived them, should come to the In-
tramural office between 2 and 3 any
afternoon this week and get them.

AND SATURDAY

Practice in Mud1

strange sounds in staid old Stagg
field yesterday where usually the only
noise are the shrill cries of the quar-
ter backs and the deep cheers from
frenzied spectators. And the reason
for all of this new activity was that
yesterday workmen actually started
on the task of rejuvenating the old
stands to make the Chicago football
plant one of the largest and most
commodious in the country.

The me aster steam shovel with its
huge scot p took the first bite from
the surft ce soil yesterday morning
and all day long the scoop dug in
again and again until last night there
was much evidence of progress. The
surface soil was stripped from almost
half of the field and the excavated
soil was hauled away and piled in a
corner. All of the dirt that is dug
out has to be carefully saved, for the
present field is three feet higher than
the practice field and if the new field
is to be level all of the ground will
have to be filled in.

The work is progressing exceed-
ingly rapidly for such a large enter-
prise and the contractors have given
forth the cheering news that the
steel for the structural work will be
ready to put in in another month. The
first concrete forms are to be poured
within two weeks. There will have
to be much of the concrete work for
the new stands are to be set upon
piles. This is necessitated by the
facts that there is bad ground for
foundations and that the stand itself
will be very heavy.

Between thirty and forty ambit-

of Chicago Football Team of 1926,
met Mr. Stagg on his field yesterday
afternoon to start off the long drill
which is to be held this Spring.

It was very evident that Coach
Stagg meant business, as usual, when
he issued a call for spring practice,
by what he prescribed for the pig-
skin chasers in yesterday’s opening
session. After limbering the boys

consisted of kicking the dozen or so

No Tackling

The players were divided into
groups, and the groups alternated in
running back or going down under
punts. Tackling was not required,
a touch on the back being necessary
to down the ball carrier. Some of

these touches were rather hard
ever, very much resembling a
mid-season tackle.

Coach Vorres has been'very well
pleased with his Freshman wrestling
squad this year, and he has awarded
numerals to eleven members of the
first-year team.

Kreuger Captain

David Krueger, a few years ago
champion at Lindblom High School
in the 125 and 150 lbs. class, is the
best man of the 117 pounds. He has
had lots of experience and will be a
good man on next year’s varsity. Le-
vine is another man in the 117 lb.
class; rather light, but full of pep
and ambition. He is a hard worker
and with the addition of a few more
pounds weight will probably give
Kreuger a run for his money next
year. Kreuger has been elected cap-
tain of the Freshman squad.

C. Erickson and J. Watson are in
the 127 lb. class. Erickson is a strong
boy and the best man in his weight.

He will be

a valuable addition to

the varsity. Watson is somewhat of
an unknown quality. He did well
while in residence in the Fall quar-
ter, but outside work prevented him
from becoming very well known.
However, we will probably hear more
about him later. Berkenshaw at pres-
ent is in the 137 lb. class, but is rath-
er light for that weight and will
