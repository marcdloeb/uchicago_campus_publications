WHAT of IT?

WORgEMORgE^^

My column of yesterday has elic-
ited interest from one quarter at
least. I had hardly expected it to do
that: it had to do with the woes of
a column conductor, and so it was
more in the way of an unburdening
of my own misery than an effort to
send the rest of the collegians back
home happy to the frat house. Nat-
urally enough, these things being as
they were, I had hardly looked for
anyone to do much more than read
it as a passing duty. But one man,
as I say, did more than that; he felt
the justice of my remarks on the
subject of column writing—the col-
umn struck back home, so far as he
was concerned. But then, again, I
suppose, there was no particular rea-
son why it shouldn’t. For the one
man whom it touched was a column
writer himself, and had himself un-
dergone experiences similar to those
through which I had passed. The man
was my esteemed co-worker. Terrible
Turk, whose duty it is to grind out
the Whistle, Maroon comic column.

* * •

‘Anent your comment about egg-
ing on from the superiors of the pa-
per,” said Turk, when he came up to
whisper in my ear yesterday after-
noon, “I have this to say . . that my
experience along the same lines was
even more gruesome than yours.
For,” continued Turk, "at the meet-
ing of The Maroon staff last Friday,
one of the guiding minds of the pa-
per got up and said, referring to my
column, that word had come out of
the office of the President of the
University that it was the dirtiest
thing those therein had had oppor-
tunity to read in many a long day.
Now,” said Turk, ‘‘were I at any
other college than this, I should have
considered that I had been paid the
highest of compliments. Indeed, I
should have felt that I had reached
the ultimate point of attainment in
comic writing, and that life had noth-
ing more to offer. But, unfortunate-
ly, I was not at any other college.”
And he looked ineffably sad.

• * •

“Now,” went on Terrible Turk
(or, as he is known in the flesh, Mr.
Leo Stone), “there was obviously
something to be done about the ac-
cusation made by ‘the president’s of-
fice’. There was no doubt that
‘the president’s office’ did not
look favorably upon my
progress towards what, in any
other place, would be considered the
acme of college comic attainment.
It is my desire,” said Mr. Stone,
“that my true position be made clear
to my admirers. I should like the
readers of The Maroon to understand
that I must do two things at once,
where only one ought to be done. I
must, first, include in my strip only
such stuff as will meet the approval
of the chaste taste of those who com-
pose our faculty; again, I must also
have enough stuff in it of that pecu-
liar nature which years of experience
has demonstrated best satisfies the
appetite of the collegian. So,” he
summed up, “life on the Whistle is
one eternal swing of the pendulum
from Whizz-Bang on one side
to Y. M. C A. bulletin on the other.”

* * *

I sympathize with Mr. Stone. His
difficulties appall me. In some as-
pects, they are even wore than those
which confront me. For Mr. Stone
cannot, like I can in my column, be
himself; he must be somebody, or
anybody, else—an indefinite organ
that must strike the no'te that the
crowd wants, although that note may
be more remote from his real nature
or inclinations than the South Pole, a
note which often enough he picks up
from somewhere else, and relays on.
Yessir, it’s a tough life, this being a
columnist. If, as Mr. Stone and I
agree, a few of the boys who smile
at our occasional miscarriages would
ley writing a column just once, in-
stead of smiling at our slips, they’d
find out for themselves.

Fight, Not Victory—Battle-cry of Students

PEP SESSION FOR
WISCONSION GO
FRIDAY NIGHT

‘Babe’ Meigs,. Jimmy Cusack,
and Jimmy Twohig Ex-

hort' Team to do Best

All the pep that a Mandel hall full
of men, women, and faith can mus-
ter will show the Old Man and his
Maroons that fight, not victory, is
what Chicago wants, when the last
pep session of the year, set for 7:15
tomorrow evening, calls two thousand
students to send their crippled heroes
into battle.

Four men whose characters have
built Maroon teams of every kind
will address the gathering. Jimmy
Twohig, keeper of Stagg field, who
has seen his “byes” win and lose for
thirty-five years will carry the spirit
of the “old school” to the team.
Babe Meigs, Maroon star of 1906 and
now publisher of the Herald-Exam-
iner is due to tell how football and
spirit .worked together twenty years
ago. Fritz Crisler, all-American end
and assistant coach, has a short mes-
sage for the team, as has Jim Cusack,
form captain of the track squad.

Stagg Carrie* Message

Amos Alonzo Stagg, with five con-
sective defeats to mar his record as
a coach, has the task of telling his

Talks to Class

In Newswriting

Mr. Frank K. Reilly, friend of
many Chicago writers from the days
of Eugene Field and George Ade,
has been invited to speak to mem-
bers of Mr. Frank H. O’Hara’s News-
writing class tomorrow at 11 in
Cobb 109.

Mr. Reilly is the president of the
Reilly and Lee Publishing company
of Chicago and president of the
White Paper club. Each quarter a
prominent speaker is asked to ad-
dress the class.

REQUEST CLUBS TO
ENUMERATE ITEMS
FOR Y. W. BAZAAR

Club donations for the Y. W.
Christmas Bazaar must be enumer-
ated to Rebeccah Green, chairman of
the committee, before Monday. The
clubs should state whether or not,
they wish any changes made in their
assignment of articles.

Miss Green has requested that one
representative from each club meet
with her this afternoon at 3 in the
Y. W. office of Ida Noyes hall. Club
donations for the bazaar include
handkerchiefs, shoe trees, gayters,
kitchen aprons, towels, bridge sets,
place cards, tally cards, candy and
cakes.

Ken Blake Plays

For Badger Mixer

Ken Blake will furnish the music
for the mixer at the Reynolds Club
after the Wisconsin game. There will
be dancing in both lounges and the
music will broadcasted into the south
lounge.

The members of the Deltho Club
will have charge of the refreshments.

Bugs? Telephone
Information Office
Clerk May Know

Frantic ringing of the telephone,
with a busy clerk rushing to answer
the summons. A sweet feminine voice
over the ’phone “Would you please
tell me what kind of bugs are crawl-
ing around in the coal pile in back
of the power house?” A moment of
distraction, and the Information Of-
fice transfers the call to the Biol-
ogy department.

Such intelligent questions are a
part of the requirements to be met
by the nimble brained clerks of the
office. Fast thinking is required to
tell at a moment’s notice the birth-
place of Vernon McPeanut Brittle/ or
the last name and telephone number
of a man named Charlie who lives on
Fifty-Seventh Street.

“No rest,” says the head clerk,
“for the wicket.”

ing in Cobb 206, Friday at twelve.

Frosh Board Decides

Class Dinner To Be

Held in Near Future

For the purpose of further ac-
quainting the Freshman with each
other, the Freshman Board of Man-
agement which held its first meeting
Tuesday night, has decided to hold a
class dinner or mixer in the near fu-
ture. The opinion of the class as to
which it desires most will be invited
at Chapel next Monday.

The advisability of Freshman week
was also discussed and, by arousing
class expression on it, the Board
hopes to determine just what its ad-
vantages and disadvantages were.

False Alarm! Bell
Awakens Greenwood

Alarm clocks created a stir at
Greenwood hall yesterday morn-
ing.	r

As a practical joke, members
of the hall set alarms which were
to ring at different intervals dur-
ing the night in the room of one
of the stqdents. When the first
alarm rang it was taken for the
fire bell, and everyone rushed
downstairs for fire drill.

Assured that it was a false call,
the women returned to bed, only
to be re-aWakened in a short time.
At 6:50 a bell summoned them
again from their sleep. It was
a real fire drill.

PRESS EXPERTS
DESIGN PROGRAM
FOR GREEK BALL

Complete Plans For Annual
Formal at Shoreland

Wednesday

Novel programs have been added
to the innovations to be introduced
at the Interfraternity ball on Novem-
ber 23. The University Press design-
ed a new program which will make
its debut at the affair at the Shore-
land when Greek meets Greek.

Credit for this novelty is divided
between Mr. Bauman and R. C.
Franz. The program will be printed
on a Japanese paper in three tones
and will contain the names of the
leaders and members of the Inter-
fraternity council who have planned
the ball.

Decorate With Shields

Decorations for this year’s ball
will center around the shields of the
campus fraternities which will be
hung around the walls of the ball-
room.

Refreshments consisting of punch
and cakes will be served during the
evening and at the conclusion of
the dancing, the revelers will go to
the Louis XVI room for an early
breakfast while Walter Ford’s synco-
pators play taps to the evening’s
merry-making.

Parisian Actress

Speaks On French

Cinema and Stars

Madame Adrienne Ambricourt, a
member of the cast of Mrs. Samuel
Insull’s Repertoire company now
playing “The Runaway Road,” will
talk at a meeting of Le Cercle Fran-
cais today at 4:30 in the Maison
Francais, 5810 Woodlawn Avenue.
The subject of her lecture will be
“Le Cinema en France,” in which
she will tell about moving pictures
and movie stars in France.

Besides taking part in “The Run-
away Road,” Madame Ambricourt
played with Sarah Bernhardt in New
York.

DEADLINE ON PHOTOS
FOR ANNUAL PASSES,

WARNING TO SENIORS

The deadline for Cap and Gown
pictures is passed and as usual there
are plenty of seniors, club women and
fraternity men who have not yet been
shot by the camera.

The editor forcibly states that there
will be no second deadline but the
procrastinating few may still see the
photographer if they do so immedi-
ately.

Proofs have already commenced to
pour in and it is generally conceded
that Morrison is no mean photog-
rapher.

Publications Board
Meets Today at 3:30

Members of the Board of Student
Publications will hold a meeting to-
day at 3:30 o’clock in the offices of
Frank H. O’Hara in Cobb hall.

It is imperative that all the mem-
bers be present according to Walter
Williamson, chairman, as important
matters will be discussed.

British Diplomat
To Hear Sydney
Men Debate Here

The debate to be held between
the University of Sydney, Australia,
and the University of Chicago will
have added interest in the presence
of the British Vice-Consul Lennox
and his wife at the banquet to pre-
cede the debate. Delta Sigma Rho
debating society in cooperation with
the English-Speaking Union, is giv-
ing the banquet, which will be held
in Hutchinson Refectory.

During the debate, the Women’s
Speaking club will act as ushers and
the Men’s Speaking club will have
charge of counting the ballots. Tic-
kets are on sale at the University
Book Store and at Woodworth’s.

PAY CLASS DUES
IN SENIOR CHAPEL
Carry Canes for Second

Time Today

Following an address by President
Max Mason in senior chapel today,
class dues will be collected. All mem-
bers of the senior class are requested
to have the exact change, twenty-five
cents, ready so that there will be no
confusion.

Senior canes make their second
appearance on campus today. The
University bookstore has been doing
a rushing business in these articles,
but there are still a number of se-
niors who have not heeded the warn-
ing of their president and do not pos-
sess swagger-sticks.

Groups have been organized by the
loyal senior men and they are deter-
mined to subdue the insurgents even
if drastic measures are found to be
necessary.

Men Uphold Doris

Blake’s Advice In

Problems Of Love

With the men upholding Doris
Blake, and the women firmly arguing
that her column should be abolished,
members of the Women Speakers’
club and the Men Speakers’ club will
stage a debate tonight at 7 in Ida
Noyes hall.

Formally stated, the question for
debate is “Resolved: That the Doris
Blake column should be abolished
from the Chicago Daily Tribune.”
The affirmative side will be upheld by
Ida Rubenstein, Margaret Knox, and
Evelyn Starling, V. Frank Coe, Hal
Arden, and Leonard W. Stearns are
members of the negative team.

Maroon Balloons
Rise at Kick-Off

Seven hundred maroon balloons
will darken the skies at the open-
ing kick-off of the final game of
the season with Wisconsin Satur-
day.

This plan was announced by Bill
Weddell, head cheer leader, after
a consideration of the success of
past “balloon cheers.” Forty wom-
en will sell seven hundred maroon,
and three hundred red balloons.
Proceeds will go to the University
Settlement fund.

All saleswomen have been re-
quested to meet Saturday, at 12, in
the Reynolds club, with boxes for
money and $1.50 in change.

EXAM, ATTITUDE
AND ACTIVITIES
BASES OF CHOICE

Attendance Likewise Earns
Membership For
Yearlings

Sixty-eight Freshmen were elected
to membership in the Green Cap club
yesterday.

Membership was awarded on four
qualifications: the mark given on the
examination, the amount of extra
curricular activities which candidates
assumed in addition to the Green Cap
club, the general attitude of the can-
didates, and the regularity of attend-
ance, according to John Howe, chair-
man of the Board of Directors.

Limit Extended

“The original plan was to limit the
membership in the organization to
forty men sc that the group might
not be so unwieldly as to prevent its
functioning after the upper-class-
men step out. The sixty-eight men
however, were so regular in attend-
ance, and so admirable in attitude
that we could not rightfully keep
them out,” Howe stated.

Successful Candidates

Arthur Abbott, Clifford Alger,
Herbert Beardsley, William Belt,
Herbert Beech', Joseph Bonnem, Dun-
ning Brown, Joseph Brady.

William F. Calohan, Louis Engel,

WOMEN INTRIGUED

BY SWEDISH WORK;

NOW TAKE LESSONS

Bright colored mittens, whose pat-
terns represent the different sections
of Sweden, have invaded the campus.

Women have asked Mrs. Anna Pe-
terson Berg, the Swedish instructor
who brought the mittens to Ida
Noyes hall with her exhibition of
Swedish needlework, to teach them
her novel stitches. Accordingly Mrs.
Berg has arranged to extend her visit
so that beginning next week she will
give lessons in Swedish handicraft
from 9 to 12 in the Sewing room on
the third floor of Ida Noyes hall.

Set Last Date for

Mirror Manuscripts

Final deadline for Mirror manu-
scripts has been set for Tuesday at
12. They may be submitted to Bet-
ty Graham, president of Mirror at
5831 Kenwood Avenue.

Women selected at the recent try-
outs should meet with Mr. Frank
Parker tomorrow at 3:30. Further
ballet try-outs will be held at 4:30.

was bitter cold as we buttoned our great coats and edged into
the blizzard just outside the east campus entrance of Harper at

9:50 the
hurled us
the snow
Hennery,

other evening. Verily, the driving snow and chill sleet
on into the thick of the storm. And then the wind died,
floated eerily, the sleet pattered down, and Joe, Oscar,
and we took stock of the whereabouts.

campus was a glistening symphony of purest white. In

back of us the Gothic of Harper silhouetted itself bulkily against
the blackness. Leering over us like the teeth of the Pebeco lady
were the halls—Foster, and the others. And law, a blind, hoary
giant. And there were the quadrangles, dream-castles of diamonds,
breathing the very essence of beauty, holiness, paradise. And over
all, freezing all, hung the cold, piercing, relentless.

“Holy cockeye!” in a tremulous voice from the depths of Hen-
nery’s red and blue muffler, "it’s cold.”

And it was. To us it was colder than it was beautiful. To us
the coldness was the most imminent thing in all the world. To us
a cup of coffee would mean more than everything life had to offer.

“Let’s shivered Oscar in a numb voice, "let’s get a cup of
coffee at - -at - - the coffee shop!”

Surely the powers that be had read that sweeping plaint of The
Daily Maroon and had decided to keep the coffee shop open until
10 P. M. Surely they had done that.

But the coffee shop was closed. Our blue fingers and ice-
encrusted boots pounded in vain. Joe dropped dead on the Seal,
Hennery froze stiff crossing the street a moment later, Oscar moved
an eyelid after three hours of boiling, and we - - - we wondered if
the coffee shop people actually missed that editorial.

THE COUP D’ETAT OF BRAWN

S the debate regaining consciousness?

For more than a decade now this iron-souled old institution
has been slowly falling into lethargy. It has not only been treated
lightly but it has been almost completely ignored. Athletics have
swept over the realm of collegiate interest like an Ohio river at flood-
time. They are responsible in a large part for the swamping of the
only existing fom of mental competition between institutions of
learning.

This belated position of the debate is a distinct Americanism.
In pre-football, times—as in England now—intercollegiate struggles
were won or lost from the rostrum. Victory came to a silver-tongued
oator and to the man with the nimble wit. It was brains versus
brains. But that was before the coup d’etat of brawn.

The University of Sydney-Maroon debate approaches. Last
week the Australians out-witted and out-argued the University of
Kansas by forty points.

Over in Harper library a record-breaking number of aspiants
to the trio tried out this year. They showed renewed interest. Re-
port has it that they are a leaher-lunged lot, that they have been well
trained and are well prepared. Is this rejuvenated interest in debat-
ing a result of an unsuccessful football team? Does mental competi-
tion revive when the battle of brawn declines? We wonder.

TO GOPHER CAMP

FOR TITLE MEH

Burke, Williams, Hegovic,
Jackson, Berndtson, and

Hitz Make Trip

After an absence of two years,
Chicago will again enter a cross-
country team to compete for the Big
Ten Championship in this annual
event. This year’s meet will be held
next Saturday at Minneapolis where
each school in the conference will be
represented by a teahi of not more
than ten men.

Difficult Course

The following runners, Burke, Wil-
liams, Hegovic, Hitz, Jackson and
Berndtson will leave next Friday
night. The Maroon entries will be
seriously handicapped by the nature
of the five mile course. This course
adjoins the banks of the Mississippi
river, has two hills, over a hundred
feet high, which are the obstacle to
the Chicago team, since they have
been unable to train on anything but
a level track.

Wisconsin Favored

The favorites to cop the top
places are, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Ohio
state. Last year’s victor, Chapman,
of Wisconsin, will receive some stiff
competition from Hunn, who placed
second last year and Capt. Spears, of
Iowa. Chicago’s best bet is Wake-

WOMEN BOWL NOW;

GOLF SEASON OVER

Bowling is now the fad in women’s
sports. Since the cold weather has
driven away the golfers every day
from 2:30 to 3:30 women enthusiasts
bowl in the lower gym of Ida Noyes
hall.

Women find the game complicated
as well as fascinating. The difficult
rules are hard to learn, and the six-
teen pound balls are causes of com-
plaint. All muscles are exercised,
but it is enjoyable sport, and there is
promise of many husky players be-
fore the season is over.

WIN TOUCHBALL TITLE

RAIN PUB RISK IN SCRIMMAGE SO

First Cage Injury

Lalon Farwell, guard on the
basketball squad, earned the dis-
tinction of having suffered the
first injury of the cage season,
when, during last night’s scrim-
mage his upper lip was badly torn.
Two stitches had to be taken to
close the wound and Farwell will
be out of practice for about a
week. Curiously, his lip was torn
in almost the same place during
the 1925 season.

INDOOR TRACK WILL
START NEXT WEEK;

MATERIAL IS GOOD

The Indoor Track season will of-
ficially open next week, following the

cross country meet,

Conference

which is to be held Saturday over
Minnesota’s course.

According to the coaches’ opinion
the season’s outlook for the Maroon
squad is exceedingly bright. Coach
Stagg is concentrating on building
up a two mile relay team. It will be
headed by Ex. Capt. Cusack and will
be filled out by three phenomenal
freshman from last season, namely:
Burke, Williams, and Gist. Each one
of these men is able to trot the one-
half distance in under two minutes.

Many of the football men are ex-
pected to change their moleskins for
track togs and help bolster the squad
especially in the field and weight
events. Capt. Bert McKinney is the
most valuable of these men.

MACS, BURTONS

ARE RUNNERS - UP

Deke, Psi U, Alpha Delt,
Phi Gam, Sig Nu, D. U.,
Phi Sig Lead Greeks

The club touchball championship
struggle came to an end last night
with the announcement of the Car-
dinal outfit as league winners by the
Intramural office. The Cardinals
swept through the season a bit ahead
of the Macs and Burtons in the per-
centage column and the final tally
gives them the winners cup with the
latter clubs taking second and third
respectively.

The results in the fraternity
leagues are still enshrouded in mys-
terious figures but in each league sev-
eral teams are far in the lead. Sigma
Nu with four wins and one tie leads
the Gamma section. Chi Psi having
won three and lost two is second.
Kappa Nu is third with one win, one
tie, one defeat and two to play.

Phi Gams Ahead

In Alpha league Phi Gamma Delta
with four wins and one tie are
ahead while Kappa Sig, with two
wins and two losses trail. Delta Up-
silon and Phi Sigma Delta of Epsilon
division are running a neck and neck
race, both having a record of three
wins and one tie apiece.

ROUSE BADGER PEP
IN ANNUAL BANQUET

Simmering Wisconsin spirit in
Chicago will be heated to the boiling
pot Friday evening at the Annual
Football Dinner of the University of
Wisconsin Club of Chicago, which is
to be given this year in the Hotel
LaSalle. All Wisconsin alumni and
their guests have been notified and
the re-union will be one of the best
ever staged by the Badgers. The Car-
dinal Band and a squad of cheerlead-
ers will be on hand to work up the
pep. Coach George Little and Presi-
dent Glen Frank will speak to the
team and the guests.

The Cardinal mentors are
toes this week, smoothing

1926.—
on their
out the

rough spots in the new Wisconsin
offensive combination. Little realizes
that the Maroons are always difficult
to dispose of in the closing game at
Stagg Field and will not permit his
boys to ease up at all after the Iowa

victory.

None

injured

of the outstanding players
Badger roster were seriously
in last Saturday’s affair.

Jeff Burrus, who was held on the
bench due to an injury, will surely
be a starter at the Midway, his last
game for the Cardinal. Leitl, veteran

“Let it rain, let it pour.” So voiced
the Old Man last evening as he took
his gridders under the shelter of the
new North Stand and again put them
through signal drill.

Although the first hard session of
the week was expected for last night,
it turned out to be another light
work-out. If it hadn’t been for the
steady downpour which lead up to
and continued through practice
hours there would have been scrim-
mage, no doubt, and plenty of it.

Save Team

With the slippery playing condi-
tions it was too dangerous a task to
risk the team in injuries. With all
the players in good shape for the
first time this year Coach Stagg
wants to keep them that way for
the Badger fray.

If any light was cast on the com-
ing game by the easy drill last eve-
ning it surely was that the Maroons
are to take the field ready to open
up with forward passes, trick plays.

PRINCE ALBERT stepped out into the world
nearly twenty years ago. Success was immediate
. . . and outstanding. Because P. A. measures
up to the first and greatest rule for success: It has
the goods! The school of experience has pro-
duced no finer tobacco than this.

Just buy yourself a tidy red tin of P. A. and
tamp a load flush with the muzzle of your old
jimmy-pipe. Connect with a match, and let
that first wonderful drag tell you that no other
tobacco can come within a mile of this for sheer
pipe-quality.

Cool as a dormitory radiator. Sweet as an
extra cut. Fragrant as a peach-orchard. P. A.
can’t bite your tongue or parch your throat
—another important detail. Get yourself some
Prince Albert today. No other tobacco can
bring you so much downright smoke-pleasure.

THE DAILY MAROON, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1926

FIRST SNOW FLAKES

First flakes of snow slip stealthily
down

Through an unknown realm of air—

Frightened to yield to the unclean
town

Their virgin bodies bare.

Slipping, rising, a sudden plunge,

Then smirched on the eager mud

They give themselves with a quick-
ened lunge—

Scare feel the leathery thud.

Faster and eagerly fall new flakes

In a passion gripped, reckless throng

Leaving their souls in their vanished
wakes,

Singing a soundless song.

OH SHADES OF DEPARTED
WHISTLE EDITORS, Hearken!
With a tear smiling from each of
our deep violet eyes, we tremblingly
inscribe for the fi rst time in Whistle
history— A Contributod’s Day! !

At the Windermere Gone West

Dear Whistle:

The Anatomy bulletin board over
at the Medical school announces that
“The Bone room will be open every
Thursday from five to six.” We wish
you would find ^out the cover charge
and whose orchestra is playing.

—Nelson’s Nephew

YOU SEE?

I think perhaps you wondered why
As we stood idly laughing there,
I said so suddenly, “Kiss me good-
bye.”

You see it was a little prayer

That kiss.... to guard me well

When I went out with him. I could
not tell

How I might feel, but dear, I knew
The little kiss would see me through
For I could never. . . . never care
For him. . . .remembering you.

—Peter Pan

Only Over Atlas’s Dead Body

Turk:

You are very fortunate in having
a contributor like Peter Pan. Her
varying moods intrigue me. The gay
nonchalance of that risidculous end-
ing in “Real Life Pictures”—the
wistfulness of “There are a Thou-
sand Little Strings”—the delightful
fantasy of “Mood”—the bitterness
of “Remembrance” and oh, a thou-
sand other things I haven’t time to
mention. I should like to meet her.

AW!

Feller that’s alius yellin’ advice
about not cryin’ over spilt milk most
generally hain’t spilt none himself.

A man would rather pick up a lem-
on than have a peach thrown at
him.

No matter how free he is with his
moQey, a man can’t drop a nickel
without slapping his foot on it.

—Sis

ECSTASY

Great God, who ruleth the heavens
above,

Why hast thou sent me this curse
called love?

I had but meant to ply my books,
And ne’er to respond to amorous
looks,

Or rest my head on someone’s breast
Wtih face upturned in unholy quest
Of kisses warmed, by passion’s fire.
But now my heart burns with desire,
And my eyes gleam with an emotion
Inspired, thou knowest, against my
volition.

My lips are parted, and fast my
breath,

God grant I expire in this little
death!

THOUSAND ARE
AUTO VICTIMS

Committee Predicts 520,000
Fatalities In Next
Two Decades

Approximately 165,000 persons
lost their lives during the past
twenty years as a result of automo-
bile accidents, according to a state-
ment issued by the Committee on
Traffic Accident Statistics of the Na-
tional Conference on Street and
Highway Safety. This number is
equivalent to the total population in
such towns as Ft. Worth, Tex., Grand
Rapids, Mich., or Youngstown, O.

The Committee estimates that if
the death rate f rom automobile ac-
cidents in 1925 should continue un-
changed for the next twenty years,
and if the population of the United
States at the same time should re-
main stationary, the total number of
fatilities due to automobile accidents
in that period will be approximately
440,000 persons.

If adequate steps are not taken to
curb the growing menance of auto-
mobile accidents, the results will be
an increasing number of deaths from
this cause year after year.

Should the population of the Unit-
ed States increase during the next
twenty years at the same rate that it
has increased annually since 1920,
and if the automobile death rate
should remain the same as in 1925,
the total number of deaths during the
next two decades would be about
520,000 persons, or a number equiv-
alent to the total population of cities
like Milwaukee, Wis., or Washing-
ton, D. C.

The number of deaths from auto-
mobile accidents has increased year
by year from a total of 412 in 1906
to a total of 21,627 in 1925.

grads, who, stuck with their team
through the two recent reverses. Lit-
tle, and his staff, deserve unlimited
credit for revamping their attack in
five days after the Michigan encoun-
ter. It was a perfectly functioning
overhead attack, a series of smashing
line plays and some clever cut backs
that resulted in the three touchdowns
that sent the Hawkeyes back to Iowa
City the losers.

Gene Rose and Joe Kresky, sopho-
more backs, playing their first full
games for Coach Little, covered
themselves with glory. The first men-
tioned turned in as fine an exhibition
of forward passing seen on Randall
field for years, and in addition was a
power on the defense and a threat
when toting the ball off the tackles.
Kresky was making more than his
share of tackles in the secondary
defense, and gained regularly when
called upin to hit the Hawk’s line.

Crofoot was a splendid field gen-
eral, mixing them up with
such deception that the opposi-
tion were taken off their guards on
numerous occasions. Capt. Harmon
played his best game of the year at
halfback, going into the fray shirtly
after the starting whistle. Welch
and Cameron were great at the ends,
especially in the art of pass receiv-
ing.

The game was unusual in that
there was very little punting all after-
noon. Both elevens displayed strong
offensive power, and slightly weaker
defensive strength. Schuette and
Straubel were the shining lights in
the Cardinal forward wall.

There will be but one strenuous
scrimmage for the regulars this week
which will be held Wednesday. The
squad will journey to Chicago Friday
morning.
