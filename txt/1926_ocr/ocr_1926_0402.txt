Here it is, tourney fans,—the
first all-star team of this year’s
Interscholastic. It is offered for
your approval at this particular
time because today is Friday and
it is somewhat of a fish yarn;
otherwise it would have been an-
nounced yesterday in observance
of April Fool’s Day. Here it is:
Left Forward, Bass of Bracken-
bridge High, San Antonio; Right
Forward, Trout of Newton, Kan-
sas; Center, Cook of Technical
High, Atlanta, Georgia; Right
Guard, Bean of Newton, Iowa;
and Left Guard, Corn of Roswell,
New Mexico.

This all-star aggregation is to
be called the All-Mealtime Team.
What better combination could
one select for Friday? It is the
team of the day. Cook is made
captain of this well balanced
quintet.

Eight teams, losers of the first
round of major tournament, will
meet today to battle for places in
the semi-finals of the consolation
tournament. At 10 Canton, III., will
meet the Point Pleasant, W. Va.,
foam. Thia should be a close game
as the teams are fairly evently
matched. Following this fray, the
Billings, Mont., quintet will fight it
out with L. D. S. High of Salt Lake
City, Utah. The latter is the favor-
ite in this meet. In the afternoon
Omaha, Neb., meets Oak Ridge and
Zanesville battles Cedar Rapids.

SPRING INTRAMURAL
WILL START SOON

Spring Intramural activities, al-
though temporarily delayed by the
arctic complex of the weather, will
get underway as soon as the Inter-
scholastic has been completed. John
Howe, Spring sports manager, has
appointed lieutenants who will aid

him.

lows:
well;

Carl

Field

The appointments are as fol-
Playground ball, Lalon Far-
Golf, Robert Engberg; Tennis,
Erickson; Spring Track and
Carnival, William Weddell.

According to John Howe the tenta-
tive dates for the opening of each
separate sport season have been set
for early starts so that each sport
will have ample time to complete its
season before the annual grind for
the spring finals begins. Playground-
ball under Lalon Farwell will start on
April 18th, and Tennis will commence
the following week under Carl Erick-
son. To assure good playing condi-
tions for Golf date will be held up
until the first part of May. The date
for the annual spring track meet has
not been set yet but it undoubtedly
will occur during the first week of
June.

Immediately after the close of the
Basketball Interscholastic the Intra-
mural office will be opened in Bart-
lett gym where information and en-
try blanks can be obtained.

Running guard, Marshall, a team-
mate of Gist’s was a very good man
and is likely to appear in the varsity
line-up next season.

The regular yearling forwards
were Bob Kaplan, of Englewood, and
Cooper, former Lindblom star. Kap-
lan is a very fast man and has a good
eye for the basket, and together
with Cooper, a very good short range
shot, make an expert scoring combi-
nation.

John McEwan, a big 185 pound
standing guard, has a specialty of
preventing follow-up shots by per-
sistently retrieving the ball from the
back-board. Frosh football center
Williams, was another fine defensive
player, while Jim Black, formerly at
Illinois, also won his numerals as a
standing guard.

Floor guard Coulter, of Frankfort,
Ind., was awarded reserve numerals,
while Porkel, of Oak Park, forward,
and McGregor, of Yankton, S. D.,
former team-mate of • John Mc-
Donough, varsity guard this last
winter, were also given the “1929”
sweaters.

CLASSES DISMISSED
FOR NOON SERVICE

Upon direction of President Max
Mason, all 12:30 classes will be dis-
missed today. An all-university serv-
ice (voluntary) will be held in Leon
Mandel assembly hall at the regular
chapel hour, 12 o’clock.

Recorder and Examiner.

Maroon week, the most comprehen-
sive all-campus event of the quarter,
will begin with a bang at eight Mon-
day morning with a special Monday
issue of the Maroon, which will be
distributed gratis to subscribers. And
campus women, thirty-five strong,
will be on hand to start the festiv-
ities and start them right.

Saleswomen, under the general
chairmanship of Ruth Burtis will be-
gin work at once with the undisguised
intention of selling more subscriptions
for the Spring quarter than have ever
before been sold in one week.

Nor will their first day’s work go
unrewarded. An elaborate banquet,
at which Frank H. O’Hara and
Thomas R. Mulroy will be the speak-
ers has been planned to take place
at 6:30 in Ida Noyes cafe. All of

Three Maroon water polo play-
ers have been placed on the All-
Conference Big Ten Weekly
mythical lineup. P. Petrolowitz
w’ho has backed the water artists
for several seasons and who led
this winter’s squad to a success-
ful finish is the only Maroon who
has been named as first team man.

John Howe and R. K. Kilchrist,
also experts wet-ball handlers,
have been considered of high cali-
ber and are to grace the secnnd
string lineup. Both Howe and
Gilchrist have earned their letters
in the former splashing game,
water basketball and have added
many counters to MacGillivray’s
squads.

Parker Hall, one of the most
apt goal defenders in the Confer-
ence has one more year in which
to exhibit his prowess.

form of a 28-26 defeat, and
Newton, Kansas, crashed

Westport of Kansas City still has
both high point men of the tourney.
Welsh, stellar forward and captain
added three field goals and two foul
tosses to his total. His team-mate
Holbert tossed in four from the field
and brought his total up to 44 also.

Forney, gigantic red head from
Newton, is in third place because of
the six buckets he tossed in and
brought his total up to thirty.

Because of the elimination of the
Westport outfit, it is hardly probable
that Welsh or Holbert will finally
come out with the honors. Forney
is expected to come through espe-
cially as he is on a team that is con-
ceded the best chance to win the
tourney.

Elkins, of San Antonio has kicked
in twelve field goals in two games
and is in fourth place.

j clashes with Point Pleasant of West
j Virginia. Canton put up a stiff fight
against Scott County of Mississippi
before they were eliminated and the
Point Pleasant outfit took defeat
only at the hands of the powerful
Westport, Kansas team, so that this
first game should also prove to be
one of the best. At 11 the Billings,
Montana rangers will try to rope in
the cowboys from Salt Lake City,
but the Mormon team is liable to
break out with a surprise and upset
the dope.

A feature tilt is scheduled for two
o’clock, Memphis, Tennessee, taking
on Oak Ridge High of Louisiana.
Memphis is the team that forced
Gaylord to go into an overtime peri-
od to get a 25 to 24 victory. At
3 o’clock Zanesville and Cedar
Rapids come together in the final
consolation game of the day.

THEY PULLED A YANKTON

Salem, N. D., pulled an April Fool
stunt on the highly-regarded West-
port five, which was doped to come
through to the finals, in a classic
game when Salem won 28-26. The
Salem team featuring light, capable
men managed to pull the biggest up-
set of the tournament through their
uncanny shooting ability, making a
surprising number of their chances
good. Westport under-rated their
opponents’ ability to shoot from dis-
tances well out on the floor, refusing
to hurry the Salem men’s throws at
the basnet, and this resulted directly
in their defeat. The score at the
end of the first half was 15 to 13
in favor of South Dakota. They

Nanticoke Prays to Victory

Nanticokes’ trust in God that they
showed in the prayer they all joined
in before the Wheeler game was
enough to put the southern team out
of the tourney. The Wheeler team
put up a good battle and led at half
time 11-8. However, the Nanticoke

boys held another revival meeting
during the intermission and finished
strong for a 17-14 win.

Gaylor, the midget five from a tiny
school of twenty-seven boys, came
through with one of the biggest up-
sets of the tourney when they de-
feated Atlanta, Georgia, by a score
of 23 to 7. The winners presented an
air tight defense that was never
pierced and they held the heavier
southern team to a lone field goal.
Corcoran played a wonderful game
for Gaylor. He was all over the
floor on defense and in addition scored
six baskets. The Minnesota guards,

Fargo, North Dakota, was forced
to go five minutes overtime to defeat
Elkins, West Virginia, 25-20, in the
third round of the torney. The game
was even all the way and Elkins led
5 to 4 at the half. Glenn the little
West Virginia forward was the high
point man of the game with six bas-
kets which kept his team in the run-
ning. Bristol and O’Connor were
the big scoring men for the Dakota
five. The work of the guards on
both teams was outstanding.

You have probably noticed that ev-
ery game of the Interscholastic is
played with a brand new basketball.
One good reason for this is the fact
that these basketballs are presented
after each game to the victorious
team, to be kept by that team as a
trophy.

Before it is turned over to the win-
ners, however, an inscription is put
on the cover telling of the teams,
their scores, the time and the place
of the game. The lettering is in black,
outlined in white, and makes a very
presentable token for exhibition pur-
purposes. For trophy rooms, such a
keepsake makes a more effective
show-piece than the beautiful gold
and silver loving cups which usually
adorn the shelves, because of the act-
ual connection that the basketball has
with the playing of the game and the
significance attached to it in bringing
forth that all-important victory which
the team played so hard to win.

Many of the teams which have
won games have no trophy rooms in
which to exhibit the coveted basket-
balls to the fellow towns people, but
in such cases there are always plenty
of local merchants who will proudly
donate their choice show case room
for the occasion.

Members of the first cabinet have
announced that the second cabinet list
is not completed as several vacancies

University physiologists are not
particularly impressed by the recent
fasting feat of Siegried Herze who
claims to have bested the world’s
hunger record by fasting forty-four
days in a public exhibition in Berlin.

According to Dr. Nathaniel Klcit-
man, in the physiology department
of the University, Herze could have
gone about sixteen days more and
still have survived. He lost only
twenty percent of his weight, Dr.
Kleitman points out, and it is possible
for human beings and animals to lose
about 'forUy percent before dying
of hunger.

Furthermore he indicated that
Frederick Hoelzel, lay scientists
working for the University physiology
laboratory voluntarily experienced
two long fasts: one of thirty-three
days and the other of forty-one with-
out feeling an ill effect. Hoelzel was
a perfectly normal thin person when
he concluded his longer fast, Dr.

normal cerebral activity, as is shown
by the feeling of exaltation, visual
and auditory hallucinations, etc.
These phenomena are probably deter-
mined quite as much by the type of
emotional processes of the individual
as the effects of starvation, since
they are reported more frequently
by religious ascetics, than by worldly-
minded men starving for the purpose
of science or health.”

After a five day fast Prof. Carl-
son says it took him two or three

days to recover from a feeling of
bodily weakness. He continues, “The
writer felt as if he had a month’s va-
cation in the mountains. The mind
was unusually clear and a larger
amount of physical and mental work
was accomplished without fatigue. In
the writers own case, the five days’
starvation period increased the vigor
of the gastric hunger contractions to
that of a young man of twenty or
twenty-five, and the empty stomach
retained this increased vigor for at
least three weeks after the hunger
period, when observations were dis-
continued owing to absence from the
University.”

COLLEGE must not merely serve its purpose; it must try always
to serve that purpose better. It must watch for waste that it
can eliminate, and better tactics that it can adopt. College must
never stand still.

To such a princilpe Mr. Ernest Hatch Wilkins has devoted, during
his two-and-a-half years as Dean of the Colleges, an energy and a
courage that few men devote to any cause. “Better Yet ’ has been
his slogan. He has been no pessimist; the Colleges, he believed, were
in general doing their work well. But they must do it better. He
has seen their weaknesses and faced them honestly. Five deans
were not enough for 2,500 students; they could have little more
than a superficial acquaintance with the needs of their proteges.
There was one fault. Another was the waste of instructors efforts
on third-rate students, while the more capable waited. Upon such
problems as these, Dean Wilkins began the attack.

Some of his achievements may be listed:

A staff of twice the former number of deans: Although the num-
ber is still too small, students receive far more personal attention in
planning their courses.

Special opportunities for studients of unusual ability: They may
register early, before deans are tired and courses full; and they are >
grouped, when possible, in special classes where students less apt will
not hinder their progress.

The Better Yet Campaign: Students and faculty, working to-
gether, attacked a score of college problems, and found, not only
that these problems can be attacked—but that students and faculty
can attack them together.

More useful activities: Publications, dramatics, and dozens of
open clubs have gained, through Mr. Wilkins' constant interest and
through his appointment of a Director of Activities, an intelligent
guidance that they long needed.

Mr. Wilkins has not attained these ends wholly: they demand
decades and millions. But he has begun the fight squarely; he has
taken bold strides. In spite of failing health, and the prospect of a
certain breakdown, he pursued his program with a rare vigor.

Because of his advances, the Colleges serve their purpose better.
Because of his honest courage, and vigor, and never-satisfied fire,
the Colleges will try to serve their purpose better still.

Run Special Matinees
On New Blocki Play

A New York theatrical custom
new to Chicago will be introduced
to this city shortly by a Chicagoan
when a new play is first given for a
series of special matinees at the
Studebaker theatre before a regular
run. The play is a new comedy-
drama entitled “Cap-Sized” written
and produced by Fritz Blocki. It is
at present scheduled for two per-
formances, on Monday and Thurs-

day afternoon, April 5 and 8.

The play will be presented
star cast including Patricia
Manners, Eric Kalkhurst, and

by a
Ann
Char-

ner Batson. Miss Manners will be
remembered particularly by students
of the University as having sung at
the last Washington Prom. She was
at that time playing “Gretchen” in
“The Student Prince” at the Great
Northern Theatre, where she played
for more than a year. She steps
from this popular operetta into the
leading part in Blocki’s “Cap-Sized.”

Urge All Eligible Men
Appear; Experience
Unnecessary

With the assurance of many good
parts in the coming production,
Blackfriars announce tryouts for
the parts in the cast for Tuesday at
7:30 in the theater of the Reynolds
club.

All undergraduate men who are
scholastically eligible for public ap-
pearance are urged to attend the
first tryouts. Experience in previ-
ous shows is not essential to obtain-
ing a part in the play as there is
talent on the campus which has not

Tuesday night, the majority of the
songs were chosen. Four important
lyrics remain for which the musical
competition is still open. These are:
the Opening Chorus; “We’re the
Campus Women”; “Please Louise,”
and “Tag Along With Me.”

Three new lyrics which have just
been written for the show are also
without musical scores. Copies of
all these lyrics may be obtained from
Cullom by any who wish to submit
for them.

April 12, the date of the close of
this competition for musical scores
will mark the first rehearsal of the
chorus for the production.

Chorus Tryouts Start Thursday

Tryouts for the chorus will be
held Thursday, April 8, afternoon at
3, in the Reynolds club theater. Men
who do not succeed in getting parts
in the cast will be asked to come
back aagin for tht chorus tryouts.
Mr. Hamilton Coleman, director of
Blackfriars shows, has asked that
every man who has a good voice try
out for the show as there are great
possibilities in this year’s production.

A reorganization of the staff is to
take place owing to the ineligibility
or absence of former members. At
a meeting of the hoard of superiors
yesterday, a new business manager
was selected to take the place of
George Wiemer. This successor as
well as the other changes made in
the staff will be announced next
week.

Hold Poster Contest

A poster contest for advertising
the Blackfriars show has been in-
stituted. Men wanting to compete
are requested to see Cullom who will
give them the information pertinent
♦o this work.

“With these activities,” said Cul-
lom, “the actual work on production
will get under way.

Vale to speak and are opening their
meeting to the students at large.

A social or fellowship hour will
preceed the address. At this time an
Hawaiian trio will play their native

music on Hawaiian instruments.

“Dr. Vale,” said Dr. T. M. Carlisle,
advisor to Presbyterian students, has
been in great demand to address uni-
versity students. He is a speaker of
power and should prove interesting
to the men and women of this cam-
pus.”

“The Nature of the World
and Man” To Be Work
of Specialists

By Milton S. Mayer

One hundred million years ago—or
perhaps before that—there swam in
'the sea, ran over the land, flew in the
air animals whose remains have in-
volved their descendants in specula-
tion and controversy without end . . .
Who are we? What is our world, and
our universe and our ancestry and
our heritage?

Sixteen eminent scientists, whose
lives have been spent in grasping for
the infinite have formed a unique
collaboration. Under the guidance
of Horatio Hackett Newman, chair-
men of the department of zoology,
these men have banded together to
write “The Nature of the World and
Man”—a volume of sixteen chapters,
each written by a recognized leader
in a particular field of science.

Savants Meet Weekly

Every Monday night since last No-
vember these men have met to mull
over each member’s contribution, to
mold it into the evolutionary trend

in May, and the world will receive
a mosaic record of its history.

The scientists contributing are F.
R. Moulton, Rollin Chamberlain, J.
Harlan Bretz, Harvey B. Lemon, Ju-
lius Stieglitz, Horatio H. Newman,
Edwin Oakes Jordan, H. C. Cowles,
Merle C. Coulter, W. C. Allee, Alfred

“We have attempted more than the
publication of a book,” explained Dr.
Newman; “we have tried to correlate
all the natural sciences. It has been
the aim of the men who have contri-

Do You Really
Think You Are
College? Naive!

There’s no college man like an In-
terscholasticist. Take a look, people,
take a look at some of the boys after
you’ve said “Hello, boys,” as T. R.
used to say. Look at those hot shirts,
those wow ties, those fireless cooker
hats—the college man isn’t in it.
Nor is he in such trow, such oh, oh,
double-oh big and wide Oxford (Ohio)
bags—

Collegiate, collegiate, yes, yes, we
are. We think we are. And now—
ain't you ashamed, when you see men
who are still in high school, some of
them as yet mere boys, all dressed
up fit to kill any affection, affinity,
or association any co-ed (that word
isn’t in the dictionary and no doubt
is a bit something or other) might
have, feel, or maintain toward any
of our undergraduate members, or, as
in some cases, graduates?

Stories have been going around
fraternity-houses for y’ars and y’ars,
about how, after the boys leave so
do your new dress ties. But now—
now every young Interscholastic is
making Joe College look like ten
cents worth of Wrigley’s Pepsin,
which is good gum if you like it. Joe

He’s out of things, sartorially,
a wet Oscar, a back number, a
ply-isn’t-in-it, compared with

boys from Kiwagasaga. There was a
time when they used Joe College for
a model—but Joe College is gone, his
place is no more—Those boys had
bettor look out, or their genial hosts
will send them home, victorious and
free—freed from dear possessions.
Some of them will even lose their
Southern drawls, so envious are the
boys at the .... house of them.

buted to focus the widely diversified
fields of science with a mutual point
of view. We hope that our humble
efforts have produced something
more than a textbook—something for
every human being who, like us, won-
ders HOW. and WHEN, and WHY.”

NEWSPAPER OFFERS
PRIZE TO STUDENTS

What are the principals of the
World Court? Whepe is the in-
compatibility between capital and
labor?

The New York Times wants to
give $200 to the University student
who can answer similar questions
best. In fact, this newspaper has
made this offer to thirteen colleges
throughout the country, including
Columbia, Harvard, Princeton,
Yale, Cornell, Pennsylvania, Min-
nesota, Virginia, Anapolis, West
Point, and Chicago. The under-
graduate in each of these institu-
tions who passes the highest exam-
ination in current events will re-

duct the University examination
on Saturday, March 1, at 1:00 p.
m. He requests that those in-
tending to compete send in their

ALLEN TELLS OF
EGYPTIAN DECUNE

Contrasts Pyramid Builders
With Present Day
Inhabitants

The Pharaohs of ancient Egypt
piled up two-ton blocks of stone to
build the great pyramids, oriented ex-
actly with the points of the compass,
but the modern inhabitants of the
Nile valley have not enough engin-
eering skill to construct drainage sys-
tems, asserted Prof. T. G. Allen in
a radio speech last night from the
University through The Daily News
station, WMAQ.

Developing the thesis that Egypt
is a land of striking contrasts, Prof.
Allen told how the ignorance and
poverty of the country’s present in-
habitants differs from the advanced
civilization of ancient times.

Have Poor Sanitation

Modern sanitation, for instance, is
practically unknown. A field house,
constructed at Luxor for investigators
from the University, had to be re-
modeled so that the drain pipes
would not run uphill.

“That, too, in spite of the fact that

Christ,” the speaker said. “It con-
sisted of wrought copper pipes laid
in mortar, and was duly provided
with a pitch, in the right direction.”

Sees Striking Contrast

The striking squalor in which the
modern Egyptian laborer or farmer
lives, contrasted with the wealth and
luxury of Alexandria; the juxtaposi-
tion of modem railways and ancient
donkey tracks; and the startling dif-
ference between the fertility of the
Nile banks and the deserts on either
side, were other antithses brought
out by Prof. Allen.

And still I could not help but hear
The voices of a pair right near.

I’d rather read your eyes than books;
I liked you at the first sly glance,
Well, how about a date perchance?”
Said she, “You’re fresh, now never

I’ll give you a piece of my mind!”
“Aw, don’t,” he said as his face lit,
“I’m sure you need it, every bit!!”

Dear Turk:

My Spring vacation was wasted. I
know now that I could have used
some of that time to good advantage
in sharpening my ice-skates!

THE Gaylord, Minn., entry comes
from a school with twenty-seven boys.
When Fritz Crisler invited them the
superintendent declared a vacation,
and the entire group came down to
root On the other hand, the super-
intendent of schools in Zanesville,
Ohio, resigned from his position be-
cause, against his principles, the cham-
pionship team was excused from
classes in order to compete. Ques-
tion??

B Yourself!

Sir:

This entire University is nothing
but a C. & A. school. But the trou-
ble is they always give the other fel-
low’ the A’s!	—Julie

(Senior* at Harvard University
just take an examination over all
their past college courses before they
are awarded their degrees.)
We do admit the school is good,
Since that perforce we must—
But while we call it Fair Harvard,
It’s all the same Unjust!

THE following contributors to the
Whistle will appear Monday after-
noon in the Maroon office to have
their pictures taken for the Cap and
Gown: GeoG, Atlas, The Constant

time? Monday at 2:30.
