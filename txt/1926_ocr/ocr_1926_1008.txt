UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1926

It looks as if
the club girls will
have a busy
week. . . .

WHAT OF
IT?

^Geot^eMn^nstem

At seven o’clock yesterday morning,
the open season on rushing began for
the women’s clubs. The hysteria will
last a week. It will be interesting
while it lasts, to the sideline observer.
But God help the poor mortal who
happens to get between any of the
prize bags of the season and the mob
bearing down on her! I am going to
watch it from the belfry of Mitchell
Tower: there I ought to be reasonably
safe. My advice to the rest of the
campus—those not personally interest-
ed in the business of rushing—is to
stay within doors until things return
to normal. It won’t be long—short,
but hardly, I think, particularly
sweet.

* * * *

All rushing seasons, as I see them
are more or less a bunk process on
both sides. The clubs (whether they
be men’s or women’s) haven't got any-
thing much to shout about in most
cases, but they try to make the rushee
think they have. The rushee is in the
same fix, and his energy goes into at-
tempting to convince the clubs he is
bigger and better than casual inspec-
tion seems to warrant. It's all hokum
but neither side will admit it. If they
did, where on the one hand would
there be just cause for all this hue
and cry to get together a delegation
to “. . . carry the ideals of the old
frat on,” and where on the other the
desire to do so?

* • * *

If the underlying basis of bunk were
cut out. however, much of the sport
of the chase would be lost. So it is
retained. The fraternities do pretty
well in spreading the old oil about, but
the clubs are the real past .masters in
the art. No holds are barred. Every-
thing goes—during the legal two min-
utes and any other time. If the tale
of club rushing were written, it would
undoubtedly result in some of the
darkest pages in history. One feels
that the De Medici ladies must have
been clubwomen.

* * * *

Past rushing seasons have outlined
the tactics the girls follow pretty thor-
oughly. The cardinal principle in the
program, it appears, is "when in doubt,
sob convulsively on the rushee's shoul-
der.” This rarely fails to produce an
effect, but as the rushees are just as
much women as the rushers, it is us-
ually very difficult to tell in advance
just what that effect is going to be.
Sometimes, as the girls say, it sews
’em up; on other occasions it results
in the rushee going the other thing,
sad to say. Girls for ages past have
been inscrutable from the point of
view of man; the rushing season brings
out the signal truth that they are
quite as inscrutable to others of their
own sex.

* * ♦ ♦

But to turn our analysis of the situa-
tion upon the other angle of the busi-
ness—the lines of conduct followed
out by the rushee during the week—
we find that the little girls on the other
end of the affair have their own tricks
of the trade, varying individually as
the individuals’ degrees of cunning
vary, to follow. Some of thes tricks
are fairly common to all—wearing
one’s fur coat in dog days like these,
for example. On their side, the rushee
spare neither time nor expense (for
the week) to get over big, or as big
as possible. It’s an intriguing pastime.

♦ ♦ ♦ ♦

In a few days the sobbing (read lit-
erally) will start. In a few more the
returns will begin to come in. Then
there will be more and wetter feats of
crying—whether the rushee takes the
pin, or whether she doesn’t. By the
time the red, red robin goes south,
there’ll probably be an end to the sob,
sob, sobbin’. They are not long—the
weeping and the laughter!

SOPHS DANCE AT SHORELAND

Classes Nominate at Chapel Next Week

CLUB RUSHING IS IN FULL SWING

ELECTIONS ARE
SCHEDULED FOR

ENSUING WEEK

Undergraduate Council
Decrees Immediate

Balloting

Under the recent decision of the Un-
dergraduate council that class Elec-
tions be held early in the quarter in-
stead of late in November, nomination
for class officers will begin next Tues-
day. at Sophomore chapel.

Juniors Elect Wednesday

On Wednesday the Juniors will be-
gin their electioneering, while the Se-
niors will wait until Thursday chapel
to begin their selection of officers.

Nominations for presidents, vice-
presidents, secretaries, and treasurers
may be made either from the floor or
by petition of ten signatures to the
president of the Undergraduate coun-
cil.

Elections Aid Councils

The elections will be held next
week following nominations, it is an-
nounced. The early date has been set
to enable the presidents of the three
classes to take their places as members
of the Council and to aid the classes
in getting a good start in their work.

French Plumbers
Responsible For
American ‘Damn’

“I don’t give a damn!” isn't what it's
cracked up to mean; insists Mr. O. F.
Bond, instructor of French at the
University. The sinister or immoral
significance attached to it is wholly
a misunderstanding.

The expression, "I don’t give a
damn,” was originally similar in mean-
ing to our own, “I don't give a con-
tinental!” It was originated a cen-
tury or so ago by tinkers, which is an-
other name for travelling plumbers. In
soldering two pipes together they used
a small, almost worthless piece of wood
to mold the molten metal. This was
called a dam; and hence the expres-
sion. Some bright person unintention-
ally added an “n” to it. thus barring
the expression from polite society.

SARGENT SPEAKS AT
LECTURES MONDAY

Prof. Walter Sargent, chairman of
the Art department, will speak at the
first meeting of the Art club, Wednes-
day at 4, in Classics 10. Plans will be
made for the activities of the quarter.
At a tea to be given soon, Mr. Lorado
Taft, prominent Chicago sculptor will!
speak.

According to a tentative program,
a tour through the American Painters
Exhibition will be conducted in No-
vember by Prof. Sargent.

Cap and Gown To

Hold New Tryouts

Freshmen interested in the publi-
cation of the Cap and Gown will
be given another opportunity. New
tryouts will be held in Lex. 3:30
Friday. It is important that all be
present at this meeting which will
end in time for the regular publi-
cation meeting which will be held
at 4:00.

Campus or Prison?

Camera the Same

Do yoii imagine that your “C”
book picture makes you look like a
convict? If that thought comes to
your mind, it is nobodys fault, for
the camera is meant to make you
look that way.

The camera that is used to take
“C” book pictures is like those used
by the federal government prisons,
and large corporations for identifi-
cation purposes.

Cameras of this design emphasize
certain features which insure accur-
ate identification. The University
camera has been found to be high-
ly practical, and. while it may not
produce artistic masterpieces, serves
to prevent misuse of “C” books.

FRESHMEN DON

CAPSJUESDAY

Second Luncheon Takes

Place Monday Noon

Streamers of green will appear on
the campus Tuesday. Undoubtedly,
they will be kept parallel to the ground
part of the time. And undeniably
they won’t all the time.

This meeting at the circle at 12 will
' formally start the activities of the
candidates for the Freshman honor so-
ciety. The gatherings each noon will
be in charge of a board of directors, the
members of which will be announced
in next Tuesday’s issue of The Daily
Maroon.

Score club. Skull and Crescent, and
Iron Mask will carry out the ideas of
the Board.

The second of the series of four
Green Cap club luncheons will be held
Monday noon at 12:30 in the Church
of the Disciples of Christ. It is re-
ported that President Mason will be
unable to attend this luncheon, but it
is rumored that Dean Simpson will
make the main address.

OWNER OF C BOOK
MAY BUY TWO BIDS
TO BIGGEST GAMES

Students holding “C” books may ap-
ply for two tickets for the Illinois and
Wisconsin games instead 'of one as
was the rule formerly, according to a
new ruling made by the football tic-
kets committee yesterday. The com-
mittee, however reserves the right to
reduce the application to one ticket
if they are unable to fill all applica-
tions.

Pres. Mason Gives
Dinner Tonight For

Prussian Professor

Pres. Max Mason will entertain for
Dr. Moritz J. Bonn, professor in the
College of Commerce at the University
of Berlin, at a dinner tonight at 6:30
in the Quadrangle club. Dr. Bonn
will lecture this afternoon at 4:30 in
Harper Mil on “The Problems of
German Democracy.”

Dr. Bonn has been active along
political as well as scholastic lines. In
the former field he represented Ger-
many as a delegate at the Versailles
Peace Conference and was later advis-
or to the German Government.

Prof. Scott Now
the Genuine Coach

“Signullls: 23-16-9-24-13-HIKE!”
And History 242 grabs its books
and tries an end run for a touch-
down to net one major’s credit.

Not that this really happens, but
it might. For statistics reveal that
Artie Scott’s “Expansion of the
World” boys are as familiar to the
gridiron as they are to the history
text. Even more so, some wise
cracker adds. The following men
are in the class: Spence, end; Weis-
, low, tackle; Heitman, guard, Rouse
and Baker, center, Borden, guard,
Lewis, tackle, Kelley, end, Dygert,
quarter, McKinney, half, Gleason,
half, and Marks, fullback.

HONOR GROUPS
WILL SPONSOR

PLEDGE DANCE

Initial Function of Social
Season Set for

October 29

By Milton S. Mayer

While the lapping waves of that
nearby mudhole, Lake Michigan, lend
romance to the occasion, the sumptu-
ous ballroom of the Shoreland Hotel
will echo with the dancing feet of
those who attend the Women’s Pledge
dance, first social function of the win-
ter season, October 29.

The new south side hostelry was
selected for this year’s affair by Rob-
ert Harman, of Score Club, and C.
R. Murphy, of Skull and Crescent.
For the first time in campus history
the two sophomore honor societies
have combined in sponsoring the hop
that has hitherto been known as the
Score Club dance. The chairman of
the dance, given annually in honor of
the women’s clubs’ pledges, expect
five hundred couples to attend.

Shoreland Is Ideal

“In selecting the Shoreland we be-
lieve we have found not only the
finest location on the South Side but
one of the most beautiful and exclu-
sive hotels in the city,” Murphy said.
“Ideally located at Fifty-fifth street on
the lake, it is far enough from the hum
and buzz of city affairs to give the
impression of a country club. The
spacious lobbies and lounges are a
particularly inviting attraction, and
the main ballroom, accommodating five
hundred couples easily, is the best we
have seen yet.”

Realizing that October 22, the date
first set, was too imminent for the
completion of their elaborate plans, the
honor men gave themselves one more
week leeway and scheduled the ball for
October 29, to let the campus public
know that this year’s affair will be
bigger and better, if for no other rea-
son.

Bids Out Monday

Bids should be on sale Monday, ac-
cording to Harman. They will be dis-
tributed among the sundry fraternities
and other sales points on the campus.
Flaming youth, financially lean after a
siege of tuition, books, subscriptions,
and tickets tfill groan heartily at the
“2.50 per” sign outside the door, but
will pay and pay until it hurts, for
who wants to miss the Pledge Dance,
premier event of the social season?

SATURDAY MIXERS
START THIS WEEK

The first of a series of mixers wil|
be held next Saturday in Reynolds
club immediately following the Mary-
land game. The purpose of this enter-
tainment is to stimulate a feeling of
friendship among the students them-
selves, and between the students and
the persons from the visiting school.
The mixers are annual entertainment
sponsored by the University. The vis-
iting team, their followers, the stu-
dents and alumni of the University are
urged to attend.

Romans Invite All
to Initial Meeting

All men in the University wish-
ing to become affiliated with a so-
cial organization are invited to be
present at the first meeting of the
Romans. Tuesday, Oct. 12 at 3:30
p. m. in the Reynolds Clubhouse,
Room A. The Romans is an organ-
ization open to all non-fraternity
men.

NON-FRATERNITY”

'THE fraternity rushing season is over. Several hundred
* young fellows are wandering about the campus, somewhat
self-consciously, wearing the buttons which advertise their
pledgeship to some fraternity. Several hundred other young
fellows, equally self-conscious, are wandering about without
pledge buttons.

And the same old irrational and cruel distinctions between
fraternity men and non-fraternity begin to be made. No recog-
nized distinctions, of course, or no distinctions which upright
fraternity men wil admit; but nevertheless real and cutting dis-
tinctions, which reach most deeply into the business of living at
this university.

“Our problem,” said President Mason recently, “is not a frat-
ernity problem. It is a non-fraternity problem.” And so it is.
It is possible that many university men are happier for not being
in fraternities. But it is not to be denied that many men who
are not in fraternities are keenly unhappy because of it.

We have no ready-made remedy to offer. We endorse, how-
ever, any attempt which may be made to give non-fraternity men
the things they are missing. And we charge all fraternity men
to be liberal, very liberal.

SYNTHETIC TRADITIONS

WrE hear that the management of the University Commons is
allowing grime to accumulate on the windows of its edifice.
The University is but thirty-six years old. Because of its
extreme youth it could not, under the old fashioned system of
allowing traditions to grow up, have obtained many in this short
period. But our modern age, so clever in discovering processes
for the manufacture of washing machines, has now invented
quicker, more scientific methods of tradition growing. Traditions
as well as washing machines, can now be quickly and cheaply
produced. Both are mentioned in the pages of Sears-Roebuck-
prices are given, plus postage of course. Ah, the miracles of
science!

In conformity with the new system, whereby traditions are
consciously established every year, the Commons management al-
lows dirt to accumulate on the windows of the building wherein
many of us must perforce take our meals. Our traditions, they
say, must have a setting which lends them the color and romance
of age. Because the windows of Oxford are almost opaque
through age we too must have opaque windows. Traditions, even
though shiny and new, must be made to look hoary. And so the
windows in the Commons are dirty.

We wonder if the Buildings and Grounds department has
heard of youth and originality. The existence of universities
proves that youth is not wholly to be despised, and if human youth
is not wicked there can hardly be any reason for shame at the
youth of a university. While we attempt to create overnight the
traditions which can grow but slowly through the course of cen-
turies, we are imitating older and thoroughly worthy institutions.
And while we imitate we cannot be in the first rank. We are al-
most moved to quotations ....

And if we cannot be decidedly original, let us be natural.
To be original is awfully hard, and no one can condemn us if we
fail. Oxford is a great and fine university, but this is Chicago. .

SEASON TUESDAY

Secure Four Fields For
Games; Entries

Pour In

By the beginning of next week ev-
erything will be in readiness for the
opening of the touchball season ac-
cording to an announcement made by
Manager Harry Hagey. The first
games will be played on Tuesday and
the'fields are to be put into condition
over the week-end. All necessary
equipment has already been purchased
while a staff of experienced officials
has been arranged for.

Entry lists have been pouring in all
week, which speaks well of the eager-
ness of the various organizations, and
bodes well for the success of the com-
ing season. All entries must be in by
this evening.

Foor Fields

Four fields will be continually in
use. One of these is to be reserved
strictly for non-fraternity affairs.

The location of the various fields is
as follows:

Field No. 1—South east corner of
60th and Woodlawn.

Field No. 2—Southwest corner of
60th and Woodlawn.

Field No. 3—59th and Cottage.

Field No. 4—59th and Maryland.

Ineligibility lists will be mailed to-
day, as varsity and freshmen football
men will not be able to compete.

Manager Hagey looks for a good
turnout on the opening day. “If the
intromural department is to have a
completely successful season,” stated
Hagey, “it is necessary for every or-
ganization on the campus to give its
complete support. It is essential for
every team to show up on schedule
time so as to not to delay the day’s
games.

Kappa Sig Frosh
Start Grid War

This football fever spreads—even
to the individual pledge ranks at
the fraternity houses. Witness this
little incident. The pledges of Psi
U. and Kappa Sigma consider
themselves superior to the rest of
the campus neophytes when it
comes to actually playing the game.
They will engage in a football game
Saturday morning to settle this
dispute as to which is the stronger
delegation. The team that wins
will immediately issue an open chal-
lenge to the freshman of all other
houses. It is expected that the
challenge will not be cast in vain
and that the campus yearlings will
keep competition hot for the next
few weeks.

RENEW RIVALRY

IN IOWA BATTLE

Iowa City, la., Oct. 8—A football
team came out of the University of
Iowa to beat a Michigan eleven at Ann
Arbor two years ago.

A Hawkeye quarterback, Leland
Parkin played the game of his career.
So brilliant was his work, climaxing
a great year that Big Ten critics
named him for an all-conference post.

Hardly less brilliant was Tod Rock-
well, Michigan quarter but his luster
was just enough tarnished by Parkin
to relegate him to the mythical second
team. The game was the deciding fac-
tor after the Iowa and Michigan se-
niors had been tied in the critics’ favor
all season.

Rockwell chose the coaching pro-
fession for his career. Parkin elected
to finish his law course and act as
assistant coach at the University of
Iowa. He passes on his knowledge of
backfield craft to the young Iowa

WRESTLERS AND

TANKMEN START

UMBERING UP

Coaches Vorres and Mac-
Gillivray Issue First
Call To Aspirants

Year round sports at the University
are getting off to a real start this
year. The wrestlers swung in to their
first session of the season early this
week and in a few short weeks they
will be going at full stride. Some of
the veterans of last year’s squad have
already reported but there are many
more who will report later.

Several of the prbspective team for
the coming year are at present trying
out for positions on the football squad.
Levine 117 pound and Simberling 158
pounds, both numeral men of the ’29
team hate already turned out however,
as have a number of new incoming
freshmen.

Swimmers Warming Up

Coach MacGillivray has already his
swimming prospects well on the way
in the matter of conditioning. The
tank is crowded daily with men warm-
ing up for their various stroke prac-
tise. The varsity squad has almost
the exact lineup of last year’s team
back. Gilchrist. Petrolowitz last year’s
water polo captain, and Lane are the
only veterans who are micsing.

Veterans Return

Captain Noyes, Jerry Greenburg,
Rittenhau and all of the other stars
have returned however and are doing
sparkling work in their early practice
meetings. Hough, a last year’s num-
eral man in the dashes has also turned
out. The Frosh squad is well balanced
but has no real luminaries. Vedder in
the 220, Stephenson back stroke, New-
field in the breast stroke and Hansen,
a dash man who will develop well if
he sticks out, all look good.

Quakers Take Out
“Quake” Insurance

No chances are being taken by
the University of Pittsburgh on
having to do without its football
stadium. Recently it took out earth-
quake insurance on the new $2,000,-
000 steel and concrete stand, re-
ceiving a low rate due to its geo-
graphical location. It is the only
stadium so insured, according to
records.

Whether Pittsburgh also intends
to take a fire insurance policy on
the structure was not indicated.

BADGERS READY

FOR JAYHAWKERS

Madison, Wis., Oct. 8, 1926.—Coach
George Little's fighting Badgers are
slated for a light practice at Camp
Randall Stadium this afternoon in prep-
aration for the inter-sectional battle
with Kansas’ Missouri Valley eleven
tomorrow. The Wisconsin coach has
ordered a light workout, which will
consist of signal drill and some punt-
ing, drop-kicking and place kicking.

The Jayhawker squad, coached by
Franklin “Baldy” Cappon, who will be
remembered as one of Michigan’s
greatest plunging fullbacks, and led by
Captain Harold Zuber, 200 pound trip-
le-threat back, arrived here this morn-
ing early thirty-five strong and lim-
bered up at the stadium early this af-
ternoon. The visitors appear to be a
strong machine, as they have the size
and experience, combined with the
Michigan system of coaching.

The Cardinal staff has been hard at
work all week ironing out the rough
(Continued on page 4)

By Hugh O. Potter

No longer will the campus football
enthusiasts be kept in the dark on
why the Maroons became musical last
Saturday for A. A. Stagg, “The Grand
Old Man” has let the secret out.

“I hadn’t thought of marching the
squad out singing until I went into the
dressing room and saw that the men
were nervous. Then I decided upon
the move. It was just psychology,”
explained the Dean of all football
mentors

When asked if he intended to con-
tinue the practice Mr. Stagg refrained
from definitely committing himself,
answering, “I don’t know.”

Reversing the order the famous
coach quizzed his interviewers, “Did
you hear it?”

The answer being in the affirmative
Stagg continued:

“What did you think of it? I read
the next day that the team sang ‘The
Song of the C’.” The song the team
really sang was “The March of the
Maroons.”)

While being assured that the singing
was impressive as well as unique, a
stray football whizzing uncomfortably
near the coach drew his attention and
ended the interview.

While a few of the newspaper re-
ports of the game failed to feature the
Maroons’ musical act others “played it
up” in good style. The “Big Ten
“Big Ten Weekly” in its story of the
contest says:

“Perhaps the singing Maroon athlet-
ic choir will come to be more famous
than the “Praying Colonels from Cen-
tre College.”

“Will the Maroons sing again?”

The question will be answered Sat-
urday afternoon at 2:30 o’clock.

HEAVY MARYLAND

TEAM TO ARRIVE
AT NOON TODAY

Maroon Line Gets Final
Workout In Dummy

Scrimmage

The Maroons went through the last
hard drill of the week last night. It
was much the same as the previous
sessions—stress was laid on the work
of the line. The linemen were taught
in detail how to handle the Maryland
plays as illustrated by the Freshmen
who have been using them with mark-
ed success throughout the week. There
was no actual scrimmage.

Reports have it that the Maryland
team will arrive in the city at noon
today. They have been drilling on
their offense for the most part of the
week, perfecting their timing which
was faulty in their game with South
Carolina last week.

Maryland Lineup

Maryland will put a heavy line on
the field Saturday. Likely starters are
Adams, 180 pounds, and Keenan, 196,
ends; Zulick, 198, and Leatherman,
190, tackles; Wondrack, 192, and
Fletcher, 191, guards; Bafford, 158.
Captain Stevens and quarterback
Boyd are the midgets of the team
weighting under 150 pounds.

Neither team will be handicapped
by injuries. Several of the Maroons
are troubled with slight bruises but
these will not hamper their work when
game time is due. Maryland was in
poor condition when they played South
Carolina but should be improved phy-
sically as they have had extended prac-
tice sessions during the first days of
this week.

Stagg has kept his first string backs
out of hard scrimmage but has given
them plenty of work otherwise.

feeling for a long time * * * “Watch the Univer-

are to echo just this sentiment, we couldn’t have
worded it any better * * *

He was writing today about Herrick’s ’’Brains of

And he has already told his readers that we have
published ‘‘a book that the intelligent person
should pounce on with a whoop of joy” (‘‘The
Nature of the World and of Man”) * * *

Our customers presumably are not so vociferous in
their support of what we are doing, but the prim
columns of our sales reports and the worn look of
our shipping clerk are all the evidence we need to
assure us that we have a wonderful list of new

“See you, and raise you ten!”

A soft clinking sound came from

“Seven, babies, seven for yo’ papa!”
