Breasted’s Lecture

By Milton S. Mayer

When Cobb hall rose toweringly
above the Midway in 1896 and Presi-
dent William Rainey Harper handed
degrees to twenty-five men and wom-
en, little did the frock-coated, hoop-
skirted passers-by dream that on
June 11, forty years hence, they
would return to find the ivy-covered
walls of Cobb a small part of the
“city gray.” .

But the “boys" of ’96 will meet
again with the men and the classes
that followed them when the Uni-
versity Alumni association entertains
the old grads at its thirty-fifth an-
niversary, June 10 to 15. Plans for
the 1926 reunion were announced
yesterday by Adolphe G. Pierot,
Alumni secretary.

Swanson In Charge

Harry R. Swanson, ’17, is chair-
man of this year’s reunion which
promises tn he the largest and most
significant gathering since the first
convocation. Among the features of
the occasion is a lecure on the work
of the University in the Near East
by Professor James H. Breasted, who
has just returned to this country
from Egypt and Palestine,

Invitations were mailed today to
all alumni. The events will begin
with a “C” dinner at Bartlett, on
June 10. June 11 is set aside for
Class Day. The classes of 1886, 1896,
1901, 1906, 1911, 1921, and 1925
will hold anniversary celebrations
at different points of the campus.
That evening will witness the senior
class dinner, followed by Prof.
Breasted’s lecture.

Saturday, June 12, is Alumni Day.

RECORDING ORCHESTRA TO
PLAY AT ANNUAL FORMAL

TONSOR1AL TROPHY
AWARDED TO BEST
BUSH NEXT FRIDAY

Black ones, blonde ones, thin
ones, bushy ones, such are growths
inappropriately called mustaches ap-
pearing on the upper lips of the Se-
nior romeos as the race is rounding
the last lap. The undergraduates as
a whole are rising to their tiptoes
in excitement, peering with their
microscopes, and laying last moment
bets on their heroes. For Friday
noon, in front of Cobb hall. Doc
Bratfish will clang the judges’ bell
and the winner of the annual Senior
classic will be named.

Excitement, sorrow, ridicule, and
encouragement have been the lot of

Florida winter resorts will be rep-
resented by the booths at the annual
Quadrangle Fete, sponsored by Y. W.
C. A. to be held in Hutchinson quad-
rangle at each performance of “Wal-
lie Watch Out.” The scheme of the
decorations was chosen to harmonize
with one of the acts of “Wallie Watch
Out,” which is laid at Coral Gables.
Palms and bright colored awnings
will carry out the Floridan illusion.

As in previous years each booth
has been placed under the supervision
of a class. At the freshman booth
of which Violet Holmes will preside,
flowers will be sold. Punch and pop
will be sold at the sophomore booth
under the direction of Eloise Kresse.
The junior booth will handle candy
and peanuts, and the senior, ice
cream cones, under Miriam Walker
and Helen Wooding respectively.

In order to avoid confusion and
delay, ten cent tickets will be sold
by members of the Y. W. finance
committee. This scheme proved very
successful at Settleent Night. Profits
of the fete will go to the Y. W.
fund.

WELFARE EXECUTIVE

SPEAKS HERE TODAY

One of the leading social workers of
the country, Mr. Rowland Haynes of
Cleveland, will speak today at 4:30 in
Cobb 215 on "The Organization and Ad-
ministration of the Cleveland Welfare
Federation.” Mr. Haynes has been ac-
tive in this work for many years and
has succeeded in raising the largest
amount of money ever obtained for a
municipal charity organization in Cleve-
land

the best examination paper based on a
knowledge of current events. The ex-
amination was held May 1. The award
I consisted of $250 in cash and a gold
• medal.

I The examination was sponsored by the
Political Science department of the Uni-
versity. Profs. Quincy Wright and H.
D. Lasswell were the judges of the pa-
pers submitted by the fourteen contest-
ants.

This examination is carried on in
twelve other universities in the country.
The winners in each university will meet
later on for a grand prize of $500. The
1 Times has instigated this contest to cre-
ate a desire among university students to
readthe newspapers.

Plan Parties

A number of social organizations'
connected with the University have
reserved blocks of seats for the
show, as have the clubs and frater-
nities of the campus. It is probable
that there will also be many Black-
friar parties, as has been the custom
in the past. Some of the fraternity
houses are planning receptions after
the show’.

Costumes, which were received
yesterday, are said to be the most
strikingly beautiful in the history of
Blackfriars.

to be different—something never tried
before—and possibly, never again.”

the secretary in 45 Rosenwald hall. The
entries receiving prizes are now mounted
in an album and may be seen in Ros-
enfald library.

The contest is being held again this
year with many photographs and slides
being sent in, according to Mr. John T.

contest has five divisions: Photographic

Richard Henry Little, the gentle-
man who writes the column in the
Tribune, Keith Preston, and a few

have accepted invitations to the big
Mu Alpha dance to be held at North-
western next Friday night. There has
been a great demand for tickets on
the Evanston campus so that the
few Leo Stone still has in his pos-
session may be called in to supply
the demand.

Russo-Fiorito’s orchestra will sup-
ply music at the dance, and a select
group of the best Whistlers nr. the
campus will add their notes to the
dance fund. A mere 1.79 w’ill pur-
chase a ticket to the party as long
as there are any to buy.

Mu Alpha is a national fraternity
of college newspape rhumorists. The
Northwestern chapter has sent these
invitations to Chicago to see what
the local bunch looks like. Stone, the
editor of the Whistle, thinks they are
a great bargain at the price.

Conversion of Ida Noyes
Into Gay Country Club

To Begin Soon

For the first time in its long and
eventful history, Ida Noyes hall
will be gayly decorated and the
country club May 28. Although no
caddies will be waiting for bags or
golfers running about in knickers,
the representatives from all four
classes who will assemble at the In-
ter-class hop will enjoy all the at-
mosphere of a rural country place
not a block from campus.

Plans are being put into action
and work is about to begin for the
decorating of the lawns and gardens
around Ida Noyes. The balconies
w|ll bp gayly decorated and the
space behind the hall will be con-
verted into a lawn fete where the
four classes, the men in white flan-
nels and blue coats, and the women
in formal gowns, will promenade.

Music

By George Morgenstern

“The band,” said Mr. Graham Ha-
gey, senior Interclass Hop leader, yes-
terday, “that will play at this year’s
Hop is one of the most superior bands
that has ever played at a Hop or
anything else. This statement,” con-
tinued Mr. Hagey, “may seem to you
a little broad at first thought, but it
is indubitably the truth. The band in
question is Charley Dornberger’s
band.

“When I say,” Mr. Hagey went on,
“that some fifteen bands were con-
sidered—that out-of-town bands com-
ing to the city, bands from the city
now out of town, and bands in the
city now in town were considered—
and that from all this number, not
Eric Diefendorfer’s, not Ike Hogan-
boom’s, not Dave Peyton’s or Doggy
'Chink’s, but Charley Dornberger’s
was the one selected, you will imme-
diately recognize that Charley Horn-
berger’s is a real band.”

Harry Confirms Statement

This statement was later confirmed
by Mr. Harry Hagey, freshman lead-
er of the Hop. “While reservations
must be sometimes made on my re-
spected brother’s statements,” said
Mr. Harry Hagey, “I believe that in
this case he has, if anything, under-
stated the case. Yes, indeed, Charley
Dornberger’s is a band that will send
the collegians home happy.”

Parker Hall and Betty Graham,
junior Hop leaders, were the ones who
ran down Mr. Dornberger and his
nine men for the Hop. Hall supple-
mented the brothers Hagey’s words
with a series of statistics intended to
clea nup any lingering doubts as to
the quality of Charley Dornberger’s
band.

Comes From New York

Hotel,” said Hall, “until just recent-
ly—May 1, to be exact. The band is

Those silk stockings again.

Simon Benson, builder and rebuild-

print with his five hundred pair of
ladies hosiery donated by the Wayne
Knitting Mills for the main and sim-
ple purpose of bandaging his dry-
docked athletes whose nether limbs
are on the bum. Blackfriars needed
hosiery to give the shapely legs of
their chorus girls some heavy sex
appeal, so Paul Cullom, unblushing-
ly approached our friend Simon and
asked for fifty pair.

“Sure,” says Simon, “as long as
they give ’em back.” And for a
while he meditated. “But say, guy,”
calling after the disappearing Black-
friar, ‘how about a couple of comps
for the opening night?”

But the Friar was out of ear-shot.

SMITH DISCUSSES THE BAND

“THE University of Chicago Band is a great institution, isn’t it?

1 we remarked by way of conversation to Smith while we were
striding across the quadrangles yesterday.

“Yes, it is,’ returned Smith, cordially.

“It has picked up since the new uniforms came,” we said. “The
men are really trying to gain a place among the bands of the Big
Ten.”

"Exactly," said Smith.

"Everyone knows," we went on, "what a great effect a first
rate band can have at a football game—how a team with failure star-
ing it in the jaws will turn defeat into victory when they hear rousing
music.”

“They sure did."

This, we resumed, after a slight hesitation, "is what the Band
is striving for—to be a credit to the Universtiy and an inspiration to
the team. And they will do it, too!"

"Sure,” Smith said.

Encouraged, we continued, "picture the Band next Fall march-
ing onto the field before the first game, every man keyed up to his
responsibility .and with blare of brass proclaiming the glory of Chi-
cago to the eager thousands.”

“It sure is, ’ rejoined Smith enthusiastically.

EXPERT TELLS OF
TRAINING NEEDED
IN SELLING BONDS

Present Conditions Demand
Greater Preparation

Of Salesmen

By J. T. Seuss, of Halsey, Stuart n Co.

Formerly a college man who wished to
enter the bond business was placed under
the necessity of gathering all his infor-
mation by experience alone. A com-
plete course of study to equip him for
the field he was entering was almost un-
known. If the young man showed the
proper amount of initiative he soon 'ac-
quired an accumulation of knowledge
necessary for the conduct of his business.

Changing conditions, however, have
rendered this method or preparation in-
adequate. The bond houses themselves
recognize this fact, and a number of the
larger ones have training schools which
a man must attend before he is allowed
to start actual selling work. Likewise,
the colleges and universities are provid-
ing many special courses for men study-
ing for the business.

This is necessary because the invest-
ment has reached a point where it is
really a profession. Those anticipating
entrance into this field must, therefore,
prepare themselves as they would if they
planned on the practice of law, medicine,
engineering or any of the well-known
professions.

People will not knowingly go to a poor
laywer or physician, neither will they
continue to do business with an irrespon-
sible salesman or bond house. The suc-
cessful bond man is one who has built
up a substantial and permonent clientele,
in fact he occupies a position with his
clients which is similar to that a phy-
sician holds with his patients.

To occupy such a position it is neces-
sary, among other things, to be thor-
oughly familiar with, and be able to dis-
cuss with intelligence, the fundamental
principles regulating business and finance.
The commerce courses offered in the
larger colleges and universities make
it possible for the colege men to ac-
quire this understanding through
study of the many subjects offered.

The development of keen competition
in the business makes success in this field
largely dependent upon the degree of
understanding that the bond man has re-
garding his client’s own problems and
requirements. Confidence cannot be
constructed and maintained unless the
bond man has a liberal education in
general economics and finance. This
is readily understood when we realize
that the investment business in both
the buying and selling departments
ise very closely allied to all forms of
business enterprise.

It would seem advisable, therefore, for
the undergraduate who is' looking for-
ward to entering the bond business to

select his subjects with the idea in mind
of preparing for the work he expects
follow. It is important that the larger
portion of his time should be given to
the study of commerce and finance, with
major sequence in finance.

Do not think of the bond business as
an ordinary selling organization. It is
essentially a highly specialized and tech-
nical business and also* a highly com-
petitive one, and the success of a new
man is dependent upon his ability to treat
practically any customer’s case from the
standpoint of the specialist. He should,
therefore, be continually striving to place
himself upon the plane of the profes-
sional adviser.

As you can readily understand, the
bond business also requires an unusual
amount of reading not only along strictly
financial lines, but on significant ad cur-
rent economic topics as well. You should
read the financial journals or magazines
regularly, in addition to the financial
page of the morning paper. Such read-
ing will enable any man to lift himself
above the average so that ultimately he
can speak in detail accurately and with
authority on a wide range of subjects.

Another point to be emphasized, if a
student has in mind entering the selling
end of the bond business, is the advis-
; ability of securing selling experience
। during his summer vacations. It does
। not matter greatly what it is that he
sells, just so he learns some of the im-

What Is

A Life
Underwriter?

One whoexecutesand delivers
a life insurance policy. In
other words, a person whose
business it is to offer the
known benefits of life insur-
ance to individuals, to corpor-
ations, to partnerships, etc.

But further, the life under-
writer is one who must con-
vince those clients of the
benefits offered. This means
stimulating contact with hu-
man character, and with large
affairs. Some underwriters
prefer the game of character
and deal mainly with indi-
viduals. Others prefer affairs;
to them is open the great field
of business insurance.

Furthermore, the business of
life underwriting pays highly
for initiative and ability.

And still more, the life under-
writer offers to his client a
commodity which has no risk
in it, does not deteriorate, and

MAROON RACKETMEN "COPlNlTIAL WIN

Norgren Nine on Edge to Avenge Wildcat Defeat; Play Here Today

DELTA UPSILON

BALLMEN EASILY

OVERRUN CHI PSI

McDowell Strikes Out
Fifteen As Mates

Count Runs

In the only game played yester-
day, Delta Upsilon ran away with
Chi Psi by the long score of 12-2.
The score would have been larger
but the D. U. squad let up in the
final three frames and did’nt try es-
pecially hard to make any more
runs. In the other two games, Pi
Lambda Phi forfeited to Kappa Sig-1
ma and Phi Beta Delta forfeited to1
Tau Kappa Epsilon.

Whiffs Three In Row

McDowell, hurling for the winners
struck out fifteen men during the
seven innings, his most notable cf-1
fort coming in the fifth inning when
he whiffed three men in a row. John-*
son, lacking any semblance of sup-
port, was batted hard by the ram-
paging D. U.’s.

The winners started with a bang
in the first round when they batted
clear around, scoring six runs. Then ,
one or two runs for the next four j
innings until they had piled up a
comfortable 12 run lead. McDowell
grew liberal in the sixth and Chi
Psi’s were able to annex a pair. In
this inning he gave two walks and
after two were down Johnson secured
a double to bring in the only 2 runs
which the Chi Psi’s got. In the re-
maining innings the D. U.’s made no
pretense at obtaining more scores,
wishing the game to come to a close.

Held to Four Run*

The losers were held to four hits
which Blackman and Johnson divid-
ed between them. The victors, on
the other hand, fattened their batting
averages.

Second Round in
Tennis Singles
Now Under Way

Some sixty-four netmen are left
of the 300 original entries submit-
ted to the I. M. office for net com-
petition. The second round of play
is now under way and several men
have already begun to show promise.
The greater percentage of the men
who have survived early play elimin-
ation, are adept racket handlers but
are in need of experience in compe-
tition. This is just what the d? -nrt-
ment in charge wants, to fit a num-
ber of men for varsity material of
coming years.

De Blois, unattached net whizz, is
rapidly eliminating all comers with
ease. Sure shooting, tricky pl acing
and a cool head are the assets of this
promising tourney man. Faymor,
another unattached entry will he the
target for De Blois’ next round.

Roque, probable winner of the
tournament, survived all cuts hut one
on the Varsity and is now trying
his luck and skill for University
Champion honors. Roque will play
Baker, Alpha Delt, who also has a
mean swing and a good eye for the
tapes. Roque’s style of play is re-
lentless, just one terrific whack after
another. Doc Molander seems to
think that all chances joint toward
this unattached entry for leading
honors.

Dick Ferris and Chuck Gaskill,
both of the Delta Sigma Phi, are
another two men who are expected
to play in the finals. Gaskill is divid-
ing his time between pitching indoor
and twinging th? raquet. This round
must he played by Friday.

Double Net Matches Prove Fast;

Play Semi-finals About May 24th \

Intra-mural doubles tennis is now
well under way, many well played
matches having passed into history.
In last Thursday’s games the Deke
squad showed great form in beating
Kappa Nu, 6-1, 6-2. George Poole,
of the winners, starred at the net.

Sigma Nu proved a title contender
when it won from the Phi Gams.
Freddy Von Ammon of the losers
caused the Sig Nus such worry with
his hard driven line smashes. Abbott
and Cole, playing for A. T. O., down-
ed the Phi Sigs, 6-4, 8-10, 7-5 in a
thrilling and close match.

Delta Chi showed possibilities of
championship calibre in defeating'
the star aggregation of the Phi Delts.
Merrill, last year’s luminary for Del-
ta Chi, is rapidly approaching his
regular form and should bring his
team quite a distance in this meet.
Chi Psi won from Acacia on a forfeit
and lost to Kappa Nu, 6-0, 6-3 in
the only other match played thus
far.

Six matches are on the cards for
today and six for tomorrow. The

Judging from the calibre of the
early entries to the Track Interschol-

who have made extraordinarily good
performances on the cinders this
year are all planning to fight for na-
tional honors at the big meet here.

Minonck, Illinois, has just sent in
their stellar entry. Only one man’s
name is on their sheet, but according
to all rumors, that one man is a real
star, his record including a leap of
over 11 feet and four inches in the
pole vault.

Northwesterns’ ball nine will ap-
pear on the Midway lot this after-
noon to complete their second en-
gagement of the season with the Ma-
roons, having been successful in
their first through clubbing out a
12 to 5 triumph.

Although the North Shore school
regarded this early victory as an ac-
curate indication of a championship
ball season succeeding games did not
bear out the supposition, and so the
two teams will take the field with
three lossess apiece and only remote
hopes for the Big Ten ^championship.

Remote, because Michigan, Pur-
due, Illinois and Minnesota all have
been faring much better. But the
team which wins the game here this
afternoon may still call itself “in the
winning” while the loser will have
to plan for greater things next sea-
son. So to the optimist there is
something of the championship flavor
hinging on the outcome of the meet-
ing.

Mark* Ineligible

The ineligibility of Wallie Marks
has caused a slight shift in the line-
up. Coach Norgren announced last
night that Macklind would be trans-
ferred from his regular position on
first base to right field while Price
will hold down the initial sack. Gub-
bins will start on the mound with
Macklind being held in reserve. Gub-
bins, although somewhat wild in the
Illinois game, showed plenty of stuff,
and with a proper program warming
up, which he lacked in that game,
should breeze through in good fashion
today.

Mill* or Palmer to Hurl

Northwestern will present either
Mills or Palmer with their chucking
job. Both are capable lads and as
Mills was especially effective against
the Maroons in the first game and as
Palmer hurled against Iowa Saturday
it appears as if the former will be
the first to be announced by the um-
pire. Although the Purple group are
a dangerous crew of bat swingers
their fielding is far from perfection,
and this defect has enabled their op-
ponents to often gather more runs
than hits.

As a result of the excellent exhib-
ition of the pastime during the Il-
linois battle a sizeable crowd will at-
tend. *

Staggmen Return to
Childhood Days?

Is football becoming a fem-
inine game? A few of the specta-
tors at spring practise the other
day thought so as they gazed at
the session and several of them
even voiced that opinion out loud.
And they considered that they had
reason for their plea, for there
upon the field they saw fifty hus-
ky football men, with broad smiles
upon their swarthy countenances,
complacently and expertly skip-
ping rope!

But those who had their doubts
of the game had their theories sad-
ly shattered. For, it was pointed
out to them that the weather has
been a bit cold of late and several
of the men have suffered stiff
muscles, so to avoid complications,
muscular at least, the coaches
have presribed rope-skipping an
exercise which contrary to pop-
ular belief, is exceedingly excel-
lent for warming up.

FORMER MAROON
GRIDMAN RETURNS

Comes Back to Chicago for
Work After Abscense

Eight years ago, during the S. A.
T. C. year, Chicago had its worst
football team in history. The team
wrecked by enlistment and the draft,
lost every game it played. Moff El-
ton, fullback and captain, was the
only regular left out of the team that
would have taken the field for Chi-
cago if the war hadn’t come on.

Elton was about the only one who
could really do anything on the of-
fense, except for a Negro halfback,
Fouche, who had a lot of speed and
was used by Stagg on wide spread
plays. Fouche was well built and trie
most vicious open field tackler on the
team, besides being a fair ball car-
rier. He simply cut runners down in
the open, and he was fast enough so
they couldn’t get away from him.

Stagg’s lineup in 1918 changed al-
most every Saturday, enlistments
wrecking three entire combinations,
and injuries eliminating a bunch of
other players. Fouche, somehow or
other, was always banged up enough
so he couldn’t get into many games,
and, with few letters given out af-
ter the disastrous year, he didn’t win
a “c.”

WINS IN DOUBLES

MATCHES CLINCH
PURPLE CONTEST

Schaeffer Beats Cohln in ,
Close Match as

Mates Win

By Tom Stephenson

Maroon downed Purple in a hard
fought net battle yesterday after-
noon, and the Chicago netmen reg-
istered their first win of the season
by a 5 to 4 count. This close score
came after a two to one victory for
the Maroons in the doubles contests
had broken the 3 to 3 deadlock of
the singles matches.

Every one of the six Midway rep-
resentatives experienced victory in
this gruelling meet, Capt. Schaeffer,
Shapinsky and Hall cleaning up in
the singles matches, and Drain, Ben-
nett, Hall, and Hudlin winning in the
team play. Phillips was the class of
the Wildcat squad, winning over Hud-
lin in handsome style, and playing a
great part in the lone double victory
of his team. It was a sad day for
Sherrill, Purple captain, who was de-
feated in both his contests.

Schaeffer Win*

Captain Wallie Schaeffer staged
a thrilling comeback in his match
with Colhn to win by a 9-7, 6-4 ver-
dict. Colhn had him at set point in
the first frame, but Wallie fought up
hill to finally annex the set and the
match.

Shapinsky exhibited uncanniness
in downing Captain Sherrill by a 6-3,
6-4 score. The tricky Australian
serve of Sherrill, and the cool playing
and fast foot and headwork of Sha-
pinsky characterized the match. Hall,
the lengthy Maroon, had little dif-
ficulty in disposing of Kuehn, win-
ning 6-2, 6-3.

Phillip* Shine*

Hudlin was upset by the power-
ful service, tricky slice, and exceed-
ingly fast ball of Phillips, who ex-
hibited a clever backstroke. As Hud-
lin, himself, put it after the match,
Phillips delivery was “too fast for
words.” The count was 6-3, 7-5.
Thorpe Drain had a very trying
match on his hands, Howard display-
ing a record breaking come-back to
take the match after Drain had won
the first eleven games straight. With
the first set his at 6-0, the second set
at 5-0, Thorpe had Howard at set
point for a love match. Then How-
ard copped Drain’s stuff to win the
next twelve games straight and the
' match.
