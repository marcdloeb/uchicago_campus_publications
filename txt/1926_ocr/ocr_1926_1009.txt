MARYLAND TEAM THREATENS

INJURIES

MENACE MAROONS

Being as today’s Saturday, it is no
more than just that the readers of this
column get a dose of football in it,
'just as they MAY get one from the
boys on the field. The boys may not
be in good voice or something, so the
conductor of this foot and a half of
paper feels that the followers of the
Maroons should be insured their foot-
ball, even if they have to get it on
this selfsame paper. Not that the boys
who die for old Chicago (and on the
high notes) have not given their loyal
supporters cause for some optimism
on the strength of their exhibitions
so far. The fact is that they have
done rather well, both in practice and
against Florida, in choral and other in-
cidental features of their activity.

TRICKY EASTERN ATTACK

But the situation is darkening rapid-
ly. Mr. Stagg’s boys meet Maryland
today. The easteners may be only
Blue Points on the half-shell for the
Maroons, hut the probability is that, it
will be nHich closer than that. There
is even some fear about the campus
that the Old Line team may do the
unorthodox—forget they’re only a
practice game bunch, and bowl Chi-
cago over. This, the campus fears,
would have an unfortunate effect on
the mental attitude, if any, of the
team, as well as their vaunted esprit
de corps, engendered through nightly
sessions of psalm-singing. In fact, if
anything of the sort happened, it
would be extremely regretable. The
boys might lose the old grip.

Not only is Maryland threatening.»

To win their later-season battles, they
must get all the confidence they can
in these early days by taking as many
engagements as possible and memor-
izing all the songs they can, before
the nights begin to grow harder.

By Milton S. Mayer

Yea, verily, our heads are bloody,
be they unbowed or no.

As the Maroon horseflesh comes
upon the field singing or Charleston-
ing, as the case may be, the manly
face (and body) of Captain Marks is
missing. Captain Marks was endowed
yesterday with what at this writing
appears to be a kicking Charley horse
in his left leg. And a kicking charley
horse—in either leg—is not to be
sneered at. And so "55," the lad tha\
got off three grand passes around these
same parts last Saturday, will not start
the fuss today.

At^l where is young Spence, sopho-
more lad, whose defensive work was
to break up all this criss-cross business
attributed to the Old Liners? Brother
Spence is on the lines with an ankle,
an ankle that failed to repair for the |
doings. Bob’s absence this afternoon
may spell the home towners’ Barthol-
omew, for Coach Curley Byrd is
known to be a whiz on the flanking
plays, the Watner formation and such.

McKinney Has Bad Back

Bert McKinney hasn’t rid himself
of that whoozy back, to tell you folks
the inside stuff, and the Old Man may
see fit to keep him on the sidelines
from whence he has watched most of
the past week's scrimmage. Cameron's
injury leaves .the Staggmen with about
two possibilities for the tackle jobs—
(Continued on page 4)

Plunging from yard to yard and
passing to the doorbell is the pur-
suit of “Five-Yards” McCarty who
is working for the Commercial
Trust, collecting money.

The people that used to shout
from the stands “Put in McCarty,”
at a crucial moment, now cry
“Put him out” as he timidly asks
the payment of a few bad accounts.

Mac says that he often makes as
many as fifteen yards a. morning
and many more throughout the af-
ternoon. To accomplish this new
feat he drives a Chevrolet coupe.

“Collecting money,” said Mc-
Carty, "is great sport. It keeps me
in perfect physical trim and contrib-
utes to my general welfare. I in-
tend to make it my profession.”

And he chewed his Panatelia.

“Our Chicago ”
at Game Today

“Our Chicago,” written by Norman
Reid and one of the features of Black-
friars last spring, is to make its debut
today and if it lives up to the expecta-
tions of its sponsors, it will take its
place beside “Wave the Flag” and oth-
er famous university songs.

This song was sung last Saturday
by the team, and today the yell-lead-
ers will try to teach it to the student
rooters. It is to be sung at the half
and at the end of the game. Coach
A. A. Stagg and Mr. B. Wilson, band-
master, have taken a great liking to

the song and believe that it will
a hit with the spectators.

Mr. Wilson predicts that, in a
time, “Our Chicago" will be the

don’t consider yourself a real football

making a careful study and gathering
suggestions from football fans and
players for a game that will provide
real football thrills and excitement
anywhere and anytime. He lias just

universally sung and the best known
of all the Chicago songs. He states
that it is one of the finest college songs
that has come to his attention in a long
time. The most unusual thing about
this song is that Reid wrote it while
he was a sophomore, it being the first
time that a member of the lower class-
es has written a song which has met
with such acclaim. The words are to
be found in this year’s “C” Handbook.

scrap with South Carolina and they
appeared and acted the reverse. To-
day may be their turn to play respect-
ably again, especially with last min-
ute injuries dampening the Midwav’s
hopes.

very darkly indeed.

ADVOCATE NEW TYPE
UNIFORMS FOR BAND

Rumors are circulating about the
campus to the effect that the band
will son appear in the new collegiate
style of uniform patterned after

to do much this year at quarter-back
for the Maroons. He played end on
the varsity last year, as there were
several senior quarter-backs. His ath-
letic instinct is quite remarkable, for
he can do anything- that any other
back can do and in addition is a nat-
ural, clever pilot. One of the factors
in his piloting ability is his powerful
inspiring voice. Mac is an all around
athlete, playing both varsity basket-
ball and varsity basketball.

ably or fail dismally. The runs and
passes are all delayed thus giving an
ambitious line all kinds of opportun-
ity to break through and put a stop to
the nonsense.

This game should test the Maroon
pass defense which was noticeably
weak last year. The Florida game
was not a conclusive test. Florida’s
pass plays when both were added up
amounted to two. After using them
a dozen or so times apiece it wasn’t
remarkable that the Maroons managed
to solve and effectively ruin them.
Maryland, we understand, has a varied
assortment. What the Maroons can
do against Maryland’s foxy business
should form a fair basis of prediction
when the Penn, Illinois, Northwestern,
et al, games roll around.

Today’s game should also go a long
way in determining whether the Old
Man’s own aerial offense possesses suf-

those in vogue at the Eastern univer-
sities. The appearance of Dart-
mouth’s band last year, which cre-
ated such a sensation among the
Stagg field football fans is said to
have started this move to do away
with the present “circus” style of
uniform. All those who saw last
year’s Dartmouth game agree that
the green sweatered band from New
Hampshire made the best appearance,
as far as their uniforms went, of any
band that has paraded on Stagg Feld.

If the band is equipped with out-
fits similar to those worn by the Dart-
mouth men, it is expected that they
will consist of a maroon sweater and '
white trousers, with no headwear.

During the past week, the band has
been practicing and drilling in the
preparation of a varied program for
today’s game. It is expected that it
will parade between halve?.

Bert McKinney is a fast back whose
home is in Arizona. His regular posi-
tion on the varsity is at halfback and
when he plays the game he is a migh-
ty hard man to catch and hang onto
at the tackle. He is Captain elect of
the track team and has the same speed
on the turf that he showed on the
cinders. Last year he wop hip “C”
on the varsity and this year he is one
of the most valuable men on the squad.
One hundred and seventy-five pounds
is about his usual weight.

Ken Rouse

Ken Rouse, a junior in school won
his “C” in his sophomore year. He is
a local product, having played his prep
footfall on the Lindblom team. At
present he is playing regular center
on the varsity. Last year he alternated
with Cameron Baker at the same posi-
tion. He has also played in the back-

Students will be permitted to en-

tober 16. This announcement is
made despite all the rulings of the
faculty and the bans on organized
football pilgrimages. They will not
be permitted to make the trip to
Philadelphia, however. The answer
to the mystery created by these two
seemingly opposed statements is that
arrangements have been made to get
play by play radio returns in Mandel
hall.

This broadcast reception has been
arranged by W. A. A. through the
courtesy of the Chicago Daily News
radio station, WMAQ. The game is
scheduled to begin at 1 o’clock, Chi-
cago time, but the doors of Mandel
wil be thrown open at 12:30, so that
it will be advisable to come early.
Twenty-five cents admission is to be
charged.

To lend football atmosphere and
to make the game seem more realis-
tic, those in charge of the affair have

Coach Stagg’s warriors, and Maroon
fans are hoping for the best as they
daily realize that “game by game the
Midway opposition grows tougher
and tougher.”

The big intersectional battle »f
the year is only a week distant, and
the critics will be eyeing today’s
game to see just what Stagg will
have to make it a successful day
when his team journeys eastward.

Purdue, with its heralded aerial
attack will be here to greet the Ma-
roons on their return from Penn, and
fans can be assured that “Stagg
Fears Purdue” may be no joke this
year.

Whenever there is a miscue in one

One evening, in a party of four, I
went to a prominent south side chop
suey house, the place was dimly-light-
ed. Apart from a large main room,
was a smaller room, with the dimmer
lights. The odor of alcohol was dis-

ly condition.

Seated at three long tables was a
party of youngsters, under the influ-
ence of the liquor. As the hour of
twelve drew near one of the girls arose
and put on her coat.

“Oh don’t go yet,” they begged
her, “It is still early. Jimmie’s moth-
er and dad are away on a week-end
trip, and we are going over there to
play cards. Well, if you must go,
have a drink first. Just one! Oh! it
won’t hurt you.” So they pleaded
with her.

of Chicago Tom Eck coached track athletics. Last sppring, after
a hopeless but courageous month in the Cook County Hospital Tom
Eck died. Another month later he was forgotten by the school gen-
erally. But by his friends, and these include all who came into con-
tact with him, Tom’s memory is very much alive.

Tom was a great old fellow. He was not only an athlete him-
self, and a coach of considerable competency, but he was a very
loveable human being. And as for training in manliness and in the
conduct of a friendly, generous life, his influence was better and more
effective than if he had been a more austere, unprochable sort of
fellow.

He was generous, and like all most generous men he was sensitive
to appreciation. The Daily Maroon believes that some record of
his service to the University, and some tribute to his memory should
exist on this campus. In the men’s natatorium a bronze tablet keeps
fresh the memory of “Doc” White, the old swimming coach. Could
not such a memorial be erected in Bartlett Gymnasium to remind
us that Tom Eck worked with us there and made us like him?

FRESHMEN GATHER
FOR PUBLICATIONS

FOR GRANDSTAND CRITICS

JT has been the fad in recent years for the LaSalle street coaching
staff and other “friends” of the University of Chicago to ‘razz”
the Chicago football team and its coaching department. The critics
demand spectacular play and huge scores. They rebuke the Old
Man because he does not produce an Eckersall or a Grange. “Why
did the team lose so many games last year?”, is a repeated question.

It now seems pertinent, therefore, to offer to these garrulous
non-observers some facts that will give them cause for reflection—
the success of this venture, of course, depending upon their some-
what dubious receptive powers.

In the first place, we should inform them that our school, which
they describe as a Colossus, is not only small but actually diminutive
in comparison with the schools which are popularly described as
our ancient rivals. The undergraduate enrollment of the University
of Chicago, from which the football material is drawn, amounts to
approximately twenty-five hundred, much smaller than Indiana,
Purdue and Northwestern, and infinitely smaller than schools such
as Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. But that is nothing. Let the
psuedo-critics consider this: Last year while Michigan and other
Big Ten schools were boasting about the number of former high
school captains that were out for their respective freshmen teams,
Coach Stagg was confronted with a frqeshman aggregation which
included only five former high school first string players, the rest
second string men and novices.

Is it, therefore, such a strange thing that the Chicago team does
not always win? Let us, if only in the interests of fairness, stop
criticizing long enough to honor the team and its coaches; not for
their splendid record alone, but because they have achieved this

record despite so many handicaps.

DR. BONE ASSERTS

Initial Football
Mixer Held At
Reynolds Today

The Future Theological School

REYNOLDS CLUB

Professor Traces Political
Problems of New
Democracy

"There is no direct remedy in consti-
tutional construction for the problems
of Germany—time alone will relieve
the situation,” Dr. Moritz J. Bonn, pro-
fessor in the College of Commerce in
Berlin, Germany, declared yesterday
afternoon, /when he addressed Uni-
versity students in Harper assembly
hall, on the subject of “The Problems
of the German Democracy.”

"Politics.” he continued, “are as
long as life. We will have problems
as long as we continue in th| form of
commonwealths.”

Traces Problems

Dr. Bonn traced the political his-
tory of Germany from the time of the
last emperor, showing how the bu-
reaucracy bad gradually absorbed the
power of administration from the mon-
arch. until it was virtually in control
of Germany.

This resulted in an antagonism for
the new democracy, when it was set
up. after the attempts of the soviet
party to gain control were defeated, he
pointed out. At present, according to
Dr. Bonn, one of the biggest problems
to be met is to meet this antagonism
of the bureaucrats towards parlia-
ment.

Small Parties Important

Another great difficulty which he
emphasized was the present division
of parties, whereby a small unit was
frequently able to swing an entire
election. The German system allows
a carrying over of votes from district
to district, each 60.000 votes meriting
a representative. This carrying over
prevents a gauging of the representa-
tion in Parliament, as it varies with
the interest displayed in politics at
different time.

In comparing the American system
of Government with that of Germany,
he said, “You don’t expect very much
from government and you needn't.

Music by Bill Hahn’s College Crew
will be the drawing card for the init-
ial football mixer of the season, to
be held at Reynolds club today after
the game. The affair will be spon-
sored by none other than Coach A.
A. Stagg.

The Reynolds club officials have
conceived the idea of opening both
reading rooms for dancing, thereby
relieving the congestion usually ex-
perienced because of the shortage
of dancing space.

Another new idea to be used today
is that of the club girls helping on
the refreshments. The girls of the
Pi Delta Phi club are to officiate in

the important matter of “eats.”
This is the third season for
rent mixers.

Mr. Nelson of the Reynolds
is quoted as saying that the real

stu-

club

pur-1

pose of the student mixers is that.

Things are admirably arranged
you by nature.”

Bureaucracy Necessary
The beaureaucracy, he claimed,

for

was

necessary in an old country like Ger-
many to carry out the duties of civil
life, but that here in America, it was

not needed. The acceptance of
new master, and the realization of
position were the two things to
accomplished by the bureaucrats.

“We must pass laws whether

its
its
be

can solve problems by passing them
<>r not,” he said. “Legislators can not
explain that there is no remedy to a
problem, they must produce laws to

make the people happy and to
them a sense of security in the
ernment.”

Dines At Quadrangle

at a dinner in the Quadrangle club.
This is the first guest that the Presi-
dent has undertaken to entertain since
recovering from his recertt illness.

PLAN FIVE RECITALS
TO PROVE INTEREST

IN CLASSICAL MUSIC

Io prove that interest in classical
music has not been and will not be
replaced by sentimental jazz, the South
Side Concert Course has arranged a
series of of five concerts at the Ma-
sonic Temple on Friday evenings be-
ginning October 15th. Braslau, Zim-
balist, Gogorza, Gradova, and Case are
artists secured for the courses this
fall.

I he course calls upon those inter-
ested in the cultural development of
the South Side and those xVho appre-
iate world atrists to aid in establish-
ing an institution in the community.
I o quote the letter, “We want you to
help us to get established because
we know you realize our value to this
community,—We want you to feel that
this is your course. We will welcome
suggestions, and if your support war-
rants our continuance, we will ask you
to name the artists you prefer to hear
from year to year. If you are not in
the habit of attending concerts, now
is a good time to begin.”

I he subscription for the entire
course is five dollars: tickets for in-
dividual concerts are two dollars each,

more than key his men for most of
the remaining battles. If anyone
can do it, he can, with his art. Ma-
roon fans are hoping for the best,
and realize the task that awaits “The
Old Man” in the remaining contests.

GOPHERS MEET
N. DAME TODAY

what they may expect from such a
dangerous opponent as Minnesota
whom they meet next Saturday. It
is no secret that Michigan has one
of the best teams in the country this
year.

Ohio State, whom the Maroons
face on October 30, plays Ohio Wes-
leyan at Columbus. The latter team
is considered stronger than Witten-
berg, whom the Buckeyes trounced
40-14 last week, but even so Coach
Wilce is not losing any sleep worry-
ing over the outcome.

In Kansas, the Wisconsin team is
meeting one of the weak sisters of
the Missouri Valley Conference, and
a Badger victory by a goodly margin
will not occasion any surprise among
the football intellegentsia.

North Dakota, who plays Iowa to-
day, was crushed by Minnesota last
week, 51-0, and Coach Ingwersen will
have an opportunity to experiment
some this afternoon.

“Pat” Pake’s Indiana team, which
is being totally ignored by Confer-
ence critics, plays Kentucky at
Bloomington today and the Hoosiers’
second victory of the season is doubt-
lessly forthcoming.

The first inkling of Who’s Who,
and What’s What in the Conference
situation will not be gleamed till next
week when the Illinois-Iowa, Michi-
gan - Minnesota, Northwestern - In-
diana and Purdue-Wisconsin games
will be disposed of.

69 Freshmen Out
For Maroon Staff

Thirty-two men and twenty-nine
women comprise the frosh editorial
staff of The Daily Maroon this year.
This exceeds all records of previous
years. Never before have the wearers
of the green taken such an active in-
terest in the school's daily newspaper.
The most difficult problem confront-
ing the staff proper, is not to find re-
porters but to find material with which
to keep them busy.

man on last year's frosh team. He
spent the summer as counselor at a
boys’ camp getting into condition.
Several Qther football luminaries
among them Captain Benny Freidman.
of Michigan, were at the same camp
throughout the summer.

Dear Turk:

I understand

down-

the following odds on
entrance the Maroons

will make today:

1—Doing a Charleston with clap-
ping of hands and the “hey-hey” fur-
nished by the Old Man .... 40-1.

2—Singing “Papa Loves Mama” . .

3—In white robes, clasping a Bible
in one hand and a football in the other

The highly touted Northwestern
eleven plays Carleton, a set-up, at
Evanston today, and a victory for
the small Minesota college will be
as unexpected as the correct time on
the clock outside Cobb hall.

Butler, coached by “Tony” Hinkle,
a Maroon luminary of a few years
back, should furnish Zuppke’s Illini
the needed practice preliminary to
the tough Iowa game the following
week. Next to Notre Dame, Butler
is the strongest team any Confer-
ence team will be called upon to meet
today.

Yost’s Wolverines far out-class the
Michigan Aggies and their game this
afternoon at Ann Arbor will hardly

tempts had anything but that, and
Florida’s secondary defense was weak.
With Captain Marks, fullback, and
Spence, regular end, on the sidelines
due to leg injuries Stagg will have to
use Leyers at full and Hoerger in
Spence’s place. Both Leyers and
Hoerger were initiated into conference
football when they played against
Florida Saturday. Marks and Spence
have been two of Stagg’s best defen-
sive players, and they will be missed.
Rouse will probably do the passing in
Marks’ absence.

The teams will be evenly matched
in beef and in experience. Four of
last year’s freshmen will start for
Maryland. They are Keenan. Croth-
ers. Wondrach and Kessler. Captain
Stevens is Maryland’s best in open
field running. Pugh, a substitute full-
back. ran wild against Washington and
will be sure to get into the game to-
day. Kessler, quarterback, does the
punting for the visitors.
