WHAT o/IT?

ffiCEORge MOggENSTERg

The Zeta Psi “Initiates’ Song” is,
I think, my favorite among the bal-
lads of the college frats. It is a
long, rambling affair in more or less
epic strain, to be sung soberly to
a tune whose range of notes is not
particularly wide. The song is a
good one to have about in case
there’s nothing to do of a lazy sum-
mer afternoon. The first verse has
to do with the founding of the frat,
and the connexion between the
founders and the present-day boys.
The second is all about “On Chat-
tanooga’s bloody field,” and the third
concerns itself with “And often in
my lit-tul home”, etc. Suffice it to
say that there’s lots of opportunity
for good close harmony in the chant.
And so, despite the fact that I am
not an initiated Zete, and only those
so classified are supposed to sing the
hymn. I sing it—and I even sing it in
company with one of the Zeta Psi
boys, who, if he were really true to
the mandates of his frat, would
strike me down as soon as the first
bar passed my lips.

* * ♦

All this, you see, leads up to th?
history of why frat pins are worn
and why they are worn. For, in the
second verse of the “Initiates’ Song”,
with the Zete left to die on the bat-
tleground, there comes that noble
passage:

“I saw a chief in Southern grey,
Decked with this badge march by.”
Now, obviously, the interpretation
one makes from this is that the chief
was wearing his badge, a la Sir
Baden Powell and his followers, upon
the outside of his coat. Indeed, my
friend has told me, confirmation of
this very point is contained in the
records of the fraternity at the
national headquarters. The badge
was not only worn on the outside of
the chief’s coat—it was worn on his
left lapel. That was the custom in
those days.

* * *

The outside of the coat was, as I
say, the first place where the fratern-
ity badges came to rest. At length,
some great mind asked first himself,
and then others, “Why not wear the
badge inside one’s coats, on one’s
vest, hid from the vulgar gaze of the
mob, who may mistake it for an Odd
Fellows pin?” Manifestly, there
was nothing to be said to this, so the
club boys took to wearing their
vests, and their badges on them. But
new difficulties came up. In the
earlier times, with the badge on the
coat lapel, the frat boys had easy
means of identifying themselves as
to affiliations, rating, and social
snobbery. But, with the symbols
tucked away from the light of day
inside dingy coats, it was a problem
to distinguish between the lowbrow
barbs and the club boys themselves.
This problem has continued through
the years. The most effective solu-
tion of it yet has been to wear the
badge close to one’s row of vest
buttons, and then to keep one’s hand
in one’s pocket perpetually.

*	*	*

But even this fails of entire sat-
isfaction. Lately again, I liear,
there has been a movement to wear
the pin on the lapel. Naturally
enough, this idea sprang up at
Northwestern, where the boys are es-
pecially jealous of their caste posi-
tion. At Harvard, however, where
certain organizations still exist sub
rosa, the boys are content to wear
their badges up almost to the tops
of their shoulders on their vests. And
at dear old Yale, with its intolerance
of snobbishness and its utter de-
mocracy, the eating-clubbers wear
their insignia on their union suits.
With all my inborn dislike of dis-
play clamoring approval, I commend
the example of the Harvard and Yale
boys to those of Northwestern. Frat
badges, I say, are better to be heard
and not seen, and it is better by
far that their light be hid under
figurative bushel baskets.

“It is important for purposes of

Dr. Lynn Harold Hough, former
president of Northwestern university

Dr. Owen Maintains That Modern
Youth Is Not As Bad As Painted

“Youth today is no worse than the
youth of fifty years ago,” said Dr.
Ralph W. Owen, director of religious
education in the Chicago Presbytery
at the meeting of the Westminister
club yesterday in Ida Noyes hall.

“In general, the young people of
the present generation can be divided
inot three classes. First come those
who are revolting against present
conditions and who are never satis-
fied with the state of affairs. Next
comes the indifferent class, and these

Charge Slenderness

Causes Tuberculosis

Protagonists of the Venus de
Milo figure scored again when an-
nouncement was made yesterday
that the slim figures now in vogue
are conducive to tuberculosis.

By taking the stand that flap-
pers, unwisely trying to attain
boyish figures, often need special
attention from tuberculosis work-
ers, the Chicago Tuberculosis In-
stitute through its superintendent,
Mrs. T heodore B. Sachs, yester-
day swelled the wave of opposi-
tion to the seventy-five pound
weight for young women.

The first ripple was set in mo-
tion last week by the statement
of Dr. Bruno Rosselli, Italian sa-
vant of Vassar college, who de-
clared that none of the women of
the future w ould be able to rival
the classic beauty if dieting re-
mained the fad. Lorado Taft sup-
po’jted Dr. Rosselli.

ACHOTH ENTERTAINS
ALL PLEDGES FRIDAY

Fraternity and club pledges will
be entertained at a tea dance to be
given by Achoth pledges Friday
from 4 to 6 in the theatre of Ida

both club and fraternity pledges.

Music for the occasion will be
provided by Carl Lillie’s orchestra

of the University, and Mrs. Rodney
Mott, wife of Professor Mott of the
Political Science department will act
as hostesses.

people constitute a large number of
the students on campus today. The
third group are those who really fig-
ure things out and who are trying
to see good in present affairs.”

Dr. Owen believes that young peo-
ple are more unmoral than immoral,
since they believe in following the
crowd. In his talk, he stated that the
(principal problems of youth were
those of conduct and morals, and in-
tellectual problems, as well as an en-
deavor to understand relationship
with others.

Miss Taft who is the daughter of
Lorado Taft, is a graduate of the
University and a member of Es-
oteric.

Graduate students and all persons
interested in voting have been invit-

Ponies No Longer
Scorned by Profs.

Professors are now advocating
the use of ponies!

Upsetting the popular belief of
students in regard to the con-
demnation of the use of ponies,
Professor Aaron J. Brumbaugh of
the Education department, , claims
that if used correctly, as a basis
for comparison with the student’s
own translation, ponies are of
more advantage than a study of
the vocabulary or dictionary. The
use of ponies for the purpose of
getting the literal meaning of
words conserves time and stimu-
lates the association of their
meaning at the same time. Be-
cause of the analysis involved in
the use of ponies, the results
should be beneficial to the student.
Many German schools use inter-
linears as a part of the regular
class work.

DISCOVERS LOST
ASIATIC DYNASTY

Locates Fifty-Five “Cities”
In Country of Ancient

Oriental Rulers

By Milton S. Mayer

Three thousand years of ashes and
dust have grudgingly revealed the
history of the Hittites—one time mas-
ters of western Asia—to H . H. Von
der Osten of the Oriental Institute
of the University, who recently re-
turned from a three months’ expedi-
tion in Asia Minor. Mr. Von der
Osten made public his dis-
coveries for the first time at a Uni-
versity lecture last night.

Where modern civilization knew
of only three lost settlements of the
ancient tribe of rulers, Mr. Von der
Osten found fifty-five buried or
ruined “cities” on his expedition and
countless nuggets of evidence that
shed a brilliant light on archaeology’s
hazy knowledge of the ancients.

Were Allies of Troy

“Contrary to the popular theory
that the Hittites sprung from Ar-
menia, documentary evidence that I
have gathered indicates southern
Russia as their original home. These
same Hittites were allied with Troy
in the Trojan wars of the Iliad, and
they themselves—anticipating the
Biblical story of ten centuries—
overthrew the turbulent dynasty of
Babylon.”

Mr. Von der Osten’s party, com-
posed of himself and his wife, cov-
ered three thousand miles of Asia
Minor, travelling in a Ford and liv-
ing for the most part on baked eggs,
sour milk, and melons. Except for
the occasional assistance of native

THE GREEN CAP EXAMS

GREEN CAP CANDIDATES were examined yesterday .concern-
ing their knowledge of the University, its history, its presidents,
its undergraduate activities and activity leaders, its customs and
traditions, in addition to special questons pertaning to the Freshman
society.

The examination was more than an examination, but it must
be called that in lieu of a stronger term. It was something that the
majority of upperclassmen would leap back in horror from, know-
ing that they could not possibly pass, were they to take it. Yet
Freshmen of only six weeks acquaintance with campus life are
expected to make exceptionally good grades in it, as it means the
sole means of entrance into what is to be from now on an honorary
society composed of forty men of the class of 1930.

The important thing about such a competitive exam is not that
it means that the Freshmen had to memorize a mass of facts, only
to forget them the day following the test. It means that a nucleus
of the entering class is well drilled in campus lore, they have been
tried, tested, and rung true. They have a lead on other freshmen,
they have become interested in campus life, and will naturally be-
come the future leaders.

Other universities and colleges have their organizations for
freshmen. Some band them together for forming special cheer-
ing sections for football games. Others are formed for hazing pur-
poses. But the Green Cap club stands by itself, a tribute to the
standards of the University of Chicago.

We welcome the Green Cap as an official society to the campus,
knowing that the members will carry on with the good work, not
only during the present scholastic year, but throughout their col-
lege careers.

“RUSS” PIERCE

YESTERDAY S DAILY MAROON carried the announcement of
the resignation of Russell Pierce as head of the University Bu-
reau of Public Relations. “Russ” Pierce, as he has been known
about campus during his recent undergraduate days, took over the
newly-founded Bureau which Henry Justin Smith, managing editor
of the Daily News, organized, and with remarkable ability continued
the work of presenting the University to the citizens of Chicago
and the nation.

The purpose of the Public Relations office is to enlarge the
sphere of usefulness of the University by carrying a knowledge of
its work for Chicago and humanity to the community. Advertis-
ing and notoriety have never been the aim of the school. But it
has wished to present its scientific research, its scholarship, and its
educational work to the widest possible audience. The public can-
not and does not read the scientific and scholarly journals which
carry to the academic world the achievements of the University.
But the public can learn of these things through the newspapers.
And that is where the Public Relations office enters. It interprets
the University of Chicago to the newspapers.	/

And Russ Pierce who adorned this very Maroon office as editor
not so long ago has built, on Mr. Smith’s foundations, a useful and
efficient structure in the University. In spite of his own remarks
on the general lowness of publicity men he can be proud of his
work. He has given the Publicity office an impetus and an organ-
ization. We regret that the University must lose his services. But
we wish him success in the new work which he will enter.

genius a rare opportunity to write
shows,” said Watrous. “Even those
playwrights who have already com-
pleted their script will have access to
his invaluable knowledge of the
stage.”

From every point of the campus
come reports of Blackfriars shows on
the road to completion. Graduates,
undergraduates, faculty members,
and interested persons are contribut-
ing manuscripts this year which
promise, according to Watrous, to
reach a high mark for number of

It was also cold on Stagg field last
night. But the regular varsity foot-
ball team was there in a body to
hear and execute the sage advice of
A. A. Stagg. The drill was devoted
Stagg had his men running through
almost wholly to signal practice,
a few new plays which are expected
to make it harder for Thistlewaite’s
Wildcats on Saturday.

Everyone Out

The entire squad was out for
practice with the single ex-
ception of Kyle Anderson, whose
knee is not right yet. Ken Rouse,
Stan Rouse and Weislow, who were
not in uniform Monday, reported and
jogged through the drill with the
rest of them. The team, barring un-
foreseen injuries this week, will be
intact when the cross-city trip to
Evanston is made.

The Maroons who have been tak-
ing it easy the last two evening are
scheduled to go through a strenuous
practice today. The freshman with
Mendenhall and Burgess attempting
to do some of Baker’s and Lewis’
tricks will buck the varsity tackles
and toss passes after the fashion of
the Purple. The line which previous
to the Illinois game has worked only
in spurts is at last coming to form.
It has learned a trick or two while
Grim, Marek, Wilcox and Daugherity
have been making merry, Weislow
and Spence gave good accounts of
themselves against Illinois.

Need Offense

The line must put up a wonderful
defensive battle Saturday if the Mr-
roons are to win, for the offense of
the Staggmen is sadly lacking. They
have failed to score in the last three
games.

The old Illini bad weather jinx
seems to have been completely rout-

Illinois administration recently
bought for their Memorial Stadium.
Both the Iowa and the Penn games
were played in the best of weather
and the Indians live in hopes that
their good luck will continue. The
only wet spots on the gridiron after
the recent rains have been in scat-

under the flaps of the sections, in
spite of the use of 100-pound holding
blocks.

The universities regulars are put-

mainly consisting of scrimmage
against the Frenchmen. The yearl-

purpose. Both Wabash, the Illini foe
for the 13th of November and Ohio
State, invaders of the memorial Sta-

particular color, and Zuppke figures
that it will be well to get his men

the South Chicago Y. M. C. A.

The Annual H*gh School Meets
are to be held at Bartlett Natatorium
again this year, the preliminaries to
be held on December 11th, the fin-

The Maroon Coach is to be the
starter for these meets again this
year. He has invited the high school
swimmers to visit the Bartlett Tank
and get instructions as to starting.

Several of the prep stars have ac-
cepted the invitation and are prac-
ticing daily for their big meet. Some
of them are football men, too, so they
have to do their swimming work at
night. They have been participating
in the water polo games which are
held at the Maroon Tank at that

ion that the latter game has it all
over football in regards to the inten-

‘‘Best Team in Years” Is
Same Old Story, But

A True One

By Tom Stephehson

It’s the same old story again this
year.

Northwestern is to meet Chicago
with the strongest Purple team in
years—that’s the story. That was
the story last year when little Bob
Curley turned the Wildcats back
north with a two-drop-kick to noth-
ing defeat. That was the story two
years ago when little Bob Curley
beat them with one drop kick. That
was the story, and the low scores
proved it to be a true one.

Trounce Boilermakers

Well, everybody knows how true
that story is this year. Walter Eck-
ersall, writing in the Tribune, tells
the world that it is so, and he should
know, because among other things he
refereed the Northwestern-Purdue
game last Saturday. The fighting
Boilermaker outfit which looked so
good against the Maroons was rout-
ed by “Moon” Baker and his men to

Badgers Install
Amplifiers For

Hawkeye Battle

The 42,000 spectators who will
crowd Camp Randall Stadium for
Wisconsin’s Homecoming Game with
Iowa Saturday, will be initiated into
a new and extremely modern an-
nouncing and scoring device. The two
new additions to the Badger equip-
ment are in the form of a huge time
clock, and an electric announcer that
may be heard from every point in
the stands.

To Announce Play*

By means of a dozen or more am-
plifiers, installed at one point in the
stadium, the announcer’s v oice is
magnified to such intensity that the
information he imparts is clearly
head by all. The ball carrier, tack-
ler, kicker or passer, will be called
and the more intricate plays ex-
plained. A men with officiated exper-
ience will assist in the explanation
of penalties.

George Levis, business manager,
announces along this same line that
he has secured an electric clock to
be placed on the score-board for the
Hawkeye-Badger battle.

for the I-M Cross Country Run yes-
terday but failed to dampen the ar-
dor of over two hundred energetic
harriers who plan to run today de-

is quoted as saying that no matter
how deep the snow, he expects nine-
ty-five per cent of the men registered i
ready to respond to the three-forty-
five gun which starts the race.

Direction* To Course

To get to the course go west on
57th Street into the park until a t
large field is reached. Flags mark j
the course and it is very easy to find.
Anyone who has not been examined
must see Dr. Molander on the field
before the race. The participants
may get numbers from the chief
clerk. The places in the lineup at the
start are to be determined by draw-
ing numbers before the race at the
time of checking in with the Chief
clerk. The time limit has been raised
to 24 minutes and this will enable
many more men to finish.
