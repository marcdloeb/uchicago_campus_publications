WHAT OF

Things are happening thick and last
down on the University of Indiana
campus. It all began when the editor
of the “Indiana Daily Student” was
seized with the idea that certain se-
cret organizations on the campus had
unutterably dabolical intentions, and
that the welfare of the university, the
state, and the Hoosier Society was be-
ing undermined whle everyone sat cas-
ually by. The organizations suspect-
ed by the editor of the “Daily Stu-
dent" were not regular fraternities.
They were rather organizations whose
personnel had been recruited from the
length and breadth of the Blooming-
ton Fraternity Row, and membership
in which was considered an honor by
those giving out bids to the organ-
izations in question.

Thngs began when an alumnus of
about the class of ’20 came out in the
"Daily Student” with the awful charge
that one of the societies, Sphinx Club,
had thrown a beer party back in the
dim, dark days when he was in school.
“My roommate, a member of Sphinx
Club," ran his indictment, “confessed
to me at the time that the total mem-
bership had gone out in the country
on the night in question, met at a
rendezvous and had had sandwiches
and several beers served them there."
This accusation was deemed strong
enough grounds to warrant the “Daily
Student” making the charge that the
Sphinx Society, and similar organiza-
tions, were “worthless, pernicious and
undemocratic.” The indictment of the
society as “undemocratic" probably was
the result of a rancorous feeling on the
part of the editor of the “Daily Stu-
dent” for any twenty men in a place
like Bloomington having wet goods of
any description and not passing out to
the rest of the town the name of the
Rainmaker who had supplied them.

In a few more days, the college pa-
per had printed the history of that
dreaded political organization, Theta
Nu Epsilon, and the sacred secrets of
Kappa Beta Phi—the significance of
the symbols, the motto, and about ev-
erything else—had also been exposed.
Like Sphinx Club, these other two
extra-Greek fraternities were held up
as a menace to the young. The
charges of “worthlessness, pernicious-
ness and undemocracy” were hurled
in turn at them. It was demanded that
the Sphinx Club white felt hats be
tossed in the furnace, and it and the
other organizations disband. An al-
leged member of Sphinx and Kappa
Beta charged dirty work in the elec-
tion of football captain. The editor of
the “Daily Student” claimed to have
been threatened by letter.

* * ♦ *

I he turmoil still continues in
Bloomington. It promises to get even
better. The secret societies have not
stood back and passively accepted the
charges hurled at them. Sphinx Club
the leader, printed a letter, signed by
its entire membership, in the paper a
couple days ago, denying that the
Baily Student” contributor was, as he
claimed, a member of the society. It
also, by way of retaliation, demanded
to know whether Phi Beta Kappa,
Skull and Crescent, Sigma Pi, or any
of the other honor fraternities of the
campus, were not also “worthless,” if
judged by the standards of the “Daily
Student.” Fellowship, the Sphinx men
said, was all that any organization
could foster in the line of worth-while
endeavor. And, the claim was made,
Sphinx Club had been successful in
this- It all is an awful muss. I hope
'to campus investigator here starts
Prodding around into the affairs of the
St. Mark’s Club or something.

ADD EXTRA TIME
AS TEAMS FALL
SHORT ON QUOTA

Settlement Drive Extended
Until Saturday,
Dec. 11

The Settlement finance drive has
been extended until Saturday, Dec. 11,
in order to give the teams an addition-
al week in which to raise their quota,

So far, money has been turned in
rather slowly, the amounts falling be-
low the standards of previous years. In
allowing the extra week. Holmes Boyn-
ton and Frances KerMall, the co-chair-
men of the Settlement drive, hope that
the teams will increase their efforts to
raise more money.

Van Pelt, Hagey Lead

Captains should keep in touch with
all the members of their respective
teams, and see to it that money is
turned in regularly at Cobb 206 be-
tween 12 and 12:15.

The teams of Herberta Van Pelt
and Harry Hagey are in the lead so
far. John Jackson’s and Helen Lam-
born’s teams have turned in next to
the largest amounts.

Treat Winners

Last year the best showing was made
by Holmes Boynton’s team which
turned in $586, and Mary Harvey’s
team which turned in $473. The lead-
ing teams this year are to be the
guests of the Settlement at a theater
party.

Florida Students

Prefer Period of

Study to Lecture

Students at Rollins College, Florida,
were impressed- by the idea of study
periods nstead of class lectures. The
usual sixty minute period has been
lengthened to two hours of supervised
study. The Professor in charge is
present for constant consultation with
the students. The purpose of the in-
novation is to place academic life on
a more practical basis. Class attend-
ance this rate is placed on a par with
the hours and duties of a business of-
fice.

“OUR LANGUAGE IS
DEGENERATING AS
LATIN, GREEK DID”

Degeneration of our language stares
us in the face, according to Prof. Roy
C. Flickinger, head of the University
of Iowa department of Latin and
Greek, who receved his Ph. B. here.
Latin degenerated into the modern Ro-
mance languages, and English, which
is said to be the most universally
spoken today, is apt to suffer the same
fate. British-English, 'American-Eng-
lish, Australian-English and South
African English might easily become
vastly different tongues, says the Iowa
educator.

Knowledge of the root meanings is
the best method of preventing this
catastrophy, he believes, and he rec-
ommends the study of Latin as the
best means of preventing the relapse
of English.

•Y* Plans To Hold

Open House Dec. 2

Another Y. M. C. A. open house
will be held Thursday, December 2, in
the South lounge of the Reynolds club
from 4 to 6.

A special invitation is extended to
the Methodists on campus to attend
the open house and get-together meet-
ing afterward. The Rev. Dr. Cox will
speak at the get-together.

Refreshments and entertainment
will be provided.

Urge Variety In
Themes by Using

Algebra Formula

"If I eat cake, and if I eat pie, and
if I get sick, perhaps I shall die,”
according to higher mathematics, can
be expressed in 5376 different ways.

M’. Robert W. Babcock, instructor
in the English department, maintains
that the sentence as it stands, accord-
ing to an algebraic formula, can be
arranged In twenty-four different ways.
Then, there is a choice of seven types
of adverbial clauses that one may use,
which increases the ways of expressing
this single sentence to 168. The possi-
bility of using substantive clauses, ad-
verbial clauses and phrases increases
the number eight times.

Consequently, there are 5376 differ-
ent ways of say ng one sentence and
at least a million chances for variety in
a term paper, Mr. Babcock asserts.

DR. F. SCHILLER
LECTURES HERE

Discusses William James
and Pragmatic Movement

Dr. F. C. S. Schiller of Oxford uni-
versity, England, who was closely as-
sociated with William James in the
beginning of the pragmatic movement,
will lecture tomorrow, at 4:30 in Har-
per M 11. His subject is “William
James and the Making of Pragmat-
ism.”

Dr. Schiller came to the United
States to attend the International Con-
gress of Philosophy at Harvard uni-
versity in September. He recently
completed a lecture tour on the Pa-
cific coast where he spoke at the Uni-
versity of Southern California, the
University of California and other
western colleges.

Board of Ed Uses

Axe On Georgie’s
Cherry Tree Tale

Cleveland children will no longer
think of George Washington as the
man who never told a lie for the Board
of Education in that city has decreed
that the famous “Cherry Tree” story
be excluded from the textbooks in
the public schools. The cherry tree
myth is not the only thing to be cen-
sored; it is only one of the many such
events commonly detailed in Ameri-
can History which have been classed
as “academic patter.”

FINAL Y. W. FROSH
TEA HELD TODAY

The last tea of the quarter for
Freshmen women given by the Cam-
pus Community committee of the Y.
W. C. A. will be held this afternoon
at 4 in the Y. W. room of Ida Noyes
hall. Miss Elsa Chapin, instructor

APPOINT JUDGES
FOR BLACKFRIAR
1927 SCENARIOS

Coleman, Nelson, Boynton
To Select Script
for Show

Blackfriar manuscripts for the 1927
production are to be judged this quar-
ter by three men who have served
many times in the past in the same ca-
pacity. The judges are Mr. Hamilton
Coleman, Prof. Bertram G. Nelsen,
and Prof. Percy Holmes Boynton, it
was announced yesterday by Phil Wa-
trous, Abbot of Blackfriars.

Eight manuscripts have been turned
in thus far. “The worst of these,” said
Mr. Coleman, “ranks with the best
work submitted during the past few
years. I am highly elated over the
1927 production as I believe the manu-
scripts are far superior to any that
have been written for some time.”

Get More Plots

‘More people have been working on
plots this year and the work is com-
ing in on time.” Today is the deadline
for all manuscripts.

Immediately after the selection of a
scenario, the authors of which will be
announced in the Christmas issue of
The Daily Maroon, work will begin
on tryouts and the selection of a cast.
The show will not be given until the
spring quarter, giving the staff ample
time for producing it.

Thirty-Six Years

Enough to Pedal
Earth Six Times

Riding a bicycle six times around
the world would take quite a while,
according to several eminent statis-
ticians.

As a Western Union messenger for
thirty-six years Mr. Gruter covered
a distance of 1,500,000 miles which is
equal to six times around the globe.
Mr. Gruter is quite a well known per-
sonage around the University campus
for he has worked this area, according'
to Mr. Gruter himself, since the time
that Coach Stagg pitched that never-
to-be-forgotten 18 to 1 baseball game
at Yale.

FETE SETTLEMENT
“KIDDIES” AT GALA

CHRISTMAS PARTY

Children from settlement districts
to which the University sends work-
ers, will be entertained at a Christmas
party Saturday, Dec. 12 from 2 to 5 in
the main gymnasium of Ida Noyes
hall. The Volunteer Service commit-
tee of Y. W. C. A., under the direc-
tion of Mona Flanders, is completing
plans to make the occasion a gala one
for the children. The program will
include various games, a story-telling
hour, refreshments, and gifts for every
child.

Pennies are being collected at the
door of the cafeteria of Ida Noyes hall
for the party expenses. All persons
who are willing to offer their cars
to bring the children to the Univer-
sity have been asked to notify Mona
Flanders.

Frosh Board Meets
Today In Classics 10

Daniel Autrey, chairman, has an-
nounced a meeting of the Freshman
Board of Management today at 4:30 in
Classics 10. The plans for the fresh-
man party which has been dated for
the evening of December 17 will be
the main topic for discussion at this
meeting. The Board of Management
is sponsoring this affair.

Stagg Speaks at
Football Banquet

Of Business Men

The Fourth Annual Football Ban-
quet, sponsored by the 55th Street
Business Mens’ Association, was held
last night at the Hotel Windermere at
7 o’clock.

The chief speaker of the evening
was Coach A. A. Stagg. He announc-
ed that he had just received a tele-
gram from the University of Okla-
homa accepting the invitation to play
the first game with Chicago, on Oct.
1, 1927.

Mr. Stagg also state that despite
the fact that the team was defeated
six times this season, it was one of
the best years Chicago has had be-
cause of loyal support given the team
by the students, alumni and friends.
The “Old Man” commended the Busi-

PHI PSI HOST TO
FINAL TEA DANCE

Ken Blake Plays Again

Friday Afternoon

A final boost toward the goal of the
Settlement drive will be given by the
Phi Psis at the third and final tea
dance Friday from 4 to 6 at their
chapter house on the corner of 56th
and Woodlawn.

Ken Blake, and his band will furnish
the music for the occasion. Refresh-
ments are also included on the pro-
gram.

Tickets are now on sale and may
be procured from Senior men or wom-
en for the customary twenty-five
cents. As this is the last opportunity
to aid the fund before the final
splurge Saturday, the committee head-
ed by Catherine Fitzgerald and Jack
Stambaugh, urges that all attend.

‘ins” And “Outs” of
Ida Noyes Topic Of

Federation Meeting

Ignorance of the many possibilities
of Ida Noyes hall accounts for the
general lack of interest shown towards
its use was the conclusion reached at
an open discussion meeting of Feder-
ation last night in Ida Noyes hall.

The women agreed that the appar-
ent indifference to the possibilities of
the building was due not to any lack
on the part of the adminstration, but
was probably caused by insufficient
publicity.

DICKERSON QUITS
SECRETARY POST
AFTER I3YEARS

Continues As Member Of
Beard; Also Edits

Record

J. Spencer Dickerson, who has
served as secretary of the Board of
trustees for more than thirteen years,
has resigned. He will continue as a
member of the board and will also hold
the position of editor of the Univer-
sity record, the official publication of
the University. His resignation was
received yesterday.

No Successor Named

Mr. Dickerson has acted as secre-
tary of the board of the Baptist The-
ological Union and has been with Rush
medical college in a similar capacity.
In addition to his work with these
organizations, he has had some edi-
torial experience, having been con-
nected with the Standard, the Baptist
paper which has represented that de-
nomination in this section of the coun-
try for more than half a century. He
has been a contributor to this periodi-
cal for the past thirty years.

As his successor has not yet been
named, it is expected that Mr. Dicker-
son will continue at his present post
until the new secretary is chosen.

Shakes Kept As
Roommates for
Wisconsin Frosh

“Go ahead and razz us,” say Wiscon-
sin men, “one thing, though, we have
a soft spot in our hearts for snakes.”

And sure enough they have. When
officials in charge of the dormitories
tried to deprive a frosh of his room-
mates, which consist of several rattle
snakes, a couple of boas, one or two
pythens and a daring little cobra; thir-
ty-two occupants of Adams Hall, in
which the snake admirer trains his pets
to stand on their heads, signed a pe-
tition to keep the crawlers.

And now as the curtain falls on the
last act, we see our yearling caressing
Mark Anthony, Peaches, Daddy
Browning and the rest of his repti-
lian comrades, who are still unaware
of the trouble they have caused.

CUSACK TELLS OF
MEETING OF HEADS
OF GREEK COUNCILS

Better co-operation between faculty
and undergraduate was the keynote of
the National Inter-fraternity Conven-
tion held at the Hotel Pennsylvania
in New York City November 27-28
according to James Cusack, Phi Psi,
who represented the University.

The delegates at the Convention
were the presidents of national frat-
ernities, deans of various colleges and
universities, and representatives of un-
dergraduate fraternities.

Scholarship and athletics were
stressed at the Convention. Dr. Wil-
liam Mather, president of George
Washington university, in a talk on
athletics said, “Too much stress is
placed on certain forms of athletics,
as football, today. It is much better
to engage in a sport which you can
carry all through life.”

COAL BILLS AND CIRCUSES

A COAL BILL incurred twenty-two years ago seems to be respon-
sible for the founding of a prominent, worthy, and substantial
campus activity: Settlement Night. One might call it a mere acci-
dent, a trivial effort to aid a University project with no dream of
the elaborate Circus which seems to be the final* culmination of the
coal bill.

It was this lowly fuel defecit and the more or less philanthropic
attitude of two undergraduates that set the ball rolling. That ball
has rolled long and steadily, splashing, it is true, through an occas-
ional mud puddle but appearing after twenty-two years quite ready
for another bounce.

The first Settlement affair was a dance in Bartlett gymnasium.
It was a success and the funds nicely wiped away the financial de-
fecit at the 46th Street and Gross Avenue haven. The whole idea
seemed thoroughly sound and worth while. It offered a philan-
thropic excuse for a campus party.

Thus the dances continued during the following years until
the undergraduates in charge of the affair, not satisfied with the
somewhat modest dance returns, evolved the idea of a Settlement
Drive. This was a novel idea. It “went over big” among the stu-
dents.

The activity outgrew the proportions of a mere dance. With
the added impetus that the Drive gave the leaders contrived the
“Settlement gala night” idea. Two years ago came “A Nite in the
North,” then “The Spanish Fiesta,” and now, driving the thing to a
climax, comes the Circus with promises of hilarity, celebration, and
a general field day. That is the evolution of Settlement night down
through twenty-two years.

Students are not wont to contribute to the Drive. Teams solicit
from Chicago citizens but the immediate undergraduate body is not
so keen about liberal response. The final night itself with booths,
dancing, and vodvil is about the only feature of the activity that
“goes home” to the student. But on that big night he is repaid
for his contribution, partly in a good time, and a great deal in the
satisfaction of having helped someone who sorely needed help.

APRIL FOOL

JJROM relaible sources it was learned today that one of the Uni-
versity of Chicago honor socities is planning to commemorate
the spot where President Max Mason turned over the first piece of
sod for the construction of the new Field ouse. It is the plan of the
society to brighten the spot with a beautiful Century plant so that
every hundred years or so a gorgeous blossom will hearken our
memories to the glorious occasion of April 1, 1925 when the solemn
rites occurred. It is also reported from the same source that the
newspaper pictures and accounts of the new Field House, printed in
the Chicago papers in 1925 A. D., will be encased in a metal box
and buried near the spot so that posterity shall be assured of an i
accurate record of the first great American fairy tale.

Third Orchestra Concert

By Pearl Bloomfield

The third Chicago Symphony Or-
chestra concert of the season was
presented yesterday afternoon in Man-
del hall. The program was particul-
arly gratifying in that it aptly followed
up the orchestra’s policy of presenting
new selections at each ' appearance.
Goldmark’s Symphony, number 1,
“The Country Wedding,” and two noc-
turnes by Debussy "Clouds” and “Fes-
tivals’ were exquisitely rendered.

An overture, “Patrie,” by Bizet,
opened the program. The number is
introduced by broad martial strains
which soon give rise to the sorrowful
theme of France’s misfortune of 1870.
Bizet attempted to call this composi-
tion the disaster of Poland, but it is
very French in quality. The warlike
attitude alternates with the plaintive
throughout the piece, with the note
of sadness maintained by the drums.
In the second movement the cellos and
violas take up the sorrowful tale, fol-
lowed by the violins’ poignant rendi-
tion. The climax is reached in the
last movement and the number closes
with a reverberating protest.

Goldmark’s “Country Wedding”

Goldmark’s “Country Wedding” was
perfectly rendered by the orchestra.
This composer is comparatively new
to most of us but the presentation of
this number created a desire for more
of his works. The symphony opens
with a wedding march developed in a
great many interesting variations. The
bass viols introduce the man theme and
the variations consist in changes in
rhythm, sudden shifts in key and in
varying moods. At times vivacious,
at times broad and sweeping, the
handling of the theme is marvellously
ingenious and shows masterful skill in
manipulation and inventiveness on ihe
part of the composer. The first move-
ment has a surprise ending in the rep-
etition by the bass viols of the original
theme, unchanged.

The scherzo movement is in the

form of a serenade, in which the use
of canon adds to the innate delicacy
and beauty of the piece. “In the Gar-
den,” the fourth movement, is played
by the stringed instruments and con-
tains an intricate and haunting melody
which is repeated in the last move-
ment—the dance. The whole sym-

taneity that make it a joy and de-
light.

Debussy was represented on the
program by two nocturnes, “Clouds”
and “Festivals,” and the sheer beauty
of the pieces was breath-catching. The
first selection reminds one forcibly of
a Cezanne painting in its pure im-
pressionism. The splashes of color,
the lack of sentimentality, combined
with the feeling of unreality and
vagueness lend Debussy’s compositions
an exquisite fascination. His new
techique consists in varied scales, new
developments in chords, an agglom-

Mr. Stock very graciously inserted
as an encore a “Polonaise” written by
Beethoven in his fifteenth year—a

charming little thing,—and concluded
the program with Dvorak's “Slavonic
Dance” in G Minor from his Opus
46. The afternoon was a great satis-
faction, musically, and the only regret
expressed was that the orchestra is not
with us more frequently.

If you are an athlete you have
been eating SHREDDED WHEAT
regularly at the training table.
If you’ve leaned more toward
the studious side you have
probably long since recognized
the energy-value of Shredded
Wheat to those of sedentary
habits. But, in either case,
don’t let down on that good
Shredded Wheat habit.

SHREDDED
WHEAT

provides all the BRAN, SALTS, PROTEINS,
CARBOHYDRATES and VITAMINS of
Nature’s good whole wheat in digestible
and palatable form. Its daily use will
stimulate the entire system, clear up the
complexion, and improve muscles and mind.

Shredded Wheat is
as appetizing as it is
nourishing. Two
biscuits make a real
meal—give strength
and energy for the
day, every day.

“Fritz” Crisler Is
Guest Of Honor

________At Home School

Herb “Fritz" Crisler was the guest
of honor at the annual banquet given
in honor of the Mendota High school
football team which was held last
Monday night in Mendota, III. He
spoke of the importance of fair-play
in all sports, and of clean sportsman-
ship meaning more than victories.

When Coach Crisler attended Men-
dota High there were no sports of any
kind played there and he had no op-
portunity to develop his natural ath-
letic talents.

He came to the University without
any training from prep-school athletics,
but even so proceeded to make an en-
viable reputation for himself. He
played baseball, basketball, and foot-
ball and completed his three years of
athletic competition with nine major
“C’s” to his credit.

SENIOR TEAM WINS
HOCKEY TOURNEY

Senior women's hockey team slid to
a 2 to 1 victory and into the cham-
pionship berth by defeating the Ju-
niors in the final game of this year’s
tournament series. Sophomores and
Freshman tied, 1 up, in the other
game played yesterday.

The muddy field transformed the
games into sliding meets. Polly Ames,
Junior captain, originated a new tech-
nique, that of slipping and sitting and
amazing proficiency in that line was
developed by every player. The girls
did not keep correct hockey positions,
neither technically nor in regard to
equilibrium, and they carried the mud
down the field more often than they
did the ball.

Ann Port, Freshman, and Nan
Griswold, Sophomore, vied for falling
honors, and Alice Wiles, Soph, and
May Friend, Freshman, for the sliding
championship.

The results of the interclass tourna-
ment are: Seniors first. Freshman sec-
ond, Sophomores third, and Juniors
fourth.

The D. U.’s took an easy game

Psi U ran loose on Kappa Nu, com-
ing out on the long end of a 48-0 score.
Lott started the game with a long run
and then passed to Elwood for the

ond pass from Lott. The Psi U's
brought the ball down the field and
Lott carried the ball five yards for
another touchdown. Watrous snared

Iowa U. Rectifies
Twenty Year Error

With 103 Letters

One hundred and three of the “way
back when” athletes in basketball,
baseball and track, have been declared
eligible to receive the major letter, at
the University of Iowa.

When Hawkeye athletics were in
their infancy, during the last years of
the nineteenth century and the first
years of the present era, few “I” sweat-
ers were awarded. The University
will rectify this error, on January 14
and 15, twenty-three years later, when
presentation ceremonies will feature
the dedication of the new field house.

Death has claimed ten former stars,
and forty-nine cannot be located be-
cause of faulty records. So invitations
will be extended to twenty-six base-
ball players, ten track athletes and
three cage players, to return to the uni-
versity for the belated recognition.

in action and the opening games are
near.

At the meeting of the conference
coaches which was held in Chicago
last week the following schedules
were held up:

the recommendation of Coach Mac-
Gillivray is followed.

Michigan asked for a tentative date
but if the situation depends on holding
Minnesota or Michigan. Minnesota will
be held because of the better trans-
portation facilities.

The University Rifle Club which
has been out of commission for the
past year, due to lack of financial sup-
port, has been recognized. The club
has one of the finest ranges in the
country.

The last of the semi-final touchball
games are to be played today. The
results will determine who will play
for the championship of the Univer-
sity in the final rounds.

—The Mad Poetess

THIS Daily Maroon is going to
embroil us in all sorts of difficulties
with our collegiate friends at North-
western. For example, from yester-
day’s issue we read an account of a
sociological experiment by the Evans-
ton school—“Purple Students Hosts
To Hoboes.” But why, we ask, did
they have to make the insinuation—
“Twenty-five studets acted as hosts at
this opportunity to study the hobo
among his kind?”

AT the College Inn they play all
sorts of school songs. We’ve heard
“Wave the Flag,” we’ve sneered at
“Oskey Wow-Wow,” we’ve hummed
the Notre Dame “Victory March,” and
have even bellowed convivially about
the Tulane Greenbacks Hitting That
Line. Never, however, never were we
so impressed with the injustice of
things as last Saturday night when
we watched many familiar faces cloud
mournfully as they noted the flagrant
neglect of their own Alma Mater. Lew-
is Institute must be accorded its due!
How about a song?

“Rootie de toot, rootie de toot.
We're the boys from the Institute—
Though we don’t pass
In every class

Gawd, it’s better n’ working!

Or maybe another anthem—

“Fight for old Lewis, never give in—

Ale, and high-balls

Whiskey and Gin.

Grade points and beer joints,
Cordiales and meads—

You hold the line, boys

IMPRESSIONS

It was an eight o’clock class at the
University of Chicago. The classroom
door opened softly from time to time
as another bleary eyed figure tiptoed
to his seat and settled down to rest.
Heads nodded in weary rythmn to the
lecture, pens moved mechanically to
the relentless flow of education. Sud-
denly the instructor’s voice snapped,
“Jones, what is your opinion on ques-
tion fifteen?”

“I don’t know,” sighed Jones.

“Smith, you answer the question.”

“I don’t know,” groaned Smith.

“Brown, Schwartz, Pinkoqwitx,
Humphwak.”

But don’t understand, gentle public,
this isn’t supposed to be funny. This,
yo usee, is an eight o’clock class at
the University of Chicago!

The Maroon sport page reports that
Bert McKinney and Dick Williams
had their tonisls removed at the same
time. That’s hard to swallow!
