In Grandeur

Rivaling the grandeur of the great
medieval cathedrals of Europe, which
required decades and even centuries of
time and untold sacrifices to complete,
the University chapel will soon rise to
its position of dominance on the Mid-
way. The cornerstone will be laid

FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE

this afternoon at 4:30 o’clock by
Jannes Hayden Tufts, former
president of the University.

For many months workmen

Prof,
vice-

have

been busy preparing the foundation,
which goes seventy feet down to bed
rock, in order to support the 205 foot
tower which will soar above the cam-
pus. This work is now complete, and
the contractors arc prepared to pro-
gress rapidly with the stone work after
the cornerstone has been layed.

Rivals Rheims Towers

Modern methods have made possible
the financing and construction of a
structure with all the magnificence
mass and beauty of the great Gothic
cathedrals of Europe, in a short span
of time, and without the sacrifices
which they required. This opportunity
has been taken advantage of in the
_ plans for the University chapel which,
perhaps, might best be termed a cathe-
dral.

Many of the European cathedrals
have pointed spires, making possible
approximately twice the height without
a difficult construction problem, while
the University chapel has a square-cut
tower. Yet the University tower com-
pares favorably in height with the
spires of the famous cathedrals . The
Rheims towers rise 263 feet above the
ground; the Canterbury tower is 230
feet high, the York tower is 200 feet,

Milton D. MacLean will take up
the duties of executive secretary of
the Y. M. C. A. on July 1. A grad-
uate of the University of Minnesota,
MacLean has been attending the Uni-
ve-sity throughout the year and dur-
ing this time has been closely con-
nected with the Y. M. C. A. and its
work.

MacLean is a student in the de-
partment of religious education and
has been doing special seminar and
research work in the organization of
university life. At the same time he
has been active in the Y. M. C. A.,
serving as a graduate advisor to the
cabinet, leading discussion groups in
fraternity houses, and assisting in

the direction of
cabinet..

The members
lected MacLean

the retreat of the

of the cabinet se-
to serve as execu-

tive secretary, and his name was ap-
proved by the Committee of Man-
agement. Taking up the secretary
post, he will have full charge of ar-
rangements for the Summer program.

Monroe Doctrine Meets Its Test

When America Tries Ruling Haiti

(Continued from yesterday’s issue)

By Paul H. Douglas

Since the President of Haiti is paid
$36,500 as a salary and for living ex-
penses, and is given in addition a
beautiful palace in which to live, it
will be easily understood that Hai-
tian presidents desire to stay in office
as long as possible. Since they can
change the members of the Council
at will, it would be expected that they
could always insure their own re-
election. President Dartiguenave,
however, was defeated in 1922 by the
Secretary of State, Louis Borno. It
is not denied in Port-au-Prince that
Mr. Borno was successful because he
bribed the councillors with larger
sums than Mr. Dartiguenave. Mr.
Borno was, however, successful in se-
curing his own re-election on April
12 of this year.

From what has been said, it will
have been inferred that while there
is a nominal Haitian government, the
real business of governing Haiti is
carried on by the American forces.
A regiment of marines is quartered
behind the presidential palace and
this fulfills the double function of
preventing the president from being
assassinated and of enabling the
American commander to make the
Haitian government follow his advice.
The finances of the country are con-
trolled by the American collector and
financial adviser and this official
draws up the budget and controls ex-
penditures. The gendarmerie, which

TEXT OF CHAUCER

Material necessary to the making
of a correct Chaucer text has been
gathered by Prof. John Matthews
Manly, head of the department of
English, during his six months
abroad. The text, according to
Prof. David H. Stevens, secretary of

Chaucer really wrote.

Prof. Manly has been working in
the British Museum and at the Pub-
lic Record Office in London on med-
iaeval literature, in general, and on
Chaucer in particular. Photostats—

NEW EXECUTIVES

Victoria Smith was chosen presi-
dent of the Art club for the coming,
year at the annual elections, held
yesterday. Stanley Neuman was
named vice president; Ann Van Nice,
secretary; and Siegfied Weng, treas-
urer.

The perpetuation of the club’s an-
nual exhibit in Ida Noyes hall is the
outstanding item in the plans for
next year. The enthusiastic recep-
tion accorded to the exhibit by the
public, marked it as unusually suc-
cessful, according to Isabelle Wil-
liams, outgoing president.

If you want a job with a big public
utility company you may not get it
if you are under twenty-one.

This statement came from the Uni-
versity Employment Bureau last
night. It seems that some students
have been applying for jobs with
some public utility companies lately
and have been refused because they
are not of age. These companies
have industrial insurance policies
which do not apply to persons under
age, and so they are unwilling to em-
ploy minors.

There are many companies in Chi-
cago limited by this rule, most of
them being public utility houses. Mr.
Jack Demeree, in charge of the Em-
ployment Bureau, wants this known
by the students so that they can ar-
range for other types of employment.

MANY tasks remain unfinished, as ’25-’26 draws to an end. There
is much to be done next year, if this business of making a better
University of Chicago is to go forward. Perhaps, in this last Ma-
roon of the year, we had better play the grandfather, and fold our
arms while the youth gather round, and give advice.

Students ought to know each other better. The walls between
the cliques are too high. To sophomore has much to learn from the
candidates for Ph. D.; and the medic can profit by a chat with the
law student.

> Students ought to study more keenly and with greater zest.
They ought to pry deeper than the mere surface of quizzes and read-
ing-reports. They ought to wonder, and inquire. To make them
wonder and inquire, ought to be the instructor’s first concern.

Better work ought to be done in the activities. The managers,
editors, and chairmen ought to think more often of the product, the
finished output, and less of the details of the machine.

Such improvements as these demand much work, and steady
attention. They demand close co-operation, and utter frankness.
They demand humility and tolerance.

But suppose the game becomes too hard; suppose the obstacles
are too great. Suppose you try, and are defeated. Well, no matter.
You hvae tried, anyhow.

College is a human institution. College life is no story-book. If
you find that all your comrades are not as frank and above-board
as you would have them be, if you find selfishness, inefficiency, big-
otry to hinder you do not call the thing a tragedy. College lige is
golden; but it is life, nevertheless. Accept college on these terms;
do the work that stands before you—or try it; and live.

As for us—we have finished. Goodbye.

Be kind to them!

When the old timers come back to the house and
bemoan their inability to find comfort and relaxa-
tion on the old fraternity bed—send them over to
the Windermere. They deserve a real night’s rest
after making the weary pilgrimage to Chicago and
undergoing the strain of having to act like under-
graduates again.

TAKE IT, AS HE LEAVES IT!

When I look back at four years of
so-called collegiate life, I have to
laugh and pity myself. Immersed in
the task of becoming a “big man on
campus,” what have I gotten out of
college?

I have learned what is was to have
power, and have found it sweet

I learned what it means to be in
the so-called public eye, and it has
gratified my vanity.

I have learned to preach, and found
out how few thoughts and how many
words are necessary to be “clever.”

I learned how to meet people; how
to act (to some extent); how to con-
duct myself; and what “rating” means.

I learned snobbishness.

I learned how easily politics are
managed.

And I learned some general facts to
be found in any text book, during
spare moments.

Add these up: total—college has
taught me dissolute habits and novel
ways of dissipation, yet it has not
taught me how to make money to pay
for them.

Tuesday, I’ll be signed, stamped and
sealed—a college graduate. My friends
will expect me to startle the world.
My enemies will expect me to make
an ass of myself. My folks will ex-
pect me to show some return on their
investment—and I: well I expect to
be just as big a fool, make just as
many mistakes, and do just about the
same things in the same way as al-
ways—only I’ll get gray, probably, or

consists of 2,400 men and which is a
combination of an army and a police
force, is also officered primarily by
American marines although there
are a number of Haitian lieutenants.
The Americans also control sanitation
and public works, but as I have said,
do not control education or the courts.
Since they do not control education,
they have been very reluctant to grant
money for it and no more has been
given out than that which the Haitions
provided prior to the American occu-
pation. The salaries of teachers are
low, averaging about $6 a month in
the country districts.

Before any act can be presented to
the Council of State, it must first be
submitted to the American comman-
der for his approval. If he approves,
it may then be passed by the Council
of State, but if he disapproves, there
is little possibility of its being en-
acted. The Americans are therefore
virtually in complete control of the
country. Even should the courts is*
sue orders compelling the occupation
to take certain steps, they would be
powerless to make their rulings ef-
fective since the germanderie is con-
trolled by the Americans and it would
refuse to enforce the orders of the
courts against the Americans.

Our Commission, was very happy
to find that there are not many com-
plaints at present concerning the bru-
tality of the American marines. There
seems to be little question that many
brutalities were committed from 1917
to >920 when roads were being con-
structed through the mountains. These
however have virtually stopped by
now and the American commander
seems to have his troops well in hand.
The Americans have moreover made at
least four important contributions to
the life of the Haitians; namely, (1)
in building roads, (2) in maintaining
peace, (3) in collecting customs hon-
estly, and (4) in improving the health
of the Haitian people. Save for an
uprising in 1919, there have been no
revolutions in the last ten years. The
gendarmerie land the marines have
given a certain kind of peace to
Haiti and have broken up the bands
of political bandits who were former-
ly numerous in the northern part of
the country. The fear which the
peasant formerly had of heing im-
pressed either into the military serv-
ice of the government of the revolu-
tionaries has, therefore, been removed.
The reduction in the military forces
has turned productive energies towards
agriculture and has made men less
afraid of pillage.

The Americans have also connected
the main cities and towns of the coun-
try by a system of highways. Such
roads were almost totally absent under
the Haitian regime. During the dry
seasons, it is now possible to go from
one town to another by automobile.
This system of roads at once makes
it easier to put down revolutions and
facilities trade and commerce.

The Americans are also collecting
funds honestly and are checking the
pettv graft of the Haitian officials.
This has enabled the occupation to
spend more money for public works
and for saaitation than was formerly
expended by the Haitians even though
the avenues are not greatly larger
than they were before the American
occupation.

The most important contribution of
all, however, is the work which the
Americans have done to improve the
health of the people. The physical con-
dition of the Haitian people at the
present time is extremly deplorable.
It is estimated that three-fourths of
the population is afflicted with syphilis
and that approximately an equal per-
centage have hookworm or ringworm.

In the coastal regions, two-thirds
have malaria while tuberculosis per-
meates the vast majority of the pop-

ulation. The country is poverty
stricken and the average annual in-
come is only $20 a year. Even though
bananas sell for only two cents a doz-
en and oranges at an equal sum, it
will be seen that this figure is insuf-
ficient to buy the flour, meat, sugar,
milk, etc., that are needed to secure a
balanced diet and to maintain health.
To meet this situation, the Americans
have established eight hospitals which
are efficiently managed and give ex-
cellent service. There are some forty-
three clinics and approximately 400,000
free treatments are given each year.
More money should unquestionably be
spent on sanitation but a most prom-
ising beginning has been made.

In brief, the history of our occupa-
tion of Haiti is a mixed one and both
good and evil intermingled. We have
used unscrupulous tactics to secure
control of the country. We have pro-
tected the interests of America in-
vestors in the Haitian railroad at the
expense of the Haitian peasant, but
we have given them material advan-
tages. Whether these are sufficient
to justify our further intervention is
a question which one has to decide in
the light of one’s philosophy. I per-
sonally think it a dangerous precedent
for one country to appoint itself the
policeman or the guardian of another
since no one is qualified to act as

judge in any case in which he is per-
sonally (involved Yet the United
States by its interpretation of the
Monroe Doctrine prevents any interna-
tional intervention in Haiti and re-
serves to itself the right to decide fcr
itself what control it shall exercise over
the countris of the Caribbean and of
Central America.

I believe that the future policy of
the Unitd States towards Haiti should
consist of at least the following steps:
(1) That, we will not seek a renewal
of the treaty, and terminate the oc-
cupation of 1936. (2) That during the
intervening ten years we shall try to
prepare the Haitians for self-govern-
ment as rapidly as possible. (3) That
in pursuance of this end, we shall call
for the election of a Haitian congress
in 1928 in order that the Haitians may
acquire the habit of democratic delib-
erations. (4) That an increasing num-
ber of Haitians be promoted in the
gendarmerie, in the public works de-
partment and in. the health department
in order that they may be competent
to manage the lines of activity when
the Americans withdraw. (5) That the
force of marines quartered in the is-
land be reduced from a regiment to
at most a battalion and preferably to
two companies and that the present
military commander be replaced by
a civilian. This last recommendation

is not made as a reflection upon the
present .High Commissioner, General
Russell, but because of the better re-

Golfers from six Big Ten schools
tee off this morning for the first day’s
play of the year’s most important meet-
the Conference Championship Tourna-
ment. They will play thirty-six holes
today and a like number tomorrow,
medal play. The Tourney is being
held at the sporty Knollwood Country
Club at Lake Forest. Illinois.

Play Practice Round

Most of the teams played practice
rounds yesterday afternoon tn learn the
course and get limbered up for today’s
long grind. A gruelling battle is pre-
dicted for the titles, both individual
and team play. Chicago, Northwestern
and Michigan are the favored four-
somes, but al! teams are conceded a
good chance for the honors. ’

Patterson, Hisert, Bartlett and Dor-
sey spent a day in practice yesterday,
and all turned i t cards around 80. Par
the course is 73. If this fourssome is
hitting them true to form today and
tomorrow, Chicago should cop team
honors. In the dual meets, the Ma-
roons overwhelmed every opponent,
and these victories include all teams
entered in the tournament except
Northwestern.

A dual match scheduled with the
Wildcats was called off because of bad
weather conditions. It was to be the
feature match of the season as North-
western is hailed by many as the best
team in the Big Ten, having their last
year’s title winners back this year.
Heppes, )Larson, Miller, and Stearns
will represent the Purple. They have
lost one match during the season.
Michigan the other favorite, is repre-
sented by Feely, Clover, Cole and Con-
nor. .

WESLEYAN CAPTAINS
NAMED AFTER SEASON

Captains of Ohio Wesleyan athletic
teams will no longer be elected as of
yore. They are to be elected at the
close of each season and by the teams
but only as honorary positions holders.
This measure has been ruled by the
Ohio Wesleyan athletic board, which
also states that the acting captain will
be appointed by the coaches from game
to game.

The purpose of this new ruling is to
keep anything of a political character
from entering into the selection of the
leaders. It is thought that the system
will keep all athletes working with
every ounce of strength until the final
whistle peals at the end of each game.
This will keep the men straining until
the last game of their college career



Burke and Williams
Tie In Frosh Meet

Chicago’s two sensational Frosh
distance men. Wakefield Burke and
Dick Williams, are pretty evenly
matched. These two yearling track
stars have been fighting it out be-
tween themselves in the mile and
two-mile runs all year, and during
the last week, in connection with
the Freshman “All-Around,” they
went into it on a larger scale. Each
ran five events, the mile, half-mile,
quarter-mile, 220 yd„ and two-mile,
and even then could not break the
close rivalryship. Burke won' the
220 and mile, Williams the two-mile
and half-mile, while they ran a dead
heat in the quarter. All of the
tares were exceedingly close. So
they tied for first honors in this
meet, the fast of the Frosh season,
and will have to carry over their
battle next year when they will be
running for the Maroon.

Delta Sig Wins
J-M Total Point

Shield For 1926

Delta Sigma Phi, by turning out
strong for all Intramural sports, finish-
ing well up near the top in most of them
and winning several of them, has again
won the high point honors for the en-
tire year. Last year they barely won
the beautiful total-point shield by scor-
ning 449 1-2 points. This year they gar-
nered 527 1-2 points to just win over
Kappa Sigma (520 points) and annex
this year’s shield, the most handsome
of all the brilliant I-M awards.

Sigma Nu Third

Sigma Nu, with 459 1-2 points placed
third in the entire year’s scoring, while
Phi Kappa Sigma placed fourth with
438 1-2 points. Midway Athletic Club,
non-Greek champions dropped from
their second place of last year to fifth
this year, getting 433 1-2 points.

Phi Kappa Psi also dropped down a
few places, from third, last year to sixth
this year. The Phi Psi’s garnered a
grand total of 392 1-2 points. Phi Gam-
ma Delta came in seventh with 367 1-2
which was 1-2 point higher than the
Alpha Delt total, winner of eighth
place. Tau Defa Phi took ninth place
with a total of 345, and Delta Chi plac-
ed tenth with 340 1-2.

Grand Total High

The grand total for the entire first
ten places is 550 higher than last year,
despite the fact that handball, foul-
shooting, and the ice carnival events
did not yield participation points this
year. This is evidence of the growing
interest in Intramurals at the Univer-
sity, as well as an increase in the num-
ber of sports, and more general par-
ticipation in each sport.

Over a thousand men have taken
part in this year’s program. If dupli-
cations were counted for the various
sports the number of individual con-
testants would run well over five thou-
sand. According o John Howe, newly
elected I-M head, this “bigger and bet-
ter” movement, which has character-
ized the very successful year has only
began to grip the Intramural depart-
ment, and “through extensive research,
now being carried on by Doc Moland-
er, who is investigating the different
methods employed among all colleges
of the country, we expect to find new
ways of increasing interest and better-
ing the department next year. We par-
ticularly hope to develop the noti-
fraternity, graduate, and faculty com-
petition of the local campus.”

A comparison of the points which the
leading teams have scored this year
with their totals for last year, show
this rise in general) participation. Kap-
pa Sigma rose from 1221-2 to 520
points, Sigma Nu from 290 to 459 1-2,
Phi Kappa Sigma from 339 1-2 to
4381-2, Alpha Delta Phi from 242 1-2
to 367, Delta Chi from 171 1-4 to
340 1-2.

wet spells has been ordered and it will
help to keep the ground in good con-
dition in any kind of weather. No
longer the fear of not being able to
distinguish the players; their shiny,
new uniforms will be kept immacul-
ately clean, throughout the struggles,
unless—rain should interfere during
the contest.

The benches and seats of the sta-
dium will be painted this summer so as
to have them in good condition for
the fall use. What’s more a polo field

Wins 6-0, 6-1, 6-1, From
Independent I-M

This important battle marked the
close of a grand and glorious season, in
which over two hundred players par-
ticipated in the singles division alone.
This same victor also shared first hon-
ors in the doubles competition, which
he and Bob Fisher, representatives of
Beta Theta Pi won from the Zeta
Betes in a close finals match Wednes-
day afternoon.

Place had been picked before yester-
day’s match to annex the Universiity
title, and he ran absolutely true to
form. He went through the entire
tourney in easy style, head and shoul-
ders above his contestants, and was
never hi danger of elimination, in spite
of the extraordinary competition this
year and the long grind to the finals.

Wins Easily

He defeated Whitney, Roque, Reich,
Weiss, and Hack in his rise to the final
round, having little trouble with any
of these strong contenders, while
Hoppe was forced to his limit in the final
matches, which included Clark, Junker,
Gaskill, DeBois and Bohns.

STAGG CALLS FOR
HUGE ATTENDANCE
AT NATIONAL MEET

In the following letter, written by
Coach A. A. Stagg, and .appearing in
yesterday's Chicago Tribune, the Old
Man tells of the necessity of attendance
at the National IntercollegiateTrack
and Field Meet, and calls attention to
the fact that Chicago is in danger of
losing the great meet:
TO ALL SPORTSMEN:

The fifth annual meet of the National
Collegiate Athletic association will take
place on Soldiers’ field next Saturday.
Will you be one of ten thousand to
support this meet and thereby help
keep U annually in Chicago? If so. act
quickly by byuing tickets at A. G.
Spalding & Bros., 211 South State
Street. The meet means a lot of hard
work for the committee, and of course
without financial reward, but person-
ally I hate to see Chicago lose it. One
city already has guaranteed $10,000 to
have the meet next year.

The N. C. A. A. meet was first held
in Chicago and has never been held

Grads Hold Varsity
Last Inning

cide the Annual Alumni-Varsity Base-
ball game, held at the Norgrenite Field
yesterday afternoon as a fore-runner to
the “C” Banquet in the evening.

Claude Brignail, varsity heavy-hitter,
broke a 2 to 2 deadlock in the final inn-
ing, when he brought in two scores
with a healthy swat and later romped
in himself to bring the score to 5 to 2.

Joie Gubbins hurled seven innings for
the varsity. Wallie Marks replacing
him near the end. while Paige, the
Alumni pitcher, went the full route.
Both nines played air-tight ball, which
kept the score down until Briggie’s
three-bagger turned the trick.

Norgren, Crisler and Molander of
.the Maroon athletic department helped
keep the ball a rolling for the Alum-
nians. Norgie played at Centerfield,
Fritz at short and Doc in right field.
Weiss and “Red” Cunningham, last
year’s captain, gave their former team-
mates plenty to do, while McGuire and
Lynch brought up the remainder of
Paige’s support. Jack McDonough,
varsity man, served as catcher for the
graduates.

The regular Maroon line-up filled the
varsity positions. Capt. Gubbins and
Webster formed the batteries. Price
played first, Kyle Anderson, at second.
Capt.-Elect McConnell at short, Brig-
nail at third, with Marks, Zimmerman,
and Gordon in the outfield.

SEVENTEEN MEN

GIVEN T HONOR

Five Major Letters and
Twelve Minor Letters
Presented

The long awaited final “C” awards
have at last been announced and the
anxious athletes and their friends have
but to glance at the list below to see
if the team-men are to be numbered
among the ranks of the “C” men. The
awarding of the letters is always, be-
cause of its-honorary nature one of
the big features of the quarter and the
announcements at the end of this quar-
ter have been looked forward to for a
long time.

Major Sport Letters

Of the major sports the baseball and
tennis final lists were given out. An-
nouncements of the track and fencing
numeral awards were also given out.
Five major letters, seven old English
letters and five old English team letters
were included.

John Kyle Anderson, Claude L. Brig-
nail, Joseph Eugene Gubbins, William
Randolph Macklind and James Ran-
dolph Webster received the major
baseball honors. All have played stel-
lar though consistent baseball through-
out the year. Webster has been the
Maroon catcher in almost every game
this year and has certainly proved his
worth behind the bat. Gubbins has
been the mainstay moundsman of the
squad and the heavy work in the ma-
jority of the games rested upon his
shoulders. The rest of the men have
all worked hard for the success of the
team. •

Old English Letters

Old English letters were received by
/Albert W. Gordon. Roy A. Price, and
■Charles W. Hoerger, while Max Lurie,
John McDonough and Theodore O.
Zimmerman were given the old Eng-
lish with B. T. markings. These men
have all worked hard in their practice
and the games but almost all are junior
college students and have several more
years to play.

In tennis the awards went to Capt.
Walter Shaeffer, Parker Hall. Herman
Shapinsky, and Richard Hudlin; they
all were the recipients of the old Eng-
lish sweaters. Wendell Bennett and
Thorpe Drain also received the same
sweaters with T. T. on the sides. The
tennis team has had a very successful
but not a championship season.

Track numerals of the highest class
with the heavy sweaters were on by
Wakefield Burke, R. Frey, W. Jackson,
Warren Klein, Paul Reitan and Rich-
,ard Williams. Regular 1929 numerals
went to Harry Ault, W. McDonough,
Wilkins and Hathaway. The season
has been an unusually fine one for the

This tournament, under the manage-
ment of Dan Hoffer, coach of the title-
winning gym team, will decide numer-
al winners in the net sport. Sixteen
men,' the cream of the Intramural
tournament and Physical Culture Class
tournament, were selected and paired
off. They were Place, Powell, Hipsh,
Harmon, Bennett, Roterus, Hebert,
Abbot, Whitney, Fisher, Reich, Lesser,
Keefer, Sisson, Erickson and Clark.
Bob Place and Bob Fisher, doubles
champion were conceeded the best
chance to go through to the final round
but were forced to forfeit their matches
in order to play the doubles finals in
the I-M tourney.

Numerals are awarded to the winner
and runner-up in the meet. Clark is
picked to eliminate Whiteney, but a
cloje match is expected.

One whoexecutes and delivers
a life insurance policy. In
other words, a person whose
business it is to offer the
known benefits of life insur-
ance to individuals, to corpor-
ations, to partnerships, etc.

But further, the life under-
writer is one who must con-
vince those clients of the
benefits offered. This means
stimulating contact with hu-
man character, and with large
affairs. Some underwriters
prefer the game of character
and deal mainly with indi-
viduals. Others prefer affairs;
to them is open the great field
of business insurance.

Furthermore, the business of
life underwriting pays highly
for initiative and ability.

And still more, the life under-
writer offers to his client a
commodity which has no risk
in it, does not deteriorate, and
adds no burden of mental
worry. The life underwriter
sells absolute security, the
foundation of serenity of mind.

It is worth while to think
these things over now and to
remember them when, per-
haps, you find yourself wrong-
ly placed in whatever business
you may have chosen.
