Wallie Watch Out” is the title

of

the annual Blackfriars production.

The name of the play written by
Walker Davis and William Bagei
was divulged last night at a meeting
of the Board of Superiors. The per-
formance will be in Mandel hall May
14, 15, 21, and 22, under the direc-
tion of Hamilton Coleman.

Try-outs Successful

The first try-outs, held last night
in Reynolds theatre, were pronounced
unusually successful by Paul Cullom.
Abbot of Blackfriars. Beside several
stars from last year’s production,
“Kaiti from Haiti,” a member of new
dramatic aspirants, some of whom
have appeared in other plays this
year, are seeking places in the cast.
Among the last year’s players out
last night were Clyde Keutzer, Don
McGinnis, Seward Covert, and* Archie
Trebow.

‘Wallie Watch-Out,” says Cullom,
“is a play of exceptional promise for
varietd types of acting, affording
splendid opportunities to those who
have not previously been in campus
productions.”

Call Chorus Thursday

While definite selections will not
be made for several days, Mr. Cole-
man states that there is ample dra-
matic material for the play. Try-outs
for the choruses will be Thursday
afternoon at three o’clock in the Rey-
nolds theatre. As the choruses will re-
quire an unusually large number, ex-

Fraternities, after being outlawed
in the State of Mississippi for four-
teen years, are again allowed to es-
tablish chapters at the University of
Mississippi. Sponsors of the hill have
attempted to pass it at every session
of the legislature since 1912, when
the prohibitory measure was enacted.

Representative Wynn, speaking for
the fraternities, said “Fraternities
are wholesome. They promote schol-
arship and fellowship.” He denied
the charge that fraternities were for
rich men. As evidence he offered his
personal experience, stating that he,
a fraternity man worked his way
through college as a waiter in a res-
taurant.

Representative Wise, a non-frater-
measure, declaring that harmony
nity man, also spoke in behalf of the
reigned at the university until Gov-
ernor Russell took up the fight
against fraternities. He said three of

SPANISH LITERATURE
AUTHORITY TALKS AT
CLUB MEETING TODAY

Mr. Ralph Keniston, one of the
greatest contemporary authorities on
Spanish literature in this country, will
give a speech at the meeting of El
Circulo Espanol today at 4:30, in Ida
Noyes hall. The club will also hold a
general reception for all freshman and

students who have not attended
previous meetings.

“In keeping with the special
grom adopted for this week, the

any

pro-
club

has been able to secure Mr. Ralph
Keniston, whose talk will interest those
taking Spanish work. Also in order
to make the meeting more gala re-
freshments in keeping with the Span-
ish colors and taste will be served,"
said Yolanda Simez, president of the
club.

Arrangements have been made so
that everyone will have an opportunity
of meeting all those present. It is
urged that as many students as pos-
sible be present.

In appreciation of the services of
Prof. Ernest Hatch Wilkins as dean
of the colleges of Arts, Literature
and Science, the Undergraduate
council has invited eighty prominent
students to a dinner given in Dr. Wil-
kins’ honor, Wednesday, April 14, at ■
7, in the sun parlor of Ida Noyes ।
hall.

Announce Chairmen

Lucy Lamon and Allen Miller, will
act as chairmen of the dinner. In
order to keep it a strictly student
affair, inivtations have not been ex-
tended to members of the faculty,
with the exception of the president
and vice-president of the University.

“This dinner,” said Miller, “is be-
ing given in honor of Dr. Wilkins,
on his retirement from the office of
dean. He has instituted many move-
ments in the University administra-
tion, and these have vitally improved
the undergraduate student life and
activity.”

Students to whom invitations have
been sent to attend the dinner are
asked to reply at once, sending their
answers to the Undergraduate coun-
cil, to Miss Lamon, or to Miller. Noti-
fication of acceptance or refusal
must be in the hands of the council
by Friday, it was announced.

Practical Studies

Progress of the big subscription,
drive The Daily Maroon is staging I
this week will be checked up on at a ।
luncheon to be served this noon in j
the sunparlor of Ida Noyes hall to i
the four competing teams, every one
of which is to report. Details of the
theatre party which is to be the re-
ward of the winners will be announc-
ed by Thomas Mulroy, business man-
ager of the Maroon, while Frank
O’Hara, director of undergraduate
activities, will speak.

Said Mulroy yesterday: “So far
the subscription drive has been much
present rate is maintained all week,
better than that of last year. If the
the results ought to be quite satis-
factory.”

Twenty women will be on hand af-
ter junior chapel today to sell sub-
scriptions, while a table will be placed
at the foot of the stairs in Cobb hall
at which subscriptions may be obtain-
ed. Mulroy will speak in chapel to-
day on the general purpose of Ma-
roon week.

The captains of the teams, Kath-
erine Rose, Betsy Farwell, Helen
Lamborn, and Ruth DeWitte, all have
hopes of winning the competition. As
yet no team is definitely out of the
running.

The Maroon’s first literary supple-
ment which was due to be published
today was unavoidably delayed by
overwork. It will appear with the
regular edition of the Maroon tomor-
row morning. Hereafter, it will be
published regularly every two weeks

I during the quarter unless student
opinion seems to be definitely against
it. Material for future editions has

I already been partially prepared, so
, that the work of putting out the sup-

Agriculture, the study of labor | plenient win not be too hard.

problems, and sociology form the ba-‘
sis of the curriculum in the schools
of Soviet Russia, according to Dr.
Lloyd Storr-Best in his lecture on
“Education in Soviet Russia” given
yesterday in Harper Assembly room.
History, geography, science and writ-
ing as such are not formally taught,
but only as incidental to the particu-
lar problem on which the class is
working. All education is of a prac-;
tical nature, much work being done i
outdoors.

In addition to practibility, Soviet ।
education emphasizes atheism and
communism, says Dr. Storr-Best. The
success of communism and marxism
depends upon the education of the
coming generation, since in many lo- j
calities the peasantry offer consider-
able opposition to innovations, he <
continues. It is, however, the dream
of Russia, to become eventually the
most cultured nation of the world.

FAMOUS BAND

SUPPLY MUSIC

Congress Orchestra Leaves
For South Shore

. April 23

By George Morgenstern

The Coon-Sanders Original Night-
hawk orchestra, recently playing at
the Balloon Room of the Congress,
will dish out the usual assorted blahs
and oom-pahs at the Military Ball at
the South Shore Country Club April
23. That statement, on second
thought, is erroneous; for nothing
Bros. Coon and Sanders ever per-
petrate is “usual.”

The Nighthawks, indeed, are en-
tirely individualists. They may be
eccentric, but they’re effective. Hugh
Wilson, leader of the ball, has whisp-
ered the word around the battlements
for all good men coming to the dance
to hush it up who’s furnishing the
music. He’s afraid careful mothers
may keep their daughters home if
they hear Messrs. Coon and Sanders
and company will be straining the
strains at the ball.

Have Wide Reputation

That’s the sort of reputation the
Nighthawks have. They started off
originally in Kansas City, where they
attained something a good deal more
widespread than local notoriety by
playing typical Coon-Sanderish mus-
ic over the radio at a time of night
when all good folks are in bed. The
Nighthawks, indeed, were so mean
that the feeling went around that
such a comparative center of yoke-
Iry as Kansas City was no place for
them, and they were accordingly
summoned to Chicago, where they
have played at the Lincoln Tavern
and the Congress ever since.

Play Twenty-six Instruments

Eight men besides the two chiefs-
of-staff function in the Nighthawk
ensemble. The gang will come armed
to the South Shore with twenty-six
instruments, according to the rumor
that is being bruited about. This
indicates a wide range of versatility,
or something. The Military Ball en-
gagement will mark the first time
that the Nighthawks have gone off
the home grounds to get feverish.

tell something of. her work of research
in the chemistry of vitamin A, in which
field she has done her principal work
and made contributions to scientific
knowledge. For some years she has
spent much of her time in investigating
problems connected with this phase of
science, and has accomplished a great
deal. Everyone interested in this sub-

attend Dr. Coward’s lecture.

Polo was made a minor sport for
University students through a deci-

ference held recently. Qualified team
members will receive “C”s” for excel-
lence in this new form of intercollegi-

for skill in horsmanship, in handling
the stick, and in cooperating with
other members of the team.

Polo is recognized as a minor sport
at Harvard. Yale, Princeton, and other
eastern colleges. Chicago is the first
mid-western university to include it
in its sport curriculum. Indoor games
with some of the eastern teams will
form a part of the program of the
team in the future, although arrange-
ments will not be made for competi-
tions this year. The team will com-
pete with other mounted senior units
of the R. O. T. C.

It is claimed by the sages who gov-
ern the sciences of seasons, weather,
et al, that Spring has now been or-
dained as governor of this sphere.
Thus far, it has done much in its offi-
cial capacity to plan the life of its
sphere, indeed, it has already issued
the writ for a crowded and gay cal-
endar. It does not give much en-
couragement to the hostesses of garden
parties, to the usual group of Spring
picnickers, nor to the haunters of
Sleepy Hollow.

The first signs of Spring, however,
that people argue about may be many
and various but there is none so true
in its significance as the occurrence of
a Spring prom. Surely that is evi-
dence enough that Spring is an ac-
tuality.

gram includes two plays, “Brothers,"
by Lewis Beach, and “A Good Wom-
an,” by Arnold Bennett. The cast
consists of members of the active
Alpha Delt chapter; Gene Francis and
Clarence Fox in the first play, and

MISS GRADOVA AT MANDEL

By Pearl Bloomfield
f^lTTA GRADOVA, the pianiste with the largest repertoire,
demonstrated her brilliant mastery of the piano at a recital in
Mandel hall yesterday afternoon. The arrangement of her program
the varied themes touched upon, the largesse and vigor of her per-
formance, delighted and thrilled the audience to the extent that sev-
eral encores were insisted upon after the presentation of each
group.

The Scriabin ’ onata" opus 30, number 4, was rendered with
a grandiloquence worthy of a Tschaikowsky selection; the final
group of a Chopin Waltz, Mazurka and Etude were presented ro-
mantically, emotionally but with masterful and relentless passion.
The only thing lacking was the tenderness, resignation that one ex-
pects in a Chopin theme. Miss Gradova’s playing shows this lack
throughout. Rudhyar’s ‘ Stars” was dull and flat in places because
it was without wistfulness and tendresse. Yet the rest of her second
group was a series of gems—real musical gems such as the music-
lover seeks and seldom finds.

Gitta Gradova’s recital was reminiscent of the Fanny Bloom-
field Zeisler performances; we will look forward to her next ap-
pearance at the University with eagerness.

reason for the poor showing
Seniors was that there were

NATATORS TO ELECT
CAPTAIN AT DINNER

Maroon natators, both varsity and
freshmen, are to engage in the final
meet of the season next Monday
evening at six o’clock when they swim
into a six course meal at Hutchinson.
This banquet will conclude a fairly
successful year for Coach McGillivray
at the close of every season as a
and his mermen, and it is looked to
crowning event.

Speeches by the coach, the captain,
and other prominent members of the
swim team are in order at this time,
and the election of captain for the
following year makes it an import-
ant part of the year’s program.

Five

High Schools Send
Applications In

Preparations have been made to
handle the largest group of swimmers
that has ever participated in a swim-
ming meet in a Chicago district on
next Friday and Saturday when over
250 hoys will participate in the Uni-
versity of Chicago Cook County In-
terscholastic Swimming Meet.

Teams are expected from Lindblom,
Lane, Hyde Park. Parker, Senn, Carl

The university track team is to have
an event all to itself at the big bankers
meet on next Friday night. The race
which has been arranged especially for
the universities athletes is to be a mile
match run between a team composed of
the varsity stars and another team com-
posed of freshman luminaries. The offi-
cials of the meet, which is one of the
most important each season, have put the
event on their schedule feeling that it
will bring added interest and local color
for the city’s track fans, and also be-
cause it is sure to bring out some very
pretty running.

The two outfits which are to pit their
speed against each other have already
been chosen by the coaches. The choices
were made with the past winter seasons
performances as a basis and as a con-
sequence the runners are afl of long
proven ability. The varsity team is
made up of these men: Jimmy Cusack,
Captain, bugan, Hogevich, Boynton,
Dystrup, Kent, Hitz, Koenigsburg, Kel-
sall, and Owen, while the freshman team
has these names on its roster: Gist,
Burke, Williams, Jackson, Reitan, Hil-
ton, Steer, Ault, Van Pelt, Stitt, and
Noore. The winners are to be deter-
mined by the usual match race. The
first man in will count one point, the
second man in two points, the third three
points and so on down to the twentieth
runner in who will receive twenty points.

Three of the four regulars around
whom Ohio State’s 1926 baseball
•team will be built are Varsity cap-
tains. The quartet is all that re-
mains from last year's strong Buck-
eye nine.

Besides Captain ‘ Don” Sloteman,
pitcher, the Varsity skippers who are
also ball players include “Marty”
Karow, captain-elect of the football

team,
chosen
forces,
rounds

and Arlie Tarbert, recently
to head the 1927 basketball
“Bennie” Dempsey, who
out the quartet, is also a two-

sport man, having been a basketball
regular last winter.

Three of the four veterans, too,
are unusually versatile. Tarbert, for
instance, has played eight of the nine
positions on a baseball team. He was
once a catcher, but has seen only fly
chasing and mound duty with the
Varsity.

Coach MacGillavery has appointed
an able and efficient stat! from the men
who are familiar with tank meets
through their participation in the Uni-
versity’s own contests and he is sure
that they will do their part most satis-
factorily. He also has invited prom-

lend their aid to the success of the
affair. The officials chosen are also
all of the best, so that the personnel is
as nearly perfect as is possible.

Several teams have already sent in
their entry sheets. Englewood, Lind-
blom, Hyde Park, Senn, and Lane all
have entered their stellar men. Thus
when the rest of the entries come in
there will be a list that promises
plenty of keen competition and lots
of fast swimming. The men will all
have opportunities to do their best

We have a man in our house who re-

he was suspended from school. A few
days later he returned, and met the
dean as he was going into Cobb hall.
“How is it,’’ asked the dean, “that you
are back at school after I have sus-
pended you?”

“Well, you see dean,” the fellow
said. “I did stay out all last week, but
it said on the envelope to return after

Yesterday the tennis team reported j
for its first meeting of the year, j
Loudly the crowds jeered at them as!
they passed by. tennis rackets in hand
and gym shoes on their feet. “Ya
otta get snowshoes,” a little boy
yelled. Heedless to these slights the
men plodded onward through the drifts '
until they finally reached the tennis
court. “Be brave men—be brace,” the
coach pleaded with his team. Then,
with stern, resolute faces they all sat
down and tied the tennis rackets on to
their feet. ‘T’m’it’ for King of the!

। Dr. Leonard D. White, professor
• of public administration at the Uni-
. versify, starts yesterday on a tour of
| twenty-eight cities in the United
States to study the achievements of
the city managers. His study, part of
a series conducted by the committee
on local community research, will
' take a year.

The investigator proposes to find
out how the city managers in vari-
ous municipalities handle typical
problems of administration, their re-
lation to the commission, budget-,
making, how they deal with profes-
sional subordinates, the part they
play in local politics, how far they
lead the community.

The office has proved to be well
adapted to smaller cities where there
are fewer cross currents of politics
and social adjustments than in larger
communities. Whether it could be
put into practical use here, where
। racial, political and economic factors ।
loom large has yet to be determined I
by Prof. White’s survey, which is |
the first of its kind attempted by j
an educational institutional.

Professor White has no definite
opinion on the subject, but will pur-
sue his investigation scientifically,
weighing ail the evidence for and
against the plan before he publishes |
his conclusions.

Leaving this morning on the first
leg of his trip which will take until
the first of June, Prof. White will
visit cities where city managers are
now actively at work: Wichita, Kan-
sas; Ft. Worth, Waco and Houston,
Texas, Phoenix, Arizona, Pasadena,
Long Beach. Stockton, Alameda and
B e r k 1 e y, California, Colorado
Springs and Dubuque, Iowa. Larger
cities will be studied later.

Experts who have analyzed the
subtle quality of the Nighthawk
style find that absolute rhythm, ori-
ginal orchestration, and polished
timing are part of the number of
things that make the Nighthawk
music what it is. The boys are re-
puted to especially understand ev-

ery whim of the saxophone, insist-
ence on the complete tone quality of
which is one of the big items in the
cult of Coon-Sanderism.

Specialize in Harmony

A remarkable smoothness char-
acterizes the Nighthawks, who play
in perfect, blending accord. The or-
chestra is not one of the so-called

“trick” ones; there is no expectorat-
ing in the slide trombone, or other
ungentlemantly but (in the public
estimation) “hot” tricks. The Night-
hawks, it is true, are complete mas-
ters of the “break”, but that is their
own business, unless, you find it be-
comes your own by unduly agitating
you.
