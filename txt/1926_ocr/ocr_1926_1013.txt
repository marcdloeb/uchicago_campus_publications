UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1926

WHAT OF

In an accompanying column this
morning, one Louis Kassel has come
to the defense of Phi Beta Kappa, an
institution treated with some levity
in this column the other day. Mr.
Kassel is well qualified to speak on
his chosen subject. A graduate of the
university, he was a prominent under-
graduate in his day, having been a
member of the society to whose de-
fense he was so valorously come, and
a leading contributor to “The Whis-
tle.” With these qualifications, it was
no wonder that the Phi Betes turned
as one man to Mr. Kassel in their
hour of need. “The appeal that I de-
fend the position of Phi Beta Kappa,”
said Mr. Kissel Monday afternoon in
approaching me with the proposal that
his rebuttal be printed in The Maroon,
“was not altogether expected. Indeed,
I already had my article prepared when
the petition from my brother Phi Betes
came in." So Mr. Kassel, you see, is
not only a man of conviction and of ac-
tion, but also a man of foresight.

* * « *

Mr. Kassel’s article is a model of
sound sense and good judgment. In
this it differs (as Mr. Kassel pointed
out to me) from the usual tours de
force that appear in this space. Mr.
Kassel’s stand, indeed, can hardly be
budged from any angle of approach.
I. for one, have no desire to budge it
—were that possible. I am happy to
see the campus, or that part of it rep-
resented in the Phi Beta Kappa so-
ciety, taking such a marked interest
in this column .even if that interest
has its outlet in the writing of indig-
nant “Vox Populi” letters in to the
editor. It shows that what is set down
in this column is being taken at face
value, or considerably more than that,
by the collegians. This indicates a
hedthy condition of affairs. So I cry,
“Long life to Mr. Kassel, and all like
him!” It is such as he that makes a
column conductor’s life passably worth
living.

♦ * * *

If I may presume to look at Mr.
Kassel’s argument with a critical cock
of my head and all, I should point out
as the one weakness of his entire ef-
fort the deadly seriousness which
characterizes it—a seriousness that re-
veals itself from any angel of ap-
pn ach you may take in looking at his
letter. In the first place Mr. Kassel
takes me seriously. This can be par-
doned. In the second place, he takes
the entire question (if any) seriously.
It may, I admit, be of the utmost grav-
ity: but somehow the thought persists
in cropping up in me that the world
will go on revolving about its axis on
an angle of 23 1-3 degrees, whether
Mr. Kassel proves me to be in dead-
ly error, or whether he doesn’t. In the
third and last place, Mr. Kassel takes
himself seriously. Everything else I
am inclined to let pass; but this is un-
forgivable.

While I am on the subject of com-
munications received, I shall also cite
an anonymous note which came in
referring to a recent column on the
club rushing situation. It closed with
the touching testimonial, “Here is a
wish that every freshman woman will
read it!” if this sort of thing keeps
»u, it may develop into my being cited
as a tonic (like Father John’s or Cod
Liver Oil) for use by the collegians
when afflicted with any ailment. This,
°f course, is a utopian expression of
hope on my part. It is hardly likely
to he realized in this life. Still, I can-
not resist giving voice to it. For all
columnists are believers in the Ideal
State. If they weren’t, they’d be read-
ing other people’s column, instead of
writing their own.

Fans Next Saturday

While the fighting Maroons are in-

noon. the students will be cheering as
enthusiastically as if the game werej
being played on Stagg Field. For Wil-
liam Weddell, head cheer leader,
promises that two members of his staff
will conduct organized cheering in
Mandel hall, where the returns will
be received by radio.

Through the courtesy of Station
WMAQ, W. A. A. has arranged for

five cents.

Alma Mater Too
Slow, Needs Pep.

Prohibition has been a complete
failure, according to the undergrad-
uates of the University of Wiscon-
sin, who made plain their convictions
in the student daily paper. The en-
tire state of Wisconsin has been
stirred by the article.

The students stated that they are
convinced of the incapability of the
Prohibition experiment to rectify the
moral problems of today, especially
temperance.

“The extreme Volstead law has
proved a failure,” the article stated.
It went on to say that it had only
been proven a failure, but that it
has wrought evils on the youth of to-
day, particularly the college student,
that cannot be undone.

“The finger of shame has been
pointed to the college students of
their violation of the Prohibition law.
We, who are members of the student
body of a great university do not
propose to draft a defence of the ac-
cusation by saying there is no viola-
tion. We know that there is. Wheth-
er drinking at the university is on
the increase or decrease is not for
us to say. We should say that it is
probably lessening, but that is be-
side the point. To us, it would seem
much more preferable to have each
of one hundred students drink legal-
ly a glass of good beer than to have
one incapacitate himself with a bot-
tle of rot-gut alcohol, the article con-
tinued.

The Wisconsin men went on to say
that it is not difficult for students to
secure liquor, which is frequently
done to commemorate the passing of
examinations, football victories, and
other special occasions. They added
that a local bootlegger guaranteed
ten minute delivery to student room-

Says Mr. Evans

Has Mack Evans jazzed the Alma
Mater?

“I have no objections to being
credited with the introduction of jazz
rythms in the orchestration of the
Alma Mater,” said the musical direc-
tor when questioned in regard to the
innovation.

During the past summer Mr. Evans
visited Mrs. Paul Manderville, wife
of the arranger of the Alma Mater,
who is head of the Conservatory of
Music at Augustanna College, Rock
Island. She admitted that the Alma
Mater was sung in too slow a tempo,
and that her husband would be in

A number of papers throughout
Wisconsin copied the editorial and
commented on its astounding frank-
ness. The secretary of the univer-
sity was busy answering telephone
calls and replying to letters from
students and outsiders as to whether
the Daily Cardinal expressed the
opinion of the university.

Not To Be Defied By Raillery

The Phi Betes Put Up Defence/

This message of defense found its
way into The Daily Maroon office
yesterday afternoon. Apparently di-
rected against the light manner in
which the columnist on this page
speaks of Phi Beta Kappa, the pro-
test is printed in full and in the orig-
inal.

Mr. George Morgenstern,

The Daily Maroon.

Sir:

It is not my custom to praise Phi
Beta Kappa, an organization of which
I am a member; indeed, I have ac-
quired a considerable reputation as
one inclined to undervalue the honor
that membership is supposed to in-

volve. But I cannot permit an at-
tack so unprovoked as yours, so il-
logical, so—in the vernacular of the
herd—half-baked, to pass unchal-
lenged. Firstly, I intend to show
that it is fitting to reward him whom
you called a grind; secondly, I hope
to prove that it is the rule, rather
than the exception, for a brilliant
fellow to become a P. B. K.; and last-
ly I shall indicate certain other fea-
tures of your article which I consider
ridiculous.

PLAN SEND-OFF FOR

PENN TRIP THURSDAY

Elaborate plans are being made for
a big pep session to be held prior to
the departure of the Maroon football
team for Pennsylvania this Saturday,
according to an announcement made
by A. A. Stagg, Jr.

The student rooters will meet in the
circle, in the center of the campus on
Thursday morning at 11 o’clock. The
plans include a cheering demonstration
and a noisy send-off.

Following the pep meeting, the foot-
ball squad will be hurried into waiting
taxis and taken to the Englewood sta-
tion where it will entrain on the
Broadway Limited at noon. The stu-
dents will parade to the station, fol-
lowing the team. More yells and
cheers are scheduled for the final
send-off at the station.

The alumni special will leave for the
east on Friday. There will be but this
one trainload of rooters for the Ma-
roon team the few students who were
undaunted by the mandates of the
faculty against student excursions—
and the alumni followers of the “Old
Man’s” teams.

“ ‘Father’s Day’ is a word formula
for a good idea,” President Max Ma-
son said yesterday in a statement to
The Daily Maroon. “With us I hope
the day will be one of frindly, inti-
mate meetings. We want the fathers
of our students to see us all for a
whole day—at work and at play.
Saturday, Oct. 23, has been selected
by the committee in charge for our
first gathering of this character.

“We shall try to exhibit our work-
ing plant in the morning, our work
and play game in the afternoon and
the straight play in the evening. Fac-
ulty and students alike will have a
share in it all. I wish to give the
project my hearty approval.”

It was under President Mason’s
supervision and guidance that the
tradition of Father’s Day was begun
at the University of Wisconsin.

EVERY RELIGION

AT UNIVERSITY

Y. M. C. A. Data Shows
Wide Scope of Faith

With the possible exception of
Pantheism and a few others, every
conceivable religion seems to be rep-
resented in the university by at least
a small group, according to statistics
recently compiled by the Y. M. C. A.

This information, which was de-
rived from the registration cards of
the students, shows that the Metho-
dists have the greatest representa-
tion with six hundred and eighty-six;
the Jews are second with six hun-
dred and fifty-eight; the Presbyter-
ians have six hundred and sixteen;
and the other religions range from
four hundred down to one or two. '

Largely due to the fact that over a
thousand failed to indicate their pre-
ference, the information is far from
accurate. As far as it goes, however
it shows that the University is, in
common with most other great edu-
cational centers, composed of prac-
tically every religious faith known.
A sum total of five thousand one
hundred and three men and women
expressed their preferences, while
one thousand and sixty-nine failed
to do so.

Kerwin to Address
Newman Club at

Meeting in Harper

Prof. Jerome Kerwin, of the Uni-
versity department of political science
will address the Newman Club, Catho-
lic student’s organization, at its first
meeting of the quarter at noon today
in Harper M-ll.

The Chicago branch of the Newman
club last year reached a membership
of 200 and this year plans a program
with which, according to Jim Lyons,
president of the club, they hope to at-1
tract the entire group of Catholic stu-1
dents at the University.

Planning to meet every two weeks,
the organization includes both round
table discussions and addresses for its
short pre-lunch meeting. The Newman
Club is a national society and has
chapters at every large University in
the country.

President Max Mason yesterday
sanctioned a plan which, it is thought
will bring hundreds or even thou-

sands of fathers of University stu-
dents on Saturday, Oct. 23. The
event is to be “Father’s Day,” the
first to be held at the University.

Clyde Keutzer, senior, has been
named chairman of a committee that
will have charge of the function.
He has announced a brief outline of
a program which he has been work-
ing on since last Spring quarter.

The outstanding event of the pro-
gram is the Chicago-Purdue football
game. Through cooperation with
Coach Alonzo A. Stagg, director of
athletics at the University, a block of
seats has been reserved for the fa-
thers. This section of seats will
probably be either in the north or
south stands and can be reserved by
students at the football tickets of-
fice by showing a tuition receit.

On the morning of Father’s Day
a tour of the campus will be conduct-
ed, when the sires will visit all the
buildings-! on the campus and will
have an opportunity to see the Uni-
versity in action.

A dinner will be served in the eve-
ning in Reynolds club house follow-
ing an open house there. Invitations
to this dinner will be issued to every
father. ।

Following the dinner a vaudeville
show will be staged in Mandel hall
and this will conclude the celebra-
tion.

It is expected that Father’s Dry
will become a University tradition
and will be put on a par as an ac-
tivity with Settlement night. Presi-
dent Max Mason, Coach Alonzo A.
Stagg and Dean Chauncey Boucher
have not only approved the plan but
are also devoting their time to make
it a success.

PRINCE SENDS GIFT
OF SWEDISH BOOKS

Three hundred books written in
Swedish by the leading novelists and
historians of that country have been
presented to Harper Memorial Libra-
ry by the Crown Prince Gustav Adolf
who received the degree of LL.D
from the University last summer. Sig-
natures of the Crown Prince and the
Crown Princess Louise and a list of
the books presented are included in a
bound parchment book of presentation.

A number of the volumes will oe
placed in the library of the Wiebolt
Modern Language building upon its
completion.

Boucher To Talk At

Inter-Greek Meeting

Dean Boucher will address the
members of the Interfraternity coun-
cil, at the meeting which is to be held
tomorrow night at 6:15 o’clock, in
the Delta Tau Delta house at 5607
University Avenue.

The Dean will advance some new
plans and ideas to be carried out. A
dinner will be served previous to the
meeting. Plans for the annual Inter-
fraternity ball will be announced.

Mr. Prentice pointed out that too
frequently children are separated
frolff their parents to be cared for in
an institution which returns them
later in life, both physically and men-
tally unfit for competition. He claim-
ed that when this is the case, millions
of dollars are lost annually and sug-
gested that the beginning of caring
for children was not in spending mil-
lions on foster care, but in preventing
conditions which necessitates this
care.

A SUGGESTION FOR THE EXAMINERS

A MONG the more incredible fallacies which flourish in university
X x offices is the one which presuppose? that the good men are the
men who get good marks. There is a relation, no doubt, between
goodness in marks and goodness in men, but it is far from a neces-
sary relation.

Our university, during the past two decades, has come into such
a position of affluence and good repute that it can be highly critical
in its selection for men for admission. The bureau of Admissions has
been gradually raising its standards, which is a perfectly normal and
healthy thing for a bureau of Admissions to do.

We comment not upon this standard-raising process, but upon
the nature of the standards. The critique, it seems, is marks. Appli-
cants who by casual brilliance, or by the grind imposed by feelings
of inferiority, or by an exaggerated opinion of the value of good
marks, or by an inexpensive brand of intellectual ambition, have suc-
ceeded in attaining in high school the grades necessary for admission
to the University, are welcomed without more inquiry than a formal
recommendation from the school principal.

One of the bases of selection, and, we believe, the most import-
ant basis, is undeniably the scholastic standing of the applicant. But
scholarship should not be the only standard. The personality of the
individual should be taken into account, his whole background, the

tiality. Second, such a mass of information is not easy to gather.
But the situation is not impossible of solution. There is a enough
agreement among men about what constitutes such goodpess to make
extremely valuable distinctions. Surely there is enough ingenuity in
the bureau of Admissions, and enough loyalty among alumni investi-
gators to somehow gather the information.

Selectivity on such abroad basis, with no hard, fixed standard of ■
grades would improve the quality of the material with which the

University must work. Selectivity on a basis of grad
the ability to pay tuition, is unwise.

Suggests Solution

Development of workingmen’s
compensation laws, adequate in-;
comes in all trades, and conservation i
of health were Mr. Prentice’s sug-
gestions for solution of the problem. I
The Philadelphia sociologist is on his

ATTACK OF EARLY SEASON GAMES

Branding scouting as harmful
to football, Yale and Princeton
Universities have signed a non-
scouting agreement, according to
the Yale Daily News.

Commenting on the action, the
News says that scouting deprives
the game of any surprises and any
•science and is one of the factors
responsible for the great bally-hoo
about football “over-emphasis.”
The News says further that it is
pernicious rather than wholesome
to watch the enemies camp with
the purpose of getting all of the
material pertaining to the enemies
attack and that any clever decep-
tions that a team may have are
worthless when rival scouts have
studied them in earlier games.

Coaches Jones of Yale and Ro-
per of Princeton were the princi-
pals in the new agreement and the
eastern college papers are unstint-
ed in their praise of the two.

Urbana, Ill., Oct. <31.—If the fu-

past, the Illinios-Iowa football game
in the Illinois stadium at homecom-

contest. The Illini and Hawks have
played fifteen games in the last 27
years and most of the time the bat-

eyes with nine victories as against
six credited to Iowa. The Illini have

Captain Wally Marks is the only
player left who played as a regular
against Pennsylvania last year and
he will be handicapped when he en-
ters the game this year by bruised
leg muscles and a slowly healing char-
ley-horse. Stan Rouse, halfback and
Wolff, guard, this year’s regulars
were subs last year and were in the
game for only a few minutes. The

“Mystery Team” of the conference.

Coach Young was blessed with such
splendid sophomore talent this Fall
that six of last year’s regulars spend 1
most of the time on the bench. Penn’s
backfield, made up of Rogers, Mur-
phy, Paul Scull (a heady player),
and Waseolonis. is ideally suited to
execute the Warner type of play to
perfection. Rogers is one of the best

Penn not only utilizes an ultra-1

much use of long forward passes of I
the Dartmouth type. All of the Penn
regular backs, and Rogers in particu-
lar, are adept at passing the oval,
and in Captain Thayer,,.; generally

scene of a rather non-descript win
by the Stagg-men but in the Mary-
land game the team showed more
power. Chicago completely eclipsed
the southerners. Coach Stagg used
thirty-one players in the fray, a fact
which makes the victory all the more
impressive.

vania, Yale and Dartmouth ranked as
the three outstanding elevens of the

the Quakers will be a top-heavy fav-
orite to repel the Maroon invaders.
Chicago’s hopes rest almost entirely
on the line and Capt. Marks who will
back up the forward wall. If the Ma-
roon linesmen outplay the easterners’
line, and if they refuse to be sucked

The 13 to 0 score counted against
Coach Cappon’s crimson and blue ma-
chine is a fair indication of the relative
strength of the competing teams as
they played Saturday. Wisconsin’s line
was much improved over the week be-

not functioning properly. But of the

approximately twenty-five per cent

of the Freshmen rules were abolished
as the result of student agitation. This
was about the same time that the ex-

the dear old school, and comes early
to every practice, and stays late, and
never, in all his four years, gets off
the third team, but is awarded a let-
ter anyhow for his long though fruit-
less labors, the air rings with loud
huzzas, and he is considered a fine
fellow. When a youth with what the
Army calls a G-6 intelligence enters
school with the determination to be
business manager of something or
other, although he is innocent of
arithmetical lore; when this youth
labors with diligence, learning to add,
and less accurately, to subtract;
when, in late May of his last year,
some too-trusted individual leaves
suddenly for Cuba, and he is ap-
pointed to fill the vacancy, everybody
is overjoyed at his success, and all
are united in the opinion that it was
well deserved. In short, when a
man, woman, or child struggles to
victory, becoming vice-president,
making the chess team, leading the
prom, or even getting out of Graded
Gym, his fellows, with the exception
of a disgruntled few, sing loud his
praises, rejoicing with him in his
glory; always provided the honor in
question is not P. B. K. For if this
be the reward of his long labors a
myriad voices are raised against him,
the echos of the campus wrath are
heard from Cobb to the School of
Ed, and rumors of his disgrace pene-
trate even to Ike Bloom’s and Al
Tierney’s; wherever he goes, he can.
not avoid the damning accusation,
“Grind!” Yet in the face of univer-
sal disapproval I maintain that toil
over books is at least as deserving of
collegiate recognition as other varie-
ties of labor.

In my preceding paragraph I have
been discussing the student of aver-
age ability, or little more. I now pro-
ceed to the very rare individual of
genius, even in its most attenuated
forms; to the person capable cf
thought which is at once original and
coherent. I could cite statistics,
but I shall refrain unless pressed;
for the present I shall content my-
self with the statement that it is
merely necessary for such a person
to get A in one-third of the courses

taken to make certain of getting
the average required for P. B. K.
membership. This is surely not a
difficult achievement for anybody who
possesses real ability; the only excuse
a person who claims such ability
could give for failing to achieve P.
B. K. would be insufficient time devot-
ed to courses; but if the time was so
woefully insufficient as the failure
would indicate, he had better avoided
college altogether.

Thus we find that, like most other
honors, Phi Beta Kappa may be
achieved by a wide variety of peo-
ple, and that the effort necessary is
greater the less the ability of the
individual. It seems to me that this
condition is wholly reasonable; cer-
tainly it is sanctioned by universal
custom.

* • • *

I cannot point out, in any reason-
able space, all the errors you have
made; but I must mention the fact
that your version of what Phi Beta
Kappa stands for is .inaccurate, that
your statement of its original pur-
poses is misleading, and that, con-
sidering the population of the South
in 1776, the original predominance
of Nordic blood in its members is in
no way remarkable. Finally, I ad-
vise you to think before you burst
into your flowing cadences, and to
ride your pen instead of letting it
drag you around.
