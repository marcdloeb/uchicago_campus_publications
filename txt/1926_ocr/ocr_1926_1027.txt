WHAT of IT?

MARS DEFIES ASTRONOMERS

For years the question of the sys-
tem of fraternity rushing and pledg-
ing has been the bugaboo of the In-
fraternity Council. Yearly the boys
on this solemn body get together and
talk things over, and yearly the end
of all their efforts is nothing. It is
conceivable that the boys on the
Council try to accomplish something;
indeed, they hold many meetings, and
all strictly under Roberts’ Rules of
Parliamentary Procedure. The repre-
sentatives take their work seriously,
but somehow or other a new system
of rushing and pledging has never
been run through.

* * * *

The leading proposal for a change
in the existing order of affairs has
always been either to inaugurate sec-
ond quarter pledging, or to hold off
entirely until the sophomore year.
This second suggestion draws much
of its support from the fact that it
has worked, and is working now, at
other colleges. Dartmouth, putting
the sophomore system into effect this
year, thinks its advantages far great-
er than those of the old first year
pledging. Sophomore pledging, well
as it has worked at Dartmouth and
Yale, among other places, is never-
theless, I think, hardly a possibility
as a working system at Chicago.

• ’ ♦ ♦ •

There are at the most about six
hundred men entering the university
in the fall; part, at least, of this
number would not be considered
“likely” under the admittedly snob-
bish standards of the clubs. So, with
a smaller group of eligibles left,
there are thirty fraternities on hand
seeking to pledge a delegation. With
three classes supporting the house
under such a system, instead of four
as is now the case, these fraternities
would have to pledge a larger delega-
tion than they do now. It is a ques-
tion of doubt whether out of a group
of, say, five hundred, every one of
the thirty clubs could get a satisfac-
tory class of fifteen. To pledge much
less would run the house bills up to
unheard of totals. Then, too, under
sophomore pledging, the smaller frat-
ernities would have difficulty in get-
ting delegations as satisfactory as
they do now, for the larger organ-
izations would conceivably have the
edge under such an arrangement.

* * * •

Second or third quarter pledging, |
therefore, would seem to be the
best system to give a try, should the
Interfraternity Council ever decide
to take the plunge. An arrangement
of this sort would have manifest ad-
vantages. It would, on the one hand,
give the fraternities a chance to
know what they are getting when
they pledge, and not six months af-
terwards as is the case under the
existing system. It would work
against “misfits” in the groups. On
the other hand, second or third
quarter pledging would give
the freshmen an opportunity
to get going on t r e i r college
work without tre distraction
of a fraternity during the first cru-
cial months. It would result, very
likely, in less of them flunking out.
It would, further, give the freshmen
a wider range of acquaintance than
if they were included in a limited
circle that would be largely self-suf-
ficing, for during the first months,
they would be forced to seek their
friends in the run of the class. Add
to all this the fact that a freshman
with one or two quarters to look the
fraternities over, instead of one or
two weeks (at the most) as is the
present situation, should be able to
make a wiser choice in his fraternity
than he can now, and thus more se-
curely insure rimself lasting rappi-
ness through his college life, and you
have a very good argument for the
proposed system.

Plan Two Days of Entertainment
For Second Annual Homecoming

The best that twenty-two alumni
headed by William E. Lyman, ’14,
can produce in the way of entertain-
ment, will be provided for the 17,000
or more alumni who will celebrate
the second annual Homecoming of
the University, November 5 and 6.

Aside from the feature of the two
day jubilee,, the (Chicago-Illinois
game, the homecomers will find their
spare time, while they are not clap-
ping each other on the back, filled
with a gala string of events ranging
from touchball to dancing.

“Yale-Harvard” Game

Friday afternoon, the frosh will
play a “Yale-Harvard” game to top
off the regular schedule of intramur-
al touchball. Homecomers and stu-
dents will mass together Friday eve-
ning to display their confidence in
the Maroons at the pep session, the
climax of the day coming in the alum-
ni banquet at 6.

Packers Convene;

No Junior Chapel

Juniors may enjoy an extra
twenty minute loaf today, while
the meat packers convene in Man-
del hall during their regular chap-
el period. No speaker was sched-
uled.

Vice - president Charles G.
Dawes will officiate at the Ameri-
can Meat Packers conference when
he presents Dwight W. Morrow of
J. I*. Morgan and Company as the
first speaker of the afternoon ses-
sion of the educational conven-
tion.

The morning session opens at 10
in Mandel Hall.

Fears Unwarranted;

Undergrads Continue
To Top Graduates

Effectively dispelling the doubts of
any who may think that the Univer-
sity plans to eliminate the undergrad-
uate school, comes the official an-
nouncement of the autumn registra-
tion of 4,998 undergrads.

Of the 7,751 men and women reg-
istered in all schools of the Univer-
sity, 4,998 are undergraduates and the
remaining 2,753, graduates. Men num-
ber 4,039 topping the 3,712 figure of
the women.

The downtown school of the Uni-

versity claims a 2,753 enrollment,
being included in the 7,751 registra-
tion for the entire University.

These figures, coupled with Presi-
dent Max Mason’s statement backing
the undergraduates, establish the per-
manency of the preliminary Univer-
sity work.

ELSA WELAND TALKS
ON CHILD WELFARE

Two public lectures one by Miss
Elsa Ueland, president of Carson
College for Girls in Philadelphia,
and the other by Dr .R. R. Reeder,
of the Marsh Foundation School,
will be given under the auspices of
the Graduate School of Social Serv-
ice Administration today and Fri-
day respectively at 4:30 in Room
109 of Cobb hall.

“Standards of Institutional Care
for Dependent Children,” will be
the subject of Miss Ueland’s ad-
dress which is scheduled for today.
Dr. Reeder will lecture on “The
Place of the Institution on the
Modern Child Welfare Program,”
Friday.

Saturday the alumni will take
their places in the stadium, while
Stagg’s team battles the Illini be-
fore a crowd of 40,000. Following
the game there will be a mixer in
Mandel hall. For the evening, frater-
nity dinners, class parties, and thea-
atre parties will fill the bill.

Mason, Stagg Talk

President Max Mason and Coach
Amos Alonzo Stagg will greet the
alumni at the Friday night dinner,
which will be held either in Hutch-
inson Commons or Bartlett gymnas-
ium, depending upon the number of
tickets sold. Lyman will serve as
toastmaster for the evening.

With a sellout assured by the foot-
ball ticket office, alumni making late
decisions to attend the reunion will
be in street parlance “out of luck,”
for no special provision has been
made for alumni for the Illini game.
Tickets must be secured through reg-
ular channels.

GREEK COUNCIL
OUSTS TAU SIGS

Organization Fails to Observe
Rules of Fraternity Men

Tau Sigma Omicron has been in-
definitely suspended from membership
in the Interfraternity council. The
, reasons cited by William Harrington,
! secretary of the council, were that the
■ organization had failed to attend the
meetings of the council during the
past year, that they have paid no dues
to the council for the same period, and
that they have failed to maintain a
house at a permanent address as re-
quired by the constitution of the coun-
cil.

The official notice of the suspension
is signed by Harrington as secretary
of the council and reads: “In accord-
ance with the constitution of the In-
fraternity council, Tau Sigma Omicron
has been suspended from active mem-
bership.” Harrington said that if any
members of the organization are in-
terested in seeing their group reinstat-
ed, thy should apply to the council at
the next meeting.

FRANK SWINNERTON
TALKS ON AUTHORS

TOMORROW EVENING

Frank Swinnerton, the distinguish-

this | ed novelist and critic, will lecture in
Leon Mandel Assembly Hall on
Thursday evening, October 28th, on
“Authors, Their Friends and Their
Critics.” As a delineator of English
middle class life he has shown many
of the characteristics of Charles Dic-
kens in style and technique. His lec-
ture will afford him unusual scope
for discussing contemporary authors.
To hear the lecture will be to listen
to the talk of a great novelist and
famous critic and a man of keen ob-
servation.

Tickets may be secured without
charge at the President’s Office.

Rosenthal Elected

Frosh Forum Head

Freshman Forum elected as offi-
cers for the autumn quarter: Donald
L. Rosenthal, president; Eugene C.

Hathaway, secretary. Rosenthal is
known as title holder in numerous
oratorical competitions, and for the
last three years has been awarded the
sectional prize in The Chicago Daily
News contest.

Moment Arrives

BY MILTON S. MAYER,

Staff Correspondent of The Daily

Williams Bay, Wis., Oct. 26.—
Mars slipped out of its place in the
universe tonight, peered coquettishly
through 42,000,000 miles of oblivion,
thumbed its nose at the earth, and stole
mutely away.

While the keenest eyes that science
has produced strained through the for-
ty-inch telescope at Yerkes observa-
tory for a telltale glimpse and the
master jugglers of the heavens pond-
ered and approximated, the enigma of
the skies broke her tryst with Mother
Earth. Although it appeared vividly
brilliant to the naked eye the planet
presented itself to the astronomers in
hopelessly unfavorable conditions for
observation.

Expected At Eleven

Eleven o’clock tonight found ihe
great dome of Yerkes a hollow mass
of blackness streaked across with
stars where the massive eggshell had
opened to project the telescope. A few
tense silhouettes took form on the ob-
servation platform at the base of the
great camera, and a guarded silence
hung over the group of newspapermen
in the little balcony. For Mars, ever
so near and always too far. was go-

man of the committee, assures those
who are planning to attend this im-
portant social function that there are
many pleasant surprises in store for
them.

Band Well Known

“Bobbie’s band is very well known
among dance goers around the Uni-
versity,” Harrington said, “and it is in-
deed a favor to be able to secure such
good music.” A prominent orchestra
has always been secured for the ball,

Stanley Freid has been added to the
committee in charge of the dance and
he will be in charge of the entertain-

Tickets Out Soon

Tickets to this affair will be placed
in the hands of the fraternity presi-
dents for distribution sometime during
this week. The price will be the same
as last year, $3.75 a couple. Harring-
ton says, however, that the good time
had will easily offset the price of ad-
mission.

According to Harrington, this year’s
ball is going to be a novel affair in
almost every way. Many startling fea-
tures have been planned for the big-
gest Greek affair of the year but as
yet the committee is not divulging
them.

Purdue Supporters

Thrown For Loss

Two Purdue-Chicago battles
were staged Saturday afternoon.

Purdue won the contest on
Stagg field 6-0. Chicago won the
contest under the east stand by an
overwhelming unofficial score
when several supporters of old
Purdue, financially depressed but
spiritually exalted, tried to effect
an entrance to the big tent by
what the Good Book calls “other
means.”

Head usher Jim Flexner, star
of the national championship gym-
nasts, stepped right up and fell
to for old Chicago.

Shoreland Draws
University Crowd
to Football Teas

Tea at the Shoreland hotel after
the game has become the popular Sat-
urday afternoon rendezvous for Uni-
versity men and women. Whether or
not the dreamy atmosphere of the Cas-
tillian room and the melodies of Walter
Ford’s orchestra furnish a much de-

sired contrast to the bleak gray of
Stagg field is hard to say. At any rate
the rendezvous is at the Shoreland and
from 5:30 until 7, one may dance on
Saturday afternoon—if—of course, the
aforementioned one, has a buck and a
half. And possibly after the Illinois
game Maroons may have joys to ex-
press or sorrows to drown.

ulty will read and heed:

To the Editor of The Daily Maroon,
University of Chicago.

Permit me to express enthusiastic
approval of the great idea behind the
new day on your calendar—“Fath-
ers’ Day.”

I had the good fortune to partici-
pate in the festivities Saturday and
am frank to say that President Ma-
son and Mr. Stagg did great service
to the institution in their after-din-
ner talks. Dr. Mason was very wise
in attacking the most hurtful error
regarding the institution which has
come to my view: namely, “that the
University of Chicago cares only for
the Post-Graduate worker and lets
the Under-Graduate body take the
crumbs.” Mr. Stagg, likewise, show-
ed high sagacity in emphasizing the
sense of fruition and the general
happiness which every father feels
w’hen he sees his son or daughter be-
stowed under the care and tutelage
of your great Institution of Life,
Learning and Liberty of thought.

AWARDS GRANTS TO

SOCIAL SCIENTISTS

Small gran’s in aid of research in
the humanistic and social sciences will
be awarded to a limited number of
mature scholars by the American
Council of Learned Societies. Appli-
cants should be accomplished in scien-
tific methods of investigation, engaged
in constructive projects or research
and in actual need of such aid. Letters
of request should be mailed not later
than January 31 to Professor Guy
Stanton Ford, chairman of the Com-
mittee on Aid to Research, University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn.

The maximum amount of any sin-
gle grant cannot exceed $300. Only
scholars who are citizens of the Unit-
ed States and who are permanently
domiciled or employed therein may ap-
ply. Grants will not be awarded for
the purpose of aiding in the fulfill-
ment of requirements for an academic
degree. Previous award of a grant
does not exclude an applicant from
consideration a second time, nor does
it give him preference.

night, and he has since reiterated the same thought.

Thus
other

In recent years both alumni and undergraduates have

been

fearful that such an abolition might come about. Not that there was
any real basis for their fear—merely rumor, the great increase in
graduate enrollment, and the increases in undergraduate tuition. Then
too, the faculty has at times seemed opposed to many of the phen-
omena which, here as elsewhere, characterize undergraduate life.

With these facts known to everybody, the wild imaginations of
some people went to work, constructing the theory that the powers
tha be had decided upon a slow but sure freezing out of all under-
graduates. Of course, no sensible person believed in this theory.
None the less, it is good to have a perfectly definite statement such
as President Mason s to refute them with.

effacing, too modest, too little- in-
clined to give the student body the
powerful elan, the tremendous accel-
eration. the magisterial inspiration,
of their personal enthusiasms of
their personalities per se! they should
“mix!”

That I am a citizen of Chicago at
all refers to a night forty six years
ago when Professor Richards of your
forerunner, “Chicago University,”
came to a small town in Ohio to
lecture a la Michael Faraday on “the
Wonders of Chemistry.” The person-
ality and charm of that man drove
me through years of chemical study
and drew me to Chicago where I
was sure I should find the spirit of
Professor Richards in every depart-
ment of life and thought. And I
did: For I soon came into contact
with William Rainey Harper, J. Laur-
ence Laughlin, Goodspeed, Barrows,
Walker, Ryerson, Hale, Burnham,
Michelson and Millikan—men who
have fashioned the plastic clay of

It is astonishing that campus people who search the downtown

Mandel Hall are ideal.

Every second Wednesday the best symphony orchestra in the
middle west performs for the delight of University people here
on our own campus. The University Orchestral Association actually
brings into Mandel Hall the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, directed
in person by Frederick Stock, to play the same splendid scores of
the Friday and Saturday Orchestra Hall concerts.

The concerts need no advertising. They draw heavy crowds.
But not student or not even University crowds. The afternoons of
the concerts University Avenue and Fifty-Seventh Street are lined
with the expensive limousines of local music patrons. These people
are venerable enough, no doubt, and much to be respeetd. But the
concerts are intended for University people.

MAROON GR1DDERS
START TO CLIMB
FROM LATE SLUMP

Five Men Out Because Of
Injuries; Team Works

on Shifts

It seemed at practice last night as
though the Maroon team is really be-
ginning to climb out of its slump.
Signs of the form which have in form-
er times made for champion teams
are beginning to show up in spots.
Coach Stagg is working hard to have
the new shifts perfected, and the' old
plays have been polished up.

Greenebaum Shows Well

The coaches feel able for the first
time, to pick a regular team for the
week. Greenbaum has been doing
great work of late, at tackle, and if he
keeps it up he will start in the game
Saturday. The men who will prob-
ably start the Ohio State game are
- follows: Apitz and Spence at the
ends, Wolf and Greenebaum tackles,
Wcislow and Cameron guards, and
Ken Rouse at center. In the backfield
Stan Rouse will play left half and
Wally Marks or Anderson right half.
Levers will be at fullback and Mc-
Donough at quarterback.

Many Injuries

Anderson who hurt his knee in the
Purdue game has not shown up for
practice as yet. Fouche is out with a
bad shoulder. McKinney came out for
practice yesterday for the first time
since he was hurt. Hocrger and Free-
man were out yesterday. Lewis is still
in bed.

The team as a whole is working
hard and faithfully, and if determina-
tion counts for anything, Ohio State
will not have an easy battle on its
hands.

UKENS STUDENT TO
CHIMPANZEE IN SONG

“In the days of the Chimpanzee” is
the name of a song just completed by
M. .J Breen of the University physiol-
ogy department, known to the campus
as physiology’s poet. \fr. Breen is
the author of a number of songs and
poems on subjects related to physiol-
ogy.

Mr. Breen received his inspiration
from observation of the customs of un-
dergraduates here, and the song has a
distinctly satirical tone. He compares
modern times with those of the pre-
historic past and finds that after all
they are essentially the same.

The music is written in waltz time,
and although not original, carries the
words very well.

Native Indians Give

Stadium To Haskell

Five thousand Indians will gath-
er at Lawrence, Kansas this week
to celebrate for four days the open-
ing of the stadium of the Haskell
Institute, a school for Indians. This
stadium is the modern substitute
for the bloody battlefield of their
forefathers, and in the future the
younger generation of Indians will
do battle ehre, clothed in helmet
and moleskin instead of paint and
breech-cloth,

Blackfoot Indians will come from
Montana and from other states
will come the Sacs and Fox In-
diAns, the Pottawatomies and the
Osages.

rite Haskell Stadium cost ap-
proximately $200,000 and it was
built purely with Indian money Ml
donations from white men being
refused.

An elaborate program has been
arranged for the celebration. On
the evening of Oct. 28, a huge In-
dian cast will present Hiawatha in
the stadium and native dancing con-
tests will occupy- the following eve-
ning.

On the following day the stadium
will be dedicated by a football game
between Haskell and Bucknell
University.

STATISTICS SHOW

VALUE OF TANK

Coach McGillivray of the swimming
team, during one of his lengthy per-
usals of those impressive looking
documents commonly known ate
aquatic notes, came upon an article
last week that should of great inter-
est to the University students, in
fact it may become the basis of one
more big Chicago rushing point. This
article was found in the municipal
code of the Citv of Cleveland. It
stated that whenever the number of
bathers exceeded one for every twen-
ty-five gallons of water, pools must
be disinfected or emptied

After a great deal of intensive fig-
uring and tearing hair “Mac” final-
ly and proudly announced that he
had come to the conclusion that at
this rate one thousand people could
swim in Bartlett pool every hour or
about seven thousand in a day instead
of four hundred as they do now. The
reason for the immense increase lay-
ing in the fact that the tank is
equipptd with one of the best cir-
culation systems in the country.

OHIO STATE WILL
BRING POWERFUL

TEAM TO MIDWAY

Karow and Two New Backs
Clark and Kruskamp, Are

Wilce Aces

By Bill Hadfield

Ohio State has an unusual and pow-
erful team this year but it will have
a tough fight with the Maroons if re-
ports from the practice field have any
authenticity. It is rumored that the Ma-
roon men are boiling over and fighting
in practice with a zest that is worthy
{ of a University of Chicago team. But
the Ohioans have been tearing into
their freshman team with such spirit
that it is, also rumored by those who
have seen the Buckeye practice, that
tthe Maroon fight will be as straws in
the wind against them.

New Backfield Stars

However, the Maroons must realize
that Marty Karow, Ohio’s fullback is
one of the hardest men in the Big Ten
to stop. Karow has not only shown
his ability to knife the center of the
line, but has demonstrated he can
skirt the tackles and hold his own in
a broken field. Ohio State has two
other regular backfield men who have
not been seen carrying the ball this
year, but merely have been used as
blockers, at which art they are excep-
tionally adept. This pair is Kruskamp
and Clark.

Wilce Plans Surprise

A lot of people have looked at
Kruskamp’s oversize shoulders during
a game and wondered if he really
could carry the ball if he were given
a chance. Clark, too, never has given
much reason to believe that he’d be
a terrible flop were he allowed to run
with the ball. Whether Dr Wilce will
continue to play the game with two
backs as ball carriers and the other
two as consistent blockers or spring a
surprise and bring forth another ex-
pert ground gainer in either Krus-
kamp or Clark, is an extremely puz-
zling question for the Maroons.

FROSH ATHLETES

LIKE MINOR SPORTS

According to Coach McGillivray,
the men out for the Freshman Swim-
ming Team are a rather likely look-
ing crowd. However they need de-
veloping and have been practicing
against the Varsity in many heated
water polo games. Some of them
have never had an opportunity before
to show what they could do and the
tryouts last week were featured by
some astounding times. W. F. Stt-
phenson swims the torty in 19.1, Max
Wadley negotiates the hundred in 57,
G. A. Keeder slips through the 400
and 220 in time equal to that of the
Varsity, and K. H. Bauer shows up
very well in he 200 breast strokt.

Have Few Wrestlers

Coacr Vorres, of the wrestling
department has only ten freshmen
out and issues a call for thirty more
men. His main inducement is that
tht men are divided into groups of
four ranging in weight from 117 to
over 175 pounds and this enables
even light men to win their num-
erals. Some of the best prospects
are Mikesh, Hochstcdler, Cornell and
Miller.

The fencing department is pro-
gressing in fine style according to
Coach Merrill. The Freshmen are
generally better than in orevious
years and the squad is somewhat
larger than before. Many of the
men have had two or three years
previous work and this facilitates
matters immensely.

DELIS, DEKES, AND TAU DELTS
FIGHT TO VICTORY IN CLOSE GAMES;
NO FORFEITS TO MAR PLAY

Armstrong Score Three Touchdowns For High Point
Honors; Spectacular Runs Are
Numerous

Spectacular runs, catches, and pass-
es were the ordinary occurrences is
yesterday’s list of touchball games. All
of the teams displayed amazing speed
both on the offense and the defense,
and the perfection of .team work gave
rise to a multitude of intricate plays
and passes. Armstrong of Alpha Delta
Phi was the high point man of the
day, scoring three touchdowns. His
feet was rivaled in brilliancy by a 70
yard touchdown from the kick-off. ex-
ecuted by Widman of Sigma Nu.

Tau Delts Win

Repeatedly missing chances to score
Tau Delta Phi was still able to roll
up a 12-0 score against Beta Theta Pi
in a Beta league contest. Leffman
crossed the line with the first Tau
Delt score in the first few minutes of
Play, and the other marker was chalk-
ed up by Sj old, the individual star of
the game. The Betas presented a fair
offense, but a rather weak defense.

In another Beta league tilt Delta
Kappa Epsilon handed Delta Chi a
close 6-0 defeat. Tieko who starred
throughout the combat, snatched a long
pass in the first quarter and scored the
winning touchdown. The teams dis-
played a speedy offense and both goals
were in constant danger.

Alpha Delts Strong

With the scintillating Armstrong
leading the way, Alpha Delta Phi was
able to pile up an easy 24-0 count
against Phi Delta Theta. McRoy add-
ed one touchdown to Armstrong’s list
of three, and joined with Gerhardt
and Marsh as stars of the Alpha at-
tack. The Phi Delts showed little
power and could not withstand the
team work of the victors.

Delta Tau Delta and Phi Sigma Del-
ta engaged in a close combat which
resulted in the Delts taking the long
end of a 6-0 score. The great num-
ber of intercepted passes put both
teams in positions to score, and after
a long pass from Edelstein to Cap had
given the Delta Taus their winning

margin, they were required to main-
tain a tight defense. Priess proved to
be a very versatile star in the victor’s
offense, and it was his passing and
kicking which lead to the touchdown.
Crawford put up a fine defensive game
for the losers.

The final contest of the day was also
one with a rather lopsided score. Tau
Sigma Omicron fell before the power-
ful Sigma Nus to the tune of 24-0.
With Widman starring in the attack
and being able to get away with a
“Red” Grange feat, the Sigs had little
trouble in crossing the goal line. Cur-
tin, Barker and Price all helped Wid-
man along, and registered one marker
apiece.

Tarpon Sponsors

Unique Swim-fest

Tarpon will give a swimming exhi-

Louise Majonnier, who is in charge
of the costumes, and Irene Althiede,
chairman of the decorations.

The exhibition will be an aquatic
version of an old Indian legend. “By
giving such a demonstration each quar-
ter, the club hopes to promote interest
in water sports among the women of
the university,” said Harriet Ray, pres-
ident. In regard to the exhibition Mrs.
Katherine Whitney Curtis, swimming
instructor said, “No other college
swimming club for women can equal
Tarpon in the finish and skill of its
exhibits.”

via their column, The Campus Scout.
This time, it seems, we have aroused
their heavy petulance and bitter sa-

ment of the tickets for the Chi-Illini
game. We hardly feel it necessary to
make a retort to these uncharitable
gestures on their part, but we do

Some Social Notes

Sweet Sir:

Strangely enough, Notre Dame and
Northwestern went to the same place
to give vent to their feelings after
the game Saturday night. One crowd
hilarious over the victory, the other
steeped in gloom (pardon the trite-
ness) and yet both were at the in-
evitable Dill Pickle, inevitably tight!
Ha-ha, Turk, they were so polluted
that each forgot which had won, and
in fact, if I mistake me not, rooted
the wrong school. But anyway, you
imay take this from a female, North-
western boys sail under the weather
much more gracefully than Notre
Dame.

—Cynical Sophie

. NOW that Morgenstern speaks
what of it, why don’t the fraternities
adopt a system similar to that em-
ployed in the Major league base-
ball teams? After all, it isn’t par-
ticularly just that certain houses
should have the monopoly on certain
brands of freshmen talent. With a
Juitable system of waivers and trades
t might be possible for the boys to
put across some big frosh deals—
pne potential Phi Bete for two base-
ball players,—two numeral men for
ft fuicoated specimen; a lad, with
family, who can wash windows, for
gqy with a wide acquaintanceship
|n high school rushing circles, and ad
Infinitum.

—TERRIBLE TURK

WAR GOD NEARS EARTH
BUT STILL RETAINS
ITS SECRETS

(Continued from page 1)
turbance on the planet give us only
a flickering image and destroy any
possibility of learning whether or not
life exists there. The appearance of air
within the last hour blurs the surface
of the body beyond hope of observa-
tion.”

A scuffle in the background — the
newspaper men are gone, and the still
ten silhouettes on the platform are
left alone with their twenty-ton cylin-
der of steel gazing sleeplessly at the
truant star. Professor Edwin B.
Frost, director of the observatory,
does not stop to think of the times
that his now unseeing eyes have1
penetrated the lenses but work untir-
ingly through the eyes of his assistants.

“If we can get three clear nights,
during this opposition.” Professor
George Vanbiesbroeck declared, “we
should get several new views of the
planet. Our only hope lies in the use

of a metallic mirror which will

be

utilized as a huge reflecting telescope.”
Abandon Hopes

Although the planetograph recently
completed by Professor Frank Rose
at Mt. Wilson observatory will be
mounted today, all hopes of finding
evidences of life such as is known on
the earth has been abandoned by as-
tronomers.

“It is due to the rainy eqinocial
season on the planet that, if there
should be such a thing as intelligent
life on the planet, the inhabitants
would have to commute from the
north to the south poles twice a year,”
said Professor Frost. “A hurried trip
across the Martian equator, which has
an average temperature of about 60
degrees at noon and 100 degrees be-
low zero at night.” would be neces-
sary.”

The temperate zone of the war god
planet offers more tolerable climatic
conditions, according to Professor
Frost, but the American would find it
comfortable to make a speedy dash
from the northern part of the planet
to the southern at the outset of win-
ter, after the fashion of the golden
plover.. In order to maintain life on
Mars the human would have to equip
himself with lungs to breath air thir-
ty times more rarified than that on a,
high mountain peak.

More than one hundred photographs
are to be made during this opposition,
one of the longest and most favorable
in the annals of astronomy. The pho-
tographers hope to traverse the entire
arc of the sky, and are bent on pro-
ducing vastly better results than they
did in 1924, when the planet paid its
last fly-by-night visit.

The next few days may give birth
to many startling revelations. But the
golden moment—11 p. m., October 26,
1926—is no more. And the plaything
of the skies— tonight within a stone’s
throw of 42.000,000 miles from the
earth—has melted into the infinite for
perhaps 4 2.000,000 years.
