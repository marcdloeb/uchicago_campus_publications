My advices of the other day, em-
anating from an indignant Maroon
footb^l player, in regard to an all-
star team picked by the “Daily Illini”
were, I am informed by that august
sheet, all wrong. When the other
day the athlete in question came
rushing up to me with the informa-
tion that the Daily Illini had cast a
grave affront at Mr. Stagg’s merry
men, and went on to demand that
I, in the cause of truth and justice,
right the wrong, I went about the
job without further ado, just as one
of King Arthur’s boys would buckle
on his mask, chest protector and shin
guards in the old days, get on his
high horse, and go out to pop off
somebody or other with his lance. I
did not attempt to verify the ath-
lete’s story at the time. I accepted
it—it seemed so probable. “Mine not
to question why,” etc. I just did the
job and took up the white man’s
burden in defense of Mr. Stagg and
the boys.

The Youngest” Can’t
Say “I’ve Nothing to

Wear;” $800 Wardrobe

More than $800 has been expended for afternoon games, din-
ner gowns, and sport clothes to be worn by members of the cast that
will present “The Youngest” tomorrow night at 8:30 in Mandel hall.
The dresses have been furnished by one of the most exclusive stores
in Chicago.

The new scenery which was recently purchased by the Dram-
atic association and which will be used for the first ♦•me tomorrow
night was set up in Mandel hall yesterday afternoon. It was used in
rehearsal later in the afternoon.

In the Sunday ‘ Illini” I am told
I am in utter error about things.
The journal of the Greatest State
University did not print that all-
Conference team after all. The
Champaign “News-Gazette,” if I re-
member rightly, did the dirty work.
"The Illini” stands with clean hands.
It pointed this out Sunday. More, it
said that it did not put much stock
in my “malicious” remarks about it
and Illinois. In doing this, of course,
‘The Illini” once more falls into the
error of its old ways: it takes me
seriously again. This I have several
times asked “The Illini” to refrain
from doing. Still, I do not feel
greatly affected by the bitterness of
“The Illini” against me. I feel that
that bitterness is, at bottom, founded
on just as much good will towards
me and Chicago as my “bitterness”
and “maliciousness” for the “The Il-
lini” and Illinois is. For I really hold
nothing against the one or the other.
1 take the Illinois boys, if not as
brothers, at least as very distant re-
lations, and even bear for them some
thing like a homely affection in all
of my vitriolic attacks. That, the Il-
linois boys must admit, is a conces-
sion. It must make their hearts
(beating steadily beneath their blue
shirts) feel better. After all, kidding
can be good-natured, even if, to the
Illinois boys, it seems neither to be
kidding or to have anything good-
natured about it. All’s well in the
state of Illinois and it’s only sixteen
days ’till Christmas. Ring them bells!

Winter Formal, Opens

1927 Social Season

The date of the third annual Military Ball, set and reset by
Crossed Cannon, has been officially announced as Friday, January
’21.

The scene of this first formal of the winter quarter, which is two
years has grown to a place among the University traditions, has not
yet been selected. The Blackstone, Shoreland and Drake Hotels
and the South Shore Country Club are submitting bids. Last year
the ball was held at the Country Club.

PHIL ALLEN TALKS
AS WIEBOLDT LAYS
NEW CORNERSTONE

There has recently been Consider-
able agitation for that haven of the
thirsty, the weak and the forlorn—
the Coffee Shop—to remain open un-
til the hour of 10 p. m., very late
when you consider that the place
closes at 5 now. The movement for
' heese Sandwiches at Later Hours
has gained heavy backing among the
discerning classes of the campus. It
has been shoqted for in the streets,
demanded in “The Maroon”—torch-
hght processions even are an emin-
Pnt possibility. All this is nice
enough but I think nobody has gone
to the bottom of the matter.

Three former presidents of Fed-
eration will speak at the banquet to
be given Tuesday from 6 to 8 in
the sun parlors of Ida Noyes hall.
The dinner is held in celebration of
the one hundredth open council
meeting of the organization.

Presidents who have accepted the
invitation are: Helen Thompson, Fay
Millard, and Mrs. Lenox Rey. Music
will be furnished by Muriel Parker,
pianist; Edwarda Williams, violinist,
and Evangeline Williams, cellst.

The cornerstone of Wieboldt hall,
modern language building now under
construction on campus, will be plac-
ed with appropriate ceremonies next
Tuesday, it was announced last night.

Dr. Phillip Schuyler Allen, head
of the Germanics department, will
open the ceremonies with an address.
The building itself cost $500,000 and
is a gift of W. A. Wieboldt, from
the Foundation established by Mr.
and Mrs. W. A. Wieboldt. It will
close in the breach in the University
wall flanking the Midway.

EDUCATION SCHOOL
FROLICS AT PARTY

Robert A. Milliken, University
professor, world renowned scientist
and lecturer, is one of the principal
speakers of the Y. M. C. A. confer-
ence Dec. 28 and Jan. 1. Professor
Milliken is to discuss the relation of
science and religion in regards to the
general theme of the conference: “Is
Christianity the way out for the life
of today?”

Representatives of all parts of the
world will attend. ,

The Milwaukee conference is to be
the first national joint student affair
that has ever been attempted by the
two Christian associations. "Students
are coming from universities and
colleges all over the country, and in
each case they are thoroughly pre-
pared to carry on an intelligent dis-
cussion about the subject at hand.
The University alone is sending 33
delegates to the couniyk * .

These delegates have been Coached
by Dean Bowen in otdk11^ ftyat they

TO HOME EC. CLUB

For who wants to eat or drink par-
ticularly between 5 and 10 p. m? Not
L certainly. I am eating at the frat
house, lying around at the frat house,
and doing other things (not at the
frat house) at this time of theeve-
ning. No; the Coffee Shop ought
rather to be open between the hours
of midnight and 5 a. m. Then is the
time that the boys, coming home
from their diversions, or restless af-
ter writing their term papers, want
food. So I call on the authorities to
unstop the oak at the Spa between
these hours. And I suggest a couple
of the Midnight Grinds (graduate
school species) of Gates Hall as min-.

Since a recent article in the Daily
Maroon brought to light the fact
that the body of Jack Woods, execut-
ed Drake Hotel bandit, was in the
“cold storage” department of the
University many students have clam-
ored for permission to view the body.
Hordes have attempted to gain ad-
mission to this sanctum.

These attempts have all been in
vain as it is a University regulation
that only medical students have ac-
cess to thi^ department.

Dancing and cards will furnish the
entertainment- at a party to be given
by the School of Education tomor-
row evening from 8 to 12 in the

IS IT A FEAST?

CAYS DEAN FLINT: “Chronic indigestion of the bountiful scholas-
tic feast, spread in sumptuous, bewildering fashion for us here at
the University, finds painful expression in the unhappy faces of a
great many college students.”

We take two exceptions to this statement. In the first place,
we're not sure that i tis a feast, and in the second, we are certain that
the matter of it isnt’ spread before us.

Not being an expert at definitions, we approach the first point
with hestitation. It’s hardly fair o call a forced-feeding process a
feast. And that’s what collegiate instruction, here and elsewhere,
usually resolves itself into. Due dates are set for papers, a cut “sys-
tem” is installed, and we are informed that unexcued absence from
chapel will be tolerated but three times during our undergraduate

career.

In other words, we are note invited to partake of the feast; we
are ordered to. And naturally this results in indigestion. We all
know that something quite serious may happen to the physique of
one who is forced to eat when he is already satisfied. May we not
find an accurate analogy in our American educational system?

What’s the good of tempting men and women to eat when they
know that they’ll have to? A psychologist would probably say that
compulsion in such cases is bound to result in distaste.

After all, the matter finally resolves itself into an examination
of the status of the individual student. If undergraduaes are men and
women they ought to be treated as such. And if they’re not, im-
pose all the restrictions on them that may be necessary to bring them
to order. The supposition the universities now work under is that
undergraduates are men and women. Does anyone notice an in-
consistency?

If the idea that undergraduates are men and women was ac-
cepted, shall we say, a little more wholeheartedly, the probable re-
sult would be the spreading of a feast, not the contemporary in-
jection of food. For man has an innate good sense that tells him
him how much he must eat and when he must eat it. The care of a
man’s stomach is usually left to the man.

GLASS

RS AND MEDITATION

JT ISN T that we do not appreciate the Hilton Chapel. Most of us
are fully aware of its beauty and peacefulness. We enjoy going to
its stillness and silence. Every worldly thing seems to leave us—
a feeling of absolute peace and calm enters us.

And we use it often, even though some of us scarcely admit
that we do. But we rebel at the glass doors. We want to get away
from the crowds, and we object to having those crowds see us at-
tempting escape. “Open for prayer and meditation,” the sign says
—invitingly? We object that also. Who wants to go in for prayer
and meditation with passers-by and workmen drawing conclusions
from our presence and the sign?

Is there any possibility of having those glass doors changed to
stare-proof wood?

Playing the last touchball game
of the season yesterday afternoon
Delta Upsilon defeated the Macs 6
to 0 and won third place in the intra-
mural departments touchball tourna-
ment.

Score Late

The touchdown came at the end
of the first half. Both the D U’s and
the Macs previously had a chance
to score but each time an incomplet-
ed pass went over the goal line and
the ball was brought out twenty
yards in the hands of the opponents.
These same two teams played Tues-
day afternoon and the score resulted
in a tie even after three oyertime
, periods were played. The D U’s by
secret practice and the perfecting of
a few trick plays managed to get the
edge on the Macs and win today’s
game.

Tobey Stars

Tobey of Delta Upsilon, who made
the only touchdown, played an ex-
cellent game and was conspicuous
because of his running and passing.
T. and J. Budlong, Changnon and
Schneeberger, also of Delta Upsilon,

Dope ^points toward either Delta
Sigma Phi, Phi Kappa Sigma, or Al-
pha Tau Omega possessing another
silver loving cup next Friday even-
ing. These organizations have enter-
ed the strongest teams in the Intra-
mural Wrestling Meet and a hard
struggle is expected. There have
been many other entries from frat-
ernities, but few groups have quali-
fied enough men to be considered as
as possible victors.

The number of men competing this
year is larger than that of last year.
Many interesting bouts are promised
in the preliminaries which are to be
held Thursday afternoon at 3:30
o’clock. There is still opportunity for
entry, especially in the hundred
seventeen pound class, for only four
men have entered this division. Any
one, wishing to compete, should ap-
ply to the Intramural Office before
two o’oclock Thursday afternoon.

All men are urged to be present
at the preliminaries. Gold, silver and
bronze medals are to be presented
in every division and a silver loving
cup is to be given to the winning
orgaizaton.

Thomas Brothers The
Original 4 Horsemen

Not so long ago the cry was
“John and Harry” on the Maroon
campus, particularly around old
Stagg Field where the two Thom-
as brothers made football history
for the stellar Maroon squads of
’21, ’22, ’23, and ’24. This year
down on the campus at the Uni-
versity of Southern California it
is “Max and Lloyd,” the two
younger brothers of “John and
Harry.” Max and Lloyd are cut-
ting the same capers in Coast grid
circles that the Maroon stars did
in Conference circles.

MADISON CENTER

OF WINTER SPORT

Madison, Wis., Dec. 9, 1926.—Tak-
ing advantage of her strategic situa-
tion on the hills bordering Lake
Mendota, the University of Wiscon-
sin has developed during the winter
moths an outdoor athletic program
as intensive and far-reaching as that
of any other college in the country,
and has unquestionably become the
recognized leader of the Middle West
in winter sports. King Winter has
looked with favor upon the Badger
northmen this year, as the lake has
already frozen over, the earliest clos-
ing of the waters in the past thirty
years.

With Lake Mendota a solid sheet
of ice, and her sloping shores blank-
eted with a heavy snow, Wisconsin’s
Winter Sport program bids fair to
assume greater proportions than ever
before. Hockey has become the most
popular of the cold weather activities
due chiefly to the three*cornered re-
lationship between Wisconsin, Min-
nesota and Michigan.

We Ask You,—What Becomes of

Our Prep Stars?—We Tell You

“The interest of the nation’s ath-
letes must be drawn to the Univer-
sity of Chicago.”

This is necessary for the athletic
presige of the school is one of the
purposes of the National Interscho-
lastic Basketball Tournament which
is held annually in Bartlett. So far a
great many prep stars have been un-
covered at this tourney, and many
have followed up a brilliant high-
school career with a notable col-
lege one, but few, alas have migrated
to (the Midway.

Lou Behr, playing on the Rockford
quintet, drew much favorable com-
ment when seen in action on the Ma-
roon floor. He has since justified by
being last year’s All-Conference
guard and the bright light of the
Madison five. Molenda and Ooster-
baan of Michigan, Buzz Hogan of
Iowa who hails from Osage, Forrest
Twogood, Sam Barry’s crack sopho-
more who performed here with Sioux
City two years ago, and Zuber of
Kansas, greatest prep center seen
in action on Bartlett floor, are all
products of Stagg’s Interscholastic.

Something of condolence is gained
this year from the appearance of
Capt. Warden who led the Yankton,
S. D., team to the finals in 1923. This
same town sent the valuable John

McDonough to the Maroon squad
years ago and he has proved
prowess for the Midway.

Penstone, Krogh, Sternfield,

In a close battle, last evening, Chi-
cago defeated the Covenant Club
Water Polo Team at the Bartlett
Gym. The practice tilt was hard
fought and the final score was Chi-
cago 7, Covenant Club 4. The game
was the first of the season for both
teams. Nevertheless, despite ragged
Howe starred for the winners with
playing in the tense moments, several
men stood out over the rest. John
four goals. For the losers Lee Slotts
and Bill Wallace did well.

The Covenant Club outfit is an ag-
gregation of young men who have
finished their college careers and
many former university stars are in-
cluded in their lineup. Among them
are J. Miller, former breast stroker
on the Illini squad, and Slotts, ex-
captain of Northwestern team. Chi-
cago men who broke into the line-up
are: Howe, Krogh, Gordon. White,
Hall, Rittenhaus, Olson, and Cuth-
bertson.

Builders of a

National business

Operating more than three hundred
stores, throughout the East and middle
West, the Kresge chgin constitutes a great
national merchandising institution.

The remarkable success of the S. S.
Kresge Company will be surpassed by still
greater growth, New stores are frequently
being added. These require experienced
managers-competentmen, Kresge trained.
There are now a limited number of
openings in the Kresge organization for
young men—college men—to learn every
phaze of this great national merchandis-
ing business, from the ground up. The
men who start now will be in line for
future managerships with excellent oppor-
tunities to make money for themselves.
This is an opportunity well worth con-
sidering. If you are interested, send today
for an application blank. We will then
arrange for a personal interview with one
of our representatives who has already
found success in the Kresge organization.

AN OFFICE-BOY’S PHILOSOPHY
Loneliness

I’m feelin’ sorta lonely in my heart.
Can’t tellya why... I only know
That all the girls and fellas that use
t’ go

Around with me have broke apart.

Sounds funny, doesn’t it...hard, to
realize it’s so. . .

’N yet, there’s only me that’s left
from all that bunch. . .

That’s why I’m feelin’ low.

It’s bad enough havin’ t’ be alone. . .
Lord knows, I miss the jokes and
noise of company...

But that’s not all that worries me. . .
It’s watchin’ all the fellas with their
girls, smilin’ at ’em an’ call-
in’ ’em their own.

While I’ve gotta stand by patiently
and think of all I’m missin’

.. .gee....

I wish I had someone t’ whisper in
my ear and smile at me*. . .
