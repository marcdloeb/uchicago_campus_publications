UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1926

They face a
formidable team
as yet undefeated
in America.

Price Five Cents

It is obvious enough to anyone
who reads this or any column at all
regularly that it is pretty inevitable
that a columnist loses what the Eng-
lish teachers call “tone” now and
then. I, from my own experience,
know, this to be so—but in admitting
it I Uy claim to having the quality
in the first place, an idea which
some of my more lukewarm admir-
ers may be inclined to dispute. How
long a columnist is off key during
these fits of dullness varies. I, it
was told me that last week by one
of my superiors, on advices received
from that mystic shrine, “the Presi-
dent’s office,” so often invoked by
The Maroon chiefs in spurring the
staff on to better things, had of late
been on the downgrade. I did not
argue about it. Perhaps I thought,
I have been. What of it? Such things
occur regularly in the lives of all
columnists. “Shades of Hey Broun
oft remind us”—

It takes no words from others to ।
tell me when, as a columnist, I am
“off.” I need no outside information
to arouse me to a sense of sin, no
heated supplication to arise out of
the ditch, set my teeth, and plough
off up the road once more, my face
beaming in the light of the morning
sun. All such proddings, lyrical or
otherwise, from the outside are nice
in their way, but they do no good,
nor result in a turn for the better.
When, indeed, a columnist gets in the
rut. he can do nothing but sit around
and wait for the next day, with the
hope that he’ll get back into stride,
and turn out “good” stuff once more.
But the stuff that columns are made
of is never good, as I pointed out
here once before; it is merely good
to a degree, within those limitations
that the essential cheapness of jour-
nalism sets up. Column stuff is ‘good’
insofar as it dots for something to
read when nothing better is at hand
or happens to strike the reader's
mood, and does not bore.

I suppose, however, that the crowd
relishes these bad days of mine now
and then. Unschooled in what a col-
umnist must be in order to get away
as such, the mob occasionally likes to
see the fellow who has the day be-
fore stuck his hand in the breast of
his coat like Napoleon, struck an at-
titude like Mark Anthony, and told
somebody or other (the football
team, mayhap, or the Phi Beta Kap-
pa Society) just where it fails to
click,—the mob, I say, likes to see
such a fellow shown up now and
then, shown that, after all, he is not
so good. And in doing this, the mob
is performing as it should, and al-
ways will, perform. For the c rowd,
as a crowd, is lacking in any percep-
tion of the humor or irony of things;
it is heavy with the weight of group
dumbness upon it. As individuals, it
may have, in some cases, perception
and breadth of understanding. But as
a crowd it is a loss. Look at any class
°f Phil Allen’s and you’ll have to
recognize that fact.

*	*	*	*

And so the mob, being as it is,
naturally cannot get the point of
view of the columnist. It cannot
take anything he says with a grain
of salt, but must go crying about the
streets in utter seriousness his lat-
est heresy. It is no wonder that,
mistaken always and understood but
infrequently, the columnist should
now and then wonder what’s tM use,
and let himself slip for a while. What
difference, he asks himself, can it
make? Good or bad, what distinc-
tion can the crowd make, or care
about, if it does. An overwhelming
sense of futility seizes him at thes
times. He loses “tone.” But soon
or late, his sunny disposition comes
limping back, a little battered and
worn, but still there. And now, for
the day, we’re done.

ADD WOLVERINES
TO SYNCOPATORS
FOR GREEK BALL

Two Orchestras to Play
Continuously; Meeker

Is Partner

The Wolverines, direct from the
Book-Cadillac Hotel ip Detroit and
here “on tour,” will furnish a little
music for the social demons who
come up from under a fifteen-minute
deluge of Bobby Meeker’s syncopa-
tion at the Interfraternity Ball next
Wednesday night.

This is the latest move of Bill
Harrington and his committee who
hope to make the Thanksgiving affair
the most memorable “first formal”
yet staged. The bands will be located
at opposite ends of the Shoreland
balllroom and are scheduled to al-
ternate continuously, each playing a
fifteen-minute dance.

Improve Acoustic*

The acoustics of the huge ball-
room are going to be markedly im-
proved by the removal of the heavy
velvet drapes that deadened the mu-
sic at the Score club-Skull and Cres-
cent dance. Decorations have been
elaborately planned and checking
conveniences will be expanded to
eliminate any possible confusion.

All fraternities wishing to have
their songs played and sung at the
ball are requested to hand in two
copies of a song to Stanley Fried at
the Phi Sigma Delta house. This
should be done immediately, accord-
ing to Fried, as the first fourteen
submitted will be accepted.

Y. W. Announces

Date For Bazaar

Annual Christmas Bazaar spon-
sored by Y. W. C. A. will be held
Friday, Dec. 10, from 10 to 5 in
Ida Noyes hall. Dorothy McCoy, who
has been appointed by the Y. W.
cabinet to direct the bazaar, has
chosen the committees. The chair-
men are as follows: luncheon, Fran-
ces Kendall; finance, Betsy Farwell;
freshman grabbag, Clair Davis and
Margaret Newton; publicity, Ellen
Hartman; commissions, Edwarda
Williams; workers, Marcella Ven-
nemma; and booths, Dorothy Gaf-
ford.

Donations to the bazaar are being
given by the women’s clubs and the
Y. W. committees. Luncheon will
be served at 12 followed by a tea
in the afternoon.

Profits reaped on the occasion will
go into the Y. W. C. A. fund to be
used for many of that organizations
charities. Among the numerous serv-
ices that the Young Woman’s Chris-
tian Association supports are a ho-
tel, a hospital, dispensaries, settle-
ment houses, and an employment
bureau.

SYDNEY DEBATERS
WIN OVER KANSAS

The University of Sydney Debat-
ing team has just succeeded in de-
feating the University of Kansas by
an audience vote of 114 to 69. The
Australians are to meet the Univer-
sity debaters next month to discuss
the question: “The World War tend-
ed toward the peace of the world,”
and judging from the rating which
they have received from various pub-
lications they represent an excellent
team.

Junior Class Fee
Due Next Chapel

All members of the Junior Class
are requested to pay their class dues
today during chapel. The class presi-
dent has requested that everyone be
present and have the exact change
which is 25 cents. Collection will be
made by the class council members.

Lost Skull Sings
‘Ain’tGotNobody’

“There ain’t nobody going to
leave this yere room,” said the
Sheriff, “until I’m satisfied he
ain’t got this yere skull secreted
upon his pusson.” Prepare for this
boys, for at any time now it’s
likely to happen. The fact is that
Locker 37 of the Anatomy build-
ing reports the loss—strayed, stol-
en or mislaid—of a nice skull,
which disappeared Monday after-
noon from 27. Thirty-nine little
| medics are crying their eyes out
for the return of their pet.

DEBAT RES READY
FOR AUSTRALIA

Shafer, Gentry and Swiren
on Maroon Team

Practice debates with faculty
members have completed the train-
ing of the University team for the
International debate with the Uni-
versity of Sydney Tuesday, Novem-
ber 23, at 8, in Mandel hall. The in-
vading speakers hail from Australia.

The negative of the question
“Resolved that the results of the
great war have tended toward the
peace of the world” will be support-
ed by the Maroon aggregation com-
posed of Marvin Shafer, George
and Max Swiren with Meyer Gold-
berg as alternate.

In honor of the Australians a ban-
quet will be given before the de-
bate. Tickets are on sale from C.
E. Hayes of the alumni office.

The members of the Australian
team are S. H. Heathwood, J. R.
Godsail and Noel D. McIntosh. They
arrive on campus this week.

WISCONSIN WOMEN
LUNCHEON GUESTS

OF LOCAL W. A. A.

Friendly rivalry and the spirit of
the football season will prevail at
the annual Wisconsin-Chicago W. A.
A. luncheon which is to be served
Saturday at 12 in the sun parlors of
Ida Noyes hall.

Tickets may be secured for sixty
cents from Margaret Nelson, Mar-
jorie Cooper, Mona Flanders, Elea-
nor Wilkins, Carol Hess, or Helen
Walter any time before Friday noon.

Margaret Nelson, assisted by vari-
ous committees is in charge of the
affair.

ROOMING IMPORTANT
SAYS MICHIGAN HEAD

“If we spend all our money sim-
ply for educational facilities and
neglect the home side we are failing
to reach the ultimate goal of a uni-
versity,” said President Little, of the
University of Michigan, in a radio
talk recently. He compared the tak-
ing of students out of perfect home
conditions and thrusting them into
rooming house conditions to the
break that occurs when someone
breaks in upon a speech by arriving
late or leaving early.

“Y” HOLDSOPEN HOUSE

The “Y” is to hold another open
house in the South Lounge of the
Reynolds Club on Thursday after-
noon from 4:00 to 6:00 o’clock. A
unique musical program is promised
and the details of the program will
be announced in#tomorrow*s Maroon.
Over seventy men attended last
week’s open house.

DEVER TO ASSIST
IN LAYING STONE
OF TAYLOR HALL

Two Halls To Complete
Theological Seminary

Buildings

Mayor William E. Dever will as-
sist in laying the corner stone of
Graham Taylor hall, the last unit of
the new Theological seminary group,
tomorrow afternoon at 4. Graham
Taylor, for whom the hall is named
will be present to take part in the
dedication services, being conducted
by members of the seminary faculty.

Taylor hall will occupy the second
and third floors in the section of the
building facing University avenue.
This assembly hall will be used for
all lectures and chapel services held
in connection with the seminary. It
contains a choir loft and will seat
twenty-five people.

Library Occupies Remainder

Hooker Memorial library will oc-
cupy the remaining portion of the
building, the reading rooms being
on the second and third floors and 1
the stacks on the first floor and in1
the basement. Offices* of the depart-
ment will be located on the first
floor also. A tower 160 feet high will
top the new halls and the adjoining
dormitories.

The reading rooms have been
planned so as to give them a soft
:one, lending itself well to study, and
inducing silence.

Sartorial Matters
Hold Spotlight at

Reynolds Tonight

The Style Show being sponsored
by Score Club at 8 this evening in
Reynolds Club theatre, should por-
tray the utmost perfection in a sar-
torial way, with eight more or less
experienced models. Three of the
paraders will be James Cusack, Fe-
lix Saunders and George Percy, rep-
resenting “what the well dressed
college man should wear,” and to
lend the air of reality, the Hub will
furnish the others.

Del Olsen’s Orchestra will provide
the rhythm essential to the best per-
formances of models, not to mention
the best appreciation of spectators,
with a genuine presentation of the
Von Ammon-Drew accordian act. Joe
Barron will illustrate pre-war clog
dancing at its best, and as a final in-
ducement, everything is free.

This is the second annual style
show. “It is given to entertain the
men of the campus and at the^ame
time give them the latest informa-
tion on downtown styles,” said Rob
-ert Harmon, president of Score
Club.

NOT CLASS COUNCIL

SAYS FROSH BOARD

More as a matter of personal pride
and desire for exactitude than to
settle doubt, the Freshman Board of
Management wishes it understood
that it is just that and not the Class
Council as it is frequently and er-
roneously called. The latter is ap-
pointed by the President of the class
upon his election while the former
serves until the elections are held.

Seventy-five Tryout
For Mirror Ballet

Seventy-five women tried out yes-
terday for the ballet of the second
annual Mirror production. Those
women who were selected have been
requested to meet with Mr. Frank
Parker, Friday at 3 :30 in the theater
of Ida Noyes hall.

Faculty Authors
Rotarian Guests

Twenty-five of Chicago’s fore-
most authors including Miss Eliz-
abeth Wallace and Mr. Frank H.
O’Hara of the University faculty
were the guests of a Rotary
club luncheon held yesterday in
the Louis XVI room of the Sher-
man House.

Mr. Edwin Balmer, president of
the Midland Author’s club gave a
short talk. The guests were intro-
duced to an audience of over one
thousand people. Jane Addams,
Clara Luis Burham, Mary Synon,
Harriet Monroe, Wallace Rice and
Donald Richberg were among the
authors in attendance.

SETTLEMENT TAG
DRIVE TUESDAY

Club Women Organize To
Reach $500 Quota

Settlement Tag Day, which will of-1
fer the only possible way for stu-
dents to contribute outright to the I
Settlement Fund, is next Tuesday.
This undertaking is expected to reach
to reach a quota of no less than $500,
an amount which demands fifty cents
from each student and the utmost
cooperation on the part of the stu-
dent body is essential to the Tag
Day’s success.

According to John McDonough,
co-chairman with Virginia Gartside
of the Tag Day campaign, the im-
portance of the University’s part in
collecting the entire Settlement fund
has been growing each year until it
has assumed gigantic proportions.
Tag Daf furnishes an opportunity
for the students to show real gener-
osity in their contributions.

Competition will be held among
the various club and non-club groups
(Continued on page 2)

FINISH CONNECTING
DIVINITY CLOISTER

EARLY NEXT YEAR

Students coming out of Cobb Hall
may not see the completion of the
cloister which is being built between
Swift Hall and Bond Chapel until
next year, according to reports from
the Bureau of Buildings and i
Grounds.

The cloister will provide a per-
manent, weather-proof connection
between the two buildings, combin-
ing beauty with utility. - At present
most of the concrete work has been
finished and the time of the com-
pletion of the cloister depends upon
the weather and the delivery of the
stone.

Y. W. SUBSCRIBERS
‘PAY-UP’ THIS WEEK

Pledges made to Y. W. C. A. dur-
ing its recent financial drive are due
this week, and may be paid either in

the Y. W. office in Ida Noyes hall, or

to the team members who took the
pledges.

This year both the number of
pledges and the amount of the sub-
scriptions failed to reach former
standards. “Unless the students raise
their pledges it will be necessary to
reduce the budget,” said Betsey Far-
well, chairman.

FETE NEW WOMEN

Dean Leila Houghteling of the De-
partment of Social Service Adminis-
tration, and Miss Elsa Chapin, Eng-
lish instructor at the University, will
be guests at a tea sponsored by the
Campus Community committee of Y.
W. C. A. today at 4 in the Y. W.
room of Ida Noyes hall. This is the
fourth of a series of teas which the
committee is giving for new mem-
bers and for freshman women.

SIMPLIFY GRADE
REPORT SYSTEM;
WILL USE CARDS

Graduates and Undergrads
Included in New

Recorder’s Plan

Beginning this quarter report
cards issued by the recorder’s office
will take the place of the undergrad-
uate course book system. The new
plan aims at facilitating and sim-
plifying the reporting of grades and
credits to both undergraduate and
graduate students, according to the
announcement released yesterday by
the University Recorder.

Cards will be made out for all
students, except law students, whose
grades are issued by the dean’s of-
fice. No request for grades need be
made by students as the grades will
be announced ready for distribution
early in the quarter following the
completed one, through The Daily
AJaroon and by bulletin. This regula-
tion applies to the Autumn and
Spring quarters, while cards for the
Spring and Summer quarters will be
mailed to students’ homes.

Flunk Notice* Mailed First

Report cards and special notices
of deficiency will be issued as soon as
possible after instructors’ reports
are received. The deficiency notices
will be sent by mail preceding the
issuing of regular report cards.

Students who do not expect to re-
turn to the University after the close
of the Autumn and Winter squads
should leave stamped, self-addressed
envelopes at the Bureau of Records
for the forwarding of ^eir report
cards. No reports will be given out
by telephone or by personal appli-
cation, except through the prescrib-
ed routine, the Recorde’s office states.

The announcement advises stud-
ents who have course books to keep
them for reference and those who
have uncalled for books to get them
at once.

During the last ten years the use
of course books has been discarded
by many of the larger universities
and the simple method of distribut-
ing “report cards” has been adopted.
This system is expected to cut the
work of the Recorder’s office in two
and will further eliminate all the
complications that the present sys-
tem involves.

Kappa Nu Hosts

At Housewarming
Friday Afternoon

Kappa Nu has invited all students
and faculty of the University to at-
tend a house warming Friday, Nov.
19, from 4 to 6 at 5629 University
Avenue to celebrate the opening of
its new home which was purchased
in the spring and has now been com-
pletely altered and refurnished. En-
tertainment and refreshments will be
provided for the guests.

Law Classes Elect
Officers Tomorrow

Class elections in the Law School
occur tomorrow. In the Senior class
Max Swiren, renowned member, of
the proletariat, is being backed by
three legal fraternities. Rufus Poole,
has the backing of Phi Delta Phi.

In the Junior class G. D. Patter-
son heads a ticket backed by three
legal fraternities. Bruce Brown leads
an opposing ticket supported by
Herb De Young and his Phi Delta
Phi machine.

New York Leads In

College Enrollment

The largest collegiate enrollment
in any one state during the year
1923-24 was in New York where 60,-
623 men and 28,3 70 women were
attending colleges, universities, and
professional schools. Illinois stands
next with a total of 60,462.

WHAT PRICE THANKSGIVING?

MOST of the undergraduate body will “cut” school November 26.

Class will be dismissed Wednesday afternoon and
resumed Friday. Everyone who possesses even an iota of the
old Puritan spirit is going to fill to the brim at the big turkey dinner
and recuperate the following day. Students living out of town will
return to the home lot to show mother and father how they’ve
changed. And they won’t come back until Monday or Tuesday
morning. And who shall say them nay? Who shall say us nay if
we neglect to appear at classes Friday?

We pay, and pay willingly, ninety dollars a quarter for the
privilege of becoming educated. We don’t want to becorpe edu-
cated next Friday. We want to prop our dogs against the fire-
place and read “Christmas Carol,” or the magazine section of the
Sunday Tribune, or “Pilgrim’s Progress,” or whatever it wa^ we
meant to read the day before. We want to play a little poker, mah
jong, or football. We want to see a show, make snow men, or knit
wool socks. We do not, to put it blasphemously, want to become
educated.

The undergraduates will cut whether or not The Daily Ma-
roon advocates insubordination. What we are doing is voicing the
plaint of the students through their official publication. If the ad-
ministration has erred in calling classes for the day after the day
before, we feel not a sense of martyrdom but a sense of pride in
voicing the general student feeling that there is somthing wrong
in this picture.

We shall attend classes Friday, November 26. But we cry
unto a listening or indifferent world that we come not with a shout
and song but with many muttered maledictions against “that's the
way it’s always been.”

EFFICIENCY!

EFFICIENCY! The byword of every business, whether large or
small, has again penetrated the University campus and has come
to lodge in the Recorder’s office.

An announcement made today by that office assures us that
the time-honored custom of working with cumbersome course books
has been done away with and hereafter report cards similar to those
used in high schools and grade schools will be issued after every
quarter to students.

The innovation promises to be a great time-saver, both on
the part of the students and on the part of the clerks in the Re-
corder’s office. Formerly students turned in their books to the
office at a time designated by the Recorder. The grades were en-
tered by the clerks and a definite date set at which time the books
might be called for. Students then waited in line for long inter-
vals while the clerks sought for the correct book. If the students
did not have books, there was the usual red tape about grade cards.
Those who did not possess enough initiative to fill out the cards
troubled the clerks at inopportune times with queries about
grades, losing valuable time for both parties.

With the grade cards substituted, space will be saved in the
office, red tape will be eliminated, and all grades will be available
without inconvenience. It would help if other offices on campus
would look around, see wherein inefficiency is rampant, and follow

Stagg To Meet Badgers
With Badger

Game

By Victor Roteru*

The Badger-Maroon game will be
a battle in the air—so the doings in
both camps indicate. The Maroons de-
voted last night’s drill exclusively to
strengthening their passing attack.
With Marks and Anderson doing the
major share of the propelling .aerial
shots constituted the bill of activity
for the afternoon.

Badger* Alto Patt

Reports have it that the Badgers
whose aerial game was so successful
against the Maroons last year, and
against Iowa last week, are also pol-
ishing their heave ’em and catch ’em
attack. Against the Hawks the Wis-
consin tern completed 10 out of 12
throws which is about as good an
average as anyone can hope for. The
Badgers have depended on their
aerial offense for most of their
ground-gaining this season; their
running attack being nil, especially
so against Minnesota and Michigan.
Rose, sophomore halfback, does the
chucking for Wisconsin, and Welch,
Cameron, and Burrus, ends, are all
admirable receivers.

Although Iowa made 18 first
downs, the Badgers managed to win
by a comfortable margin with 15
first downs most of which resulted
from long passes.

Prestige At Stake

The Maroons will be fighting for
more than one thing when Coach
Little unlooses his Badgers on the
field. They will be playing for a
win over a traditional rival, for their
first conference victory and the re-
stored prestige that will go with it,
and for their major letters, for
Stagg has hinted on numerous occa-
sions that a reversal of form and
score is essentially necessary if the
team members are to be honored with
major “C’s”.

The squad weathered the mid-se-
mester eligibility bans in fine style al-
though Raysson, substitute halfback,
was declared ineligible. So as far
as e/gibility and injuries are con-
cerned the Maroons are on the sunny
side of things.

WHEATON AGAIN — AS

GUSTAFSON’S HOME

Vic Gustafson, who played havoc
with the Maroons in last Saturday’s
game, would probably have been the
boy to have placed Wheaton in the
lime light had not Grange preceded
him. His all around ability has been
an outstanding feature in all of
Northwestern’s games. He duely in-
troduced hemself in last Saturdays’
game by running back the kick off
for a touchdown and was Moon Bak-
er’s big rival for the afternoon’s
honors.

His home town is Wheaton and he
is reputed to have played football
on Grange’s high school team. Hjs
work on the gridiron places him as
a leading candidate for the 1927
captaincy as he has another year to
Play.

BADGERS BOAST

ANOTHER ‘ROUTE’

Madison. Wis., Nov. 1926.—Back
in 1922 “Rollie” Williams, one of
Wisconsin’s greatest athletes, set the
record for the number of “W’s” earn-
ed by any one man. He collected
nine major “W’s” during his brilliant
athletic career. This record is seri-
ously threatened by another “Rollie”
one Rolland A. Barnu, star half-
back on the cardinal football team.

Six Letter Man

This fall it appears that the possi-
bility of Barnum’s equaling the rec-
ord of Rollie Williams and garner-
ing the three letters necessary to
bring his total to nine is almost a
certainty. Barnum is distinguishing
himself again and again as a capable
ball carrier and a punter of no keen
ability.

An important cog in Wisconsin’s
football machine, Rollie is earning
his seventh letter. When the grid-
iron season comes to a close at Chi-
cago this Saturday, he will doff his
moleskins only to replace them with
basketball trunks and will report for
duty to “Doc” Meanwell, Wisconsin
basketball mentor. Barnum has won
two letters at guard in varsity bas-
ketball and is one of the dual cap-
tains this year.

In Baseball Too

Spring will find him in a baseball
uniform receiving the offerings of
the hurling staff. On the diamond
even as on the basketball court and
the football field, Barnum has won
two letters and will no doubt again
hold down his old position behind the
bat.

Six Veterans To Report For Official
Opening basketball Practice Monday

With the football season official-
ly ending next Saturday, the stu-
dent eyes of sportdom will next fo-
cus their attention on basketball.
No definite statement can be made
about this year’s Maroon prospects
but with four letter men back from
last year’s squad and a relatively
good percentage of new material
from last year’s squad at Coach Nor-
gren’s disposal the outlook for a suc-
cessful season is fairly promising.

Three Practice Game*

The official practice will start next
Monday, when the following men
are expected to report; Captain Sac-
kett, Hoerger, McDonough, Zimmer-
man, Farwell, and Macklind. These
men of the last year’s squad will be
assisted by Gist, Caplan, Cooper,
Murphy and Kerber. While the sea-
son hasn’t officially opened, a large
number of the boys have been work-
ing out in the afternoons on drib-
bling and passing so that the rough
spots will be smoothed out by the
time the first call is issued.

The following practise games have
been scheduled; Michigan Aggies,
Butler and Ames on December 18,
30, and January 3rd, respectively.

OHIO NEWSPAPER

PLACE FOUR STATERS
AS ALL-AMERICANS

Ohio State despite its defeat by
Michigan feels that it has a very
fine team this year. They are even
going so far around the Buckeye
school as to start counting their All
American chances in numbers above
one.

The Toledo Times has named
Ohio State football players as possi-
bilities for this year’s mythical hon-
or eleven. Their sport writers have
seen all of the important national
games but even so they are still firm
in their convictions.

The paper listed its town represen-
tative, Fred, Grim, for a halfback
position, Marty Karow at full-back,

Alex Kleinat center and Ed. Hess,
recipient of national honors last
year, at guard.

Badgers Allotted
Big Cheering Block

Twelve thousand five hundr loy-
al Badgers will be on hand Saturday
afternoon to cheer Wisconsin on in
the game which spells “final” to the
season s’program.

The same number of tickets have
been allotted to the visiting school
as were given to Illinois, but it is
two hhousand eight hundred more
than were allowed them last year.

Bring “All Americans”

Accompanying the team will be
the prize band of one hundred pieces
whose inspiring songs are expected to
do much toward a Wisconsin victory.
Others traveling at the expense of
the school is Madison’s team of “All
Americans.” This team, composed
of men who would be good varsity
material but who are ineligible, was
organized at the beginning of the
season. They have been working hard
acting as scrubs and it is as a reward
for their work that they are granted
this trip.

Students are warned to be careful
that nothing they do with their tic-
kets have the slightest semblance to
scalping. Seven people were arrest-
ed before the Ilinois game for re-
selling their tickets at higher than
face value.

I-M INKLINGS

Entry lists for the big Intramural
winter swimming carnival went out
yesterday. The sheets included the
necessary forms for entering a full
team is all‘of the events or for spe-
cifying individual entrants in scat-
tered events. Entries must be in
early.

The semi-final round of the horse-
shoe pitching contest will start next
next Friday, November ninth. The
most skillful players have come
through and the round is sure to be
hot.

“SEAT BUSTER” NEW
NAME FOR SHIVLEY

Bernie Shively, University of Il-
linois guard, who is believed by
Coach Bob Zuppke to be All-Ameri-
can timber, is affectionately known
to his team-mates as “seat buster.”
Zuppke as a post-victory celebration
after the game with the Maroons,
took his douty band of warriors to
a Chicago theater,. Bernie who tips
the springless scales at 208 pounds,
gently eased down into the seat, but
not used to such a tonnage, the seat
neatly broke down. Since all the
wealth and chivalry of the great Met-
ropolis were looking on the incident
caused the husky guard much em-
barrassment while affording the rest
of the group a great deal of satis-
faction.

SENIORSLEADIN

HOCKEY CONTEST

Inclement weather slowed up the
tournament hockey games which
were played yesterday afternoon on
the Midway. Seniors beat freshmen
with a score of 4 to 2 and sopho-
mores dowed juniors 3 to 1, while
muddy fields and a sleet storm ham-
pered the playing of all four teams.

The freshman-senior game was an
upset, putting the seniors in first
place in the championship race. The
freshman keep the sophs from oc-
cupying second place by a half-game
margin. Juniors trail wit hone tied
contest. Today’s game should decide
the winner of first place in the tour-
nament, but the winners of second
and third places can not be deter-
mined until the finish of the last
game.

As the score in games won and
lost by the senior, sophomore, and
freshman teams now stands any one
of the three may capture the cham-
pionship. Experience and superior
team work have offset the senior dis-
advantage of insufficient players.

TO BE FORFEITS

Close Guarding and Long
Passing Determine

Victors

Alph Delta Phi threw a bad scare
into the camp of Psi Upsilon yester-
day afternoon. For the Alpha Delta
came near wrecking the championship
hopes of the Psi U machine, the
works for a while with the 6 to 0 tie
that they held the ex-champions to.
In the only other game of the day
Sigma Nu played beautifully to a
16 to 0 victory over Pi Lambda Phi.
The other four games were all held
to be forfeited.

The Alpha Delt-Psi U fray was
really a battle of close guarding, both
teams shining in that department of
the game. Psi U lost two chances to
score by passes over the goal line,
so that Psi U really had a slight edge.
Armstrong and Macrae starred for
the Alpha Delts both on offense and
defense and Gordon and Libby re-
ceived the Psi U honors. '

In the Pi Lam-Sigma Nu fray the
Sigma Nus by a series of long passes
had their opponents at their mercy.
Hoy scored first at the end of a beau-
tiful march. Then Barker and Cur-
tin, in order, scored twice again for
the victory.
