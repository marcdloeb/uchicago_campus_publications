Dean Wilkins Resigns; Will

■ Continue as Romance Professor

Closing one of tire most brilliant ad-
ministrative careers in the history of
the University, Dean Ernest Hatch
Wilkins has resigned his position as
Dean of the Colleges to take effect at
noon today.

The resignation is the result of ill
health on the part of Prof. Wilkins
which has extended over the last few
years and culminated in a nervous
breakdown during te Winter quarter.
He is at present recuperating from
the nervous attack.

Continues as Professor

Prof. Wilkins will resume his duties
as an instructor in the Romance lan-
guages at the University and is a well
known scholar in this field. Prof. A.
S. Boucher will continue to act as dean
of the colleges until the end of the
Spring quarter.

Issue “Pink” Extras

For Interscholastic

All those on campus and in Chi-
cago interested in the Interschol-
astic tournament that is being held
in Bartlett gymnasium this week
will have at their disposal a pink
edition of the Maroon appearing
every evening at 6 o'clock. This
special edition will be available at
the gymnasium and in the infor-
mation office.

The cooperation of the Maroon
staff with the heads of the tourna-
ment is looked forward to as one
of the special features of the tour-
nament. The difficulty that pre-
sented itself last year, namely the
fact that the Maroon came out too
late to be of much interest, will be
obviated, inasmuch as it will ap-
pear this year by 6 o’clock.

THE WINNERS

My name is

Twenty-four years ago the Univer-
sity of Chicago held its first National
Interscholastic event, and with the ex-
ception of the war years we have been
holding them yearly ever since. Dur-
ing this period, the writer has had the
pleasure of extending the welcome of
the University to several thousands of
high school boys, who have competed
in our National Interscholastic Track
and Field Meets and our National Bas-
ketball Tournaments.

On this occasion, it is my special
pleasure to welcome in behalf of the
University the members of the forty-
two teams from all sections of our
common country who have won their
right to compete in this Eighth Na-
tional Interscholastic Basketball tour-
nament.

We hope that you, one and all, may
be at your best and that you may play
to the utmost satisfaction of your-
selves, your coach and your school..

Awards of Eight Dollars
Will Be Presented

To Prophets

With the coming of any great
sporting event, dopesters strive mer-
rily with each other to pick the win-
ners. The Eighth Annual Basketball
Tournament, being a great sporting
event, will consequently see many of
the wise ones splashing the dope
bucket frantically in an effort to
cover the winners with the spilled
drops.

Knowing about the instinctive do-
ings of man and his constant striv-
ing to pick a winner, the Daily Ma-
roon has launched a contest in which
dopesters, real and embryo, will vie j
with each other in trying to pick i
a winner. Each contestant will pick
four teams, those he believes will be
semifinalists. The lucky one whose
guesses come nearest to the four
teams which reach the semi-finals
will receive a cash award of four dol- I
lars. To the man, woman or child 1
who comes second will be given three
dollars, while to the one who places
third will be given a single bill.

Open To AH

The contest is open to any living
human, man, woman, or child who is
a student at The University pro-
vided that they are included in the
age group that ranges from eight to
eighty. Before six o’clock tomorrow
every team will have played one
game. The sporting public will by
that hour have had time to draw
conclusions about the relative merits
and demerits of the various teams, j

Here’s how to place your choices in
the contest:

Annex Dual Title

। The University of Chicago’s
gymnastic team defeated the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania last week
in a duel meet with the final score
25 to 20 and by virtue of the vic-
tory clinched the dual meet
championship of the country.

The men from the windy city
entered the contest as champions
of the wesern conference and as
Pennsylvania has just completed
its most successful season, beating
the pick of the east, the mid-west-
ern athletes are able to lay claim
to the national title

Chicago had two firsts, Davidson
in the parallel bars and Conner in
the tumbling, while Flexner took
two seconds and a third.

ZANESVILLE HAS

TOUGH STRUGGLE

School Superintendent Quits
Job; Town Squabbles

Excitement over the prospects of hav-
ing a crack team in Chicago for the
National interscholastic rose to a high
pitch all over Ohio, when Zanesville,
emerged from the state tournament on
top. Such excitement as this effected
a war between public opinion and the
superintendent of schools in this town
and culminated in the resignation of the
superintendent.

Convinced that studies should come
ahead of athletics, and that the boys
could not afford to spend so much time
away from home as the tournament
would require, the superintendent an-
nounced shortly after the end of the
state tournament that the team would
not be allowed to participate in the na-
tional. The schoolboard quickly re-

sponded with indignation and was firm-
ly backed by public sentiment, the
mayor, and the press.

It was not long before the citizens of
Zanesville, acting on their own initiative
had raised a thousand dollars that their
team might represent Ohio at Chicago.
The superintendent, however, stood res-
olute in his prohibition as long as he
could, but on finding opposition too
strong, handed in his resignation. The
Zanesville team is now in Chicago, and
they brought with them two newspaper
correspondents from their daily paper.

Gridmen Report for

Spring. Drill Today

Coach A. A. Stagg’s powerful Ma-
roon gridders open spring practice today
with about seventy-five veteran candi-
dates reporting for the strenuous period
of training. Chicago will have one of
the strongest lines and powerful back-
fields in the country if the men develop
as they have been doing. In Chuck Du-
val, Stagg has one of the best forward
passers in the country.

Councils Combine Efforts Tough Battles To Feature

To Put On Elaborate	Initial Games of

“Booster Week”	Tournament

By Victor Roterus

Thirty of the forty teams from here,
there and everywhere each spent a
half hour yesterday afternoon on the
Bartlett floor getting the soundings of
that venerable old gymnasium and
eliminating the numerous stiff joints
gathered on long train rides. Their
coaches then hustled them off to the
fraternity houses or hotels, gave them
a respectable meal and finally sent
them to bed.

Practice in Gym

A crowd, which wished to get first-
hand information on the teams for
divers reasons, witnessed the limber-
ing-up exercises of the entrants. A
few of the* more asserting ones com-
posing the gathering were highly
pleased with the motions of the West-
port, Mo., and the Newton, Kan.,
teams

In view of the fact that practically
the same Westport five was in the
semi-finals last year and that Newton
defeated Wichita, national .champs
1st year, 55-11, in the Kansas State
tournament, it appears that optimistic
speculation over their chances is en-
tirely justified.

Booster Week

To impress the members of the vis-
iting teams with the college spirit of
the University, and to put on some |
show for anyone who wants to look I
at some, the Booster committee of the
Interfraternity and Undegraduate
Councils has cooked up a schedule of
events which will make up Hello W eek
and the events are as follows:

Today, the distribution of Booster!
tags; Wednesday, an all-University J
mixer at the Reynolds club given by
the Freshman class; Thursday, the j
Green Cap club will note April Fool’s 1
Day by a freak costume parade in the
Circle where the winner will receive
something handsome: and Friday, as a I
climax, a big parade, headed by the j
band, and including all “C'and Num-
eral men, fraternities, and clubs, will |
be staged with a prize for the best I
decorated car.

TENNIS CANDIDATES
MEET IN BARTLETT

Coach Doc Reed and Capt. Wallie
Schaeffer sent out the call for tenirs
candidates today and a meeting of all
team members and candidates will be
held this afternoon in Doc Reed’s of-
fice at 2:45.

The Maroons will have a powerful
tennis team in Capt. Schaeffer, Hud-
lin, Hall, Cohn, Shapinsky, and Gene
Francis and Thorpe Darin, the foot-
ball stars all out for the team.
George Lott, the ninth ranking play-
er of the country will be out early
in April to give the Maroons a strong
claim for the title.

By Vic Theis

Torrington High, state champions
of Connecticut, will battle Bracken-
ridge of San Antonio. Texas, at noon
today in the initial game of the Eighth
Interscholastic Tournament. The New
England team has returned with sev-
eral veterans of last year’s squad and
should make the opening game an in-
teresting encounter. Last year the
eastern team won its way to the third
round of the tourney and was only
eliminated after a tough battle with the
strong Wheeler, Miss., aggregation.
I he southern team also has an envi-
able record, defeating the Austin team,
runner-up for the championship by a
decisive 29-24 score.

Cowboys Have Edge

Following this game Cheyenne,
Wyoming, will meet the Fort Valley,
Georgia, team. The cowboy squad,
although somewhat rugged in their
basket tossing, showed good team
work in practice and should have a
slight edge over their opponents. The
Fort Valley team is fast but may be
handicapped by lack of weight.

Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Lewiston,
Idaho, will follow this encounter at
2 o’clock. Both of these teams have
fought their way through tough sched-
ules to their respective state champion-
ships and should make this game a
closely contested one.

Canton. Illinois, runner-up for the
state championship, and Scott County,
Miss., will start their game at 3 o’clock.
Freeport won the Illinois state cham-
pionship but did not enter the tourna-
ment because of the strain of the state
tourney upon the team. Canton, how-

CONTESTANTS HAVE
PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN
AT STAGG STADIUM

All contestants in the Interscholastic
will meet at 10 o'clock this morning
at the west stands of Stagg Field Sta-
dium. where they will pose for the
group picture. This huge photograph,
which shows the complete ensemble
of Interscholastic competitors, is the
only one of its kind to be taken dur-
ing the tourney. So great a gathering
of renowned athletic personages makes
it a picture of great value and unusual
interest.

In 'past years these photographs
have proved very popular as souvenirs
of the great annual meet. De Haven,
official photographer for the meet, will
take these pictures as in former years.
They may be ordered at the Athletic
office by mail, or from Tom Stephen-
son, De Haven agent, whose address
is 5555 Woodlawn Ave.

Two other group pictures will also
be taken this morning; one of the
coaches, the other of the captains.

1900. He taught in the Romance lan-
guage department at Amherst from
1900 to 1904, receiving his A.M. de-
gree from there in 1903. He trans-
ferred from Amherst to Harvard in
1906 and became an instructor in Ital-
ian and Spanish at the latter institu-
tion in 1906-1907. From 1907 to 1912
he was an instructor in the Romance
languages at Harvard, meanwhile re-
ceiving his Ph.B. degree in 1910.

Mr. Wilkins became an associate

professor of the Romance languages
at the University in 1912, and acted
in that capacity until 1916 when he
became a professor. In 1920 Amherst
college conferred the degree of Litt.
D. upon him. Prof. Wilkins became
Dean of the Colleges of Arts, Litera-
ture, and Science at the University in
1923 and served as such until last
Winter quarter.

Dean Wilkins has been the subject
of attacks of ill health for the past
few years. At the end of the school
year 1924-25, he asked to resign, but
the quality of his administrative work
was so high that the University author-

ities would not accept the resignation
and prevailed upon him to serve as
dean for at least the next year. The
nervous attack brought on during the
Winter quarter from over-work forced
Prof. Wilkins to leave his work and
enter the Presbyterian hospital for
treatment. He is at present conval-
escing from the strain.

TO THE INTERCHOLASTIC MEN

WE are saying hello to you this week, gentlemen, not because we
feel bound by a duty. The undergraduate council doesn’t
need to proclaim a “hello week,’’ in order to make us cordial; we
would say it anyway.

We are saying hello, not because we are trying to rush you—
although we want many of you to choose Chicago for your univer-
sity.

We are saying hello, not patronizingly, not out of a paternaj
anxiety for you. We are not trying to take care of you, even if
you are in a big city.

We say hello to you for the same reason that we say it to each
other. You are part of us. You are not strangers; you are not
even outsiders. You are a part of our society, just as the Interschol-
astic, coming round every April, is part of our program. As long
as we can remember you have been with us every year at this time
Of course, many of you have not been here before; but others have
been here in your place, just as others were once here in our place.
The point is that you, like us, are old hands at the game. We don t
have to tell you to make yourselves at home; you are at home al-
ready.

Well, now that you understand all this .... hello.

POLITICAL APATHY

(From The Cleveland Plain Dealer)

"^RESIDENT ANGELL of Yale is concerned about the ignorance
of the average college student as to political affairs and his in-
difference to public matters. He is not pessimistic as to the collegiate
attitude towards higher education. He believes that undergradu-
ates are growing constantly more ‘‘sensitive to the finer values of
college life.”

“If there is a dull area it is the field of political and social
thought and action,” comments the Yale president. “In general, the
undergraduate is ill-informed about political affairs and notably in-
different toward them, except in the presence of an election.

This ignorance and indifference are not confined to the Amer-
ican college. The average citizen is guilty of the same charge. The
cause dates back to the common schools, rather than the colleges.
There is no adequate instruction in civil government to arouse realiz-
ation in the importance of public affairs. Possibly teachers and stu-
dents are not so much to blame, aowever, as the popular trend it-
self that is reflected in school and college administrations.

There has been undue emphasis on business, compared with the
intensive interest in public affairs that characterized the American
people in the pioneer days. Captains of industry have superceded
statesmen in the popular mind as types of outstanding success.

Possibly, too, the allied suggestion of President Angell that he
finds the undergraduates are growing more sensitive to the finer
values of college life may ultimately tend to exalt statesmanship
above commercialism. It may result in bringing back some of the
old ideas, at least in revised form.

Ignorance of political matters must first be remedied, before in-
difference can be aroused. Education in sound, economic thinking
must come before the demagog and the crook can be dislodged
from politics.

Musical tryouts for this year’s
Blackfriars production will take place

day by Paul Cullom, abbot of the
order.

“All the entrants in this year’s har-
mony contest have been working dur-
ing the Spring vacation, and. if the
number of compositions submitted is
any indication we ought to have better
music than ever before,” declared Cul-
lom today. “Keutzer, Bishop, Lillie,
Miller, Smith, and many others of past
Blackfriars fame are submitting songs,
and there have been a great number
of new composers at work.

"Mr. Coleman will be on hand to
judge the compositions. The Super-
iors and members of the staff will
likewise be there.”

Superiors to Meet

Superiors of the order will meet
today at 1:30 in the Blackfriars office,
and the entire staff will convene at the
same time and place tomorrow. All
plans for the production will be de-
cided upon, and actual work is sched-
uled for the near future.

Cast tryouts, according to Cullom,
are set for Tuesday, April 6. Chorus
calls will be made two days later. All
undergraduates wishing to enter the
poster contest may apply at the Black-
friars office today or tomorrow be-
tween 1:30 and 2:30.

Announce Title Later

"We have spent a great deal of time
on the selection of a title,” states Cul-
lom. “Out of all that we have con-
sidered, there are three that seem
perfect in every light. We shall make
the final selection within the next two
days and announce it in The Daily
Maroon before the end of this week.
Since nothing is more important in
drawing the crowds than a title, great
care must be used in the choice of
one.”

Women Excel In
Primping, Eating,
Study and Sleep

Primping, sleeping, cramming, or eat-
ing, university women outdo their male
classmates as shown by a questionnaire
filled recently by students of Northwest-
ern university. Each student was re-
quired to tabulate the way he spent his
time for one week, and the cimpilation
of the data revealed the following facts:

The minimum amount of sleep was
enjoyed by one co-ed, who averaged
three hours daily. The lowest number
among the male of the species was five
hours a day, and the highest seventy-
three hours for the entire week.

The height of vanity was recorded
by one member of the fair sex, who ad-
mitted to twenty-one hours a week spent
in beauty culture. The opposite sex was
not far behind, one of its members ad-
mitting to thirteen hours a week spent
in front of the mirror, in contrast to
several men who apparently never
dressed except while eating or in trans-
portation.

W omen were found to devote more
time to bridge, teas, and dates than men.
Because of dormitory rules, off-campus
students had higher records, one girl rat-
ing over thirty-six hours for the week,
spent in social activities.

Women were also found to hold rec-
ords for both extremes in the matter of
studying. One admitted to sixty-one
hours a week spent in mental exertion,
while another spent only three and one-
fourth hours in this manner.

According to the Daily Northwestern,
no averages of time distribution for dif-
ferent groups have been completed to
date. Only the most radical extremes
have thus far been determined.

er

Dr. Albion Woodbury Small, form-
head of the department of socioI-

ogy and dean of the graduate school
of Arts and Literature, died at the
Del Prado hotel Wednesday evening.

The man who had introduced the
science of sociology into America
lost a four-years’ battle against heart
disease after a temporary rally, dur-
ing which he had conversed with
friends and relatives. Two days af-
ter he had begun plans for a new en-
terprise, the great educator was
buried from Mandel hall, before more
than 1000 leaders in education,
friends and University men and
women.

Was Canby President

After his graduation from Colby
College, near Buckfield, Maine, his
birthplace, Dr. Small held many posi-
tions on the faculty, finally attain-
ing to the presidency of his Alma
Mater. When the late president, Wil-

liam Rainey Harper summoned
most renowned educators in
country to constitute his faculty,
Small was among their number.

During his career Dr. Small held

was editor of the American Journal

Important discoveries which con-
tribute to the University’s research
project, eventually to show the
progress of Ireland’s literary history,,
have been made in England by Dr.
Clark H. Slover, the University
learned yesterday.

Dr. Slover has identified a medi-
eval writer as the author of a life
of St. Patrick and as copy writer of
certain tracts intended to advance
the interests of Glastonbury abbey
whence emanated one of the most
important of the King -Arthur ro-
mances.

The investigator continues in a re-
port of his work soon to be published
by the University Press: “William of

“Gesta

as the author of the
regum Anglorum.” Dur-
period of William’s literary
the monks of Glastonbury

were engaged in an effort to bolster
up the tottering fortunes of their
abbey.

“They had embarked upon a vig-
orous advertising campaign in which
it was asserted that Glastonbury
had been from the earliest times the
place most favored of saints and
princes, Welsh, Saxon and Irish; that
the church could trace a continuous

the first abbot of the monastery was
no less a person than St. Patrick,
rick.

The purpose of the study, to which
Dr. Slover is contributing, was de-
scribed by Prof. Tom Peete Cross
on March 17, to a group of repre-
sentative Irish citizens at St. Pat-
rick’s church. Prof. Cross pointed

to the importance of studying
contribution which Irish culture
literature has made to the world,
phasizing the possibilities which

the
and
em-
the

University of Chicago offered as an
institution noted for its research, and
the need for its research, and the
need for funds with which to carry
on such a study.
