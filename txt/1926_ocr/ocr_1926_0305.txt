Six Ballots Requirde to

Candidates

In the Junior'class election to the
Under graduate council that was held
yesterday, two rflen. Gifford Hitz and
Wendell Bennett, and two women,
Esther Cook and Ruth Burtis. were
selected to fill the four vacant Junior
seats on the council. The newly elect-
ed members will assume their places

of the council.

Parker Hall defeated Ben Goble. 229
to 130. and Betty Graham defeated
Dorothy Kennedy. 189 to 167, in the
election to the Honor commission, the
results of which were tabulated at the
same meeting of the council.

Technicality Decides

Undergraduate council were selected
from the field of eight candidates on
the sixth ballot. In the women’s elec-
tion. Esther Cook received her position
on the first ballot but the choice be-
tween Miss Burtis and Marjorie Coo-
per was decided on a technicality.

Of the six defeated male candidates,
Deemer Lee was eliminated last.
Wendell Bennett was only able to
nose him out by a few votes. Next
to Lee, John Howe lasted the longest
under the elimination system, with
Joe Gubbins next, Leo Stone next and
John Meyer last.

Women’s Vote Close

Miss Cook received 153 votes on
the first ballot and was declared elect-

the appointment by a vote of 134 to
131.

Charles Anderson, president of the
Undergraduate council, in commenting
upon the election of Miss Burtis. said:

Methods for measuring with electri-
cal instruments the virulence or kill-
ing power of pneumonia germs, from
which it is possible to calculate how
much chance the patient has of re-
covery and how much of death, have
been discovered at the University. It
is hoped that the experiments will be
useful in developing a scrum for the
cure and prevention of pneumonia and
to determine how such a serum works,
the investigators say.

The discovery is the result of exper-
iments which have been in progress
for nearly six years. The investiga-
tions were conducted by Dr. I. S.
Falk, assistant professor of hygiene
and bacteriology, who is also director

(chairman), Ted Zimmerman, (sub-
chairman), Kenard Small, Paul
Lewis, William Poole, Rainey Ben-

That Mary Queen of Scots was a
staunch Roman Catholic and a de-
cided contrast to her rival Queen Bess
of England, was the essence of the
lecture of Dr. Conyers Read, who
spoke yesterday at 4:30 in Harper
M-ll. Decidedly the opposite of Eliz-
azeth, she showed many instances of
her femininity and her womanly ac-
complishments.

She was no mean scholar, Dr. Read
hastened to point out, being versed
equally well in French, Italian and
Spanish with some knowledge of Latin
and Greek. She could write, hawk
or shoot; she could sing, dance and
play; she could even dabble in poetry.
She had only to smile. Henrv was
known to have said, and she could turn
any Frenchman’s head.

“It is urged that all the women of

not,” runs the correction. “The es-

For

there are always two kinds of peo-

sleeves, soil their hands, and mani-

“We” are the latter. We speculate
what the show looks like, but we

I’m curious to know what the real

OUR DOWNHILL TRACK

HREE men represented Chicago at the Illinois Relays last Satur-
day. Every other school of any size in the midwest had a full
team at Champaign. Many of those schools are as small or smaller
than Chicago. It is inconceivable that track material of those col-
leges is so far superior to that which comes here to school that Chi-
cago should be able to enter runners in competition with them in the
ratio of three men to their twenty or so.

Of course, Capt. Jim Cusack was sick, and as that wrecked what-
ever chance there was of placing in the relays, there really wasn t
much use in sending down a big squad of men who would be pretty
certain not to place. Still, one would think that there should be
more than three men on the team capable of competing up to the
standards of other American college track men. Apparently there
were not, for only three were sent—and two of those largely because
they were seniors.

The Maroon pointed out recently that Chicago track was de-
finitely on the down grade. It made at that time several sugges-
tions that it believed would help to remedy the existing situation. It
suggested that Mr. Stagg confine himself to acting as Director of
Athletics and head football coach, two duties which, with all his
other interests, would appear to be capable of occupying all his
time. It hinted at a more specialized coaching staff for track ath-
letics. It suggested a full-time coach for track.

The Maroon renews those suggestions. It feels that a system
which can develop only three athletes capable of representing a
school of the size of Chicago in an intercollegiate track meet needs
to be remedied.

College and Education

Methods of Dealing With The
“Exceptional Student’’

By John Patrick Howe

An often-heard criticism of college
class work is that classes are conduct-
ed at a pace adapted to the faltering
steps of the least intelligent students,
and that capable students, as a result,
are not spurred to extend themselves
to great intellectual strides. While it
is evident that there is nothing to
hinder the exceptionally capable stu-
dents from doing advanced work on
their own initiative there is enough
truth in the criticism to warrant action
on the part of the college rules-makers.

The first remedy has been to make

class work so stringent that the
tellectually impossible arc forced
and the mediocre are assure, if
of a growth of “intellectual brawn

in-
out
not
and

muscle," of a plentiful supply of “men-
tal fat.” But the remedy has its evils
too. The exceptional students are so
swamped with the work of preparing
papers and reports and recitations and
examinations that they have no time
for developing initiative in study. They
lose the fine individuality of which
their intelligence makes them capable;
they are ground out of the college
machine with standard “educations."

The “honors course system” for ex-
ceptional students has been the solu-
tion for this problem. Yale, Swarth-
more, Smith, Columbia and other east-
ern schools have adopted some form
of the system with gratifying results.
The details of the plan vary in the va-

rious schools but
as follows:

Students who
selves in the first

the general plan is

have proved them-
two years of college

work to be unusually intelligent and
industrious are allowed, if they choose,
to do all their work on their own in-
itiative. They are permitted to study

whatever subjects they like, with the
| exception that they must elect a ma-

jor subject in which they
pected to become proficient.

Th ex-

study when and where they like, go
to what classes they think will be prof-
itable and in general are freed from
all the restrictions to which ordinary

students

only

rection which they receive is that
which they seek voluntarily in con-
ference with faculty members. At the
end of these last two years of personal
study they are given a searching, com-
prehensive examination in all the sub-
jects which they elected. The exam-
ination is not one of details but one
of principles, of the relations and ap-
plications of these principles, and in
general of ,the student’s ability to
think.

The reception which students have
given these courses has not been whol-
ly enthusiastic. Previous to 1900 a
system similar to the honors course
system was tried at the University
of Michigan and in ten years less
than obe hundred degrees were
granted under its provisions. Most
“exceptional” students and certainly
all mediocre students prefer to mem-
orize a few facts for a few months,
take an examination, and then forget
the subject forever. The recent tend-
ency among students, however, has
been to choose the honors system in
preference to the straight course sys-
tem, which indicates a growing appre-
ciation of the merits of honors courses.
It is safe to predict that this system
will play a large part in the growth
and improvement of education meth-
ods.

KILLING POWER

Jacobson, and H. A. Gussin. They
were started by Dr. Falk at Yale uni-
versity and concluded at the Univer-
sity.

Having obtained a fresh supply of
pneumonia germs from patients in the
Cook county hospital, Dr. Falk and
his assistants proceeded to develop a
method of measuring the killing pow-
er of the germs. A substitute for man
had to be found. From a large num-
ber of experiments it was finally dis-
covered that if the germs were grown
in a certain specified way they would
kill white mice in much the same man-
ner in which they cause the death of
human beings.

The next step was to measure how
much killing power was required in
each culture to kill white mice and
then to measure the readiness with
which the germs were clotted together
or agglutinated by a serum. It was
found that the most potent germs re-
sist clotting the most easily. On the
basis of previous knowledge that clot-
ting is determined by electrical volt-
age between germs and the solution
in which they are suspended, the in-
vestigators built an apparatus for
measuring this voltage.

Then they demonstrated by parallel
experiments that the measurement of
voltage on the germs in more rapid
and simpler than measurement with
animals, thus making a discovery and

SYSTEM

From the studio of WGY in
Schenectady, six miles from the
developmental station, there
may be controlled a great
number of transmitters, one of
which is the first super-power
transmitter in the world.

WGY, together with its associ-
ates, KOA of Denver and KGO
of Oakland, is the General Elec-
tric Company’s assurance to
the American public that radio
broadcasting shell be main-
tained upon the highest
standards.

A new series of G-E advertise-
ments showing what electricity
is doing in many fields will be
sent on request. Ask for book-
let GEK-1.

On the rolling pUns of South Schenectady, in
several scattered buildings, is a vast laboratory for
studying radio broadcasting problems. Gathered
here are many kinds and sizes of transmitters, from
the short-wave and low-power sets to the giant
super power unit with a 50- to 250-kilowatt voice.

Super-power and simultaneous broadcasting on
several wave lengths from the same station are
among the startling later-day developments in
radio. And even with hundreds of broadcasting
stations daily on the air throughout the land, these
latest developments stand for still better service
to millions of listeners.

Only five years old, yet radio broadcasting has
developed from a laboratory experiment into a
mighty industry. And alert, keen young men have
reaped the rewards.

But history repeats itself. Other electrical develop-
ments will continue to appear. And it will be the
college man, with broad vision and trained mind,
who will be ready to serve and succeed.

There is just one thing in

this

“Where Are We Going?” production
that I have seen. Plenty of it, hours
at a stretch. I knew there’d be
hours of that when Frank—I mean
Mister O’Hara—persuaded me (it
wasn’t so difficult) to come out to
help with the lights. We spend these
hours, after the girls have gone,
studying the sets. Try every screen
for every flood, and every strip H
every border, and then order some
more. I knew this would be so, be-
cause I’ve got a memory, and I re-
member how Frank launched Emily
Taft on her career toward Broadway,
with a subtle night-to-dawn-to-sun-
rbe effect, on this same Mandel
stage.

That Chinese sunrise took about
four minutes in performance, and
about forty hours, more or less, n
extra rehearsal for the lights men.
And I ran the lights. Well, there
are a couple of these four-minute-
in-performance, forty-hours-in-plan-1
