1000 STUDENTS
TO MEET PRES.

MASON FEB. 10

WHEREIN THE PROM
MAROON GETS SOME
ADVERTISING GRATIS

All Undergraduates Are
Invited To Attend

Official Reception

Plans are being made to have at
least 1,000 undergraduates attend the
reception for President and Mrs. Max
Mason. Vice-President and Mrs.
Woodward, and Mr. and Mrs. Merrill
which will take place in Mandel hall
and Hutchinson commons next Wed-
nesday night at 7:30 o’clock, according
to Graham Hagey and Aimee Graham,
who are conducting the affair for the
Undergraduate council.

At 7:30 the program will start with
speeches by President Mason and
Vice-President Woodward in Mandel,
after which the assemblage will ad-
journ to Hutchinson, where the re-
ceiving line will be formed ami re-
freshments served. The aides and
marshalls of the University will di-
rect the guests ami assist generally
during this part of the evening.

Merrill Will Officiate

Mr. Merrill, head marshall of the
University and, instructor” in the
French department, will attend the
reception in his official capacity, and
will exercise general supervision for
the faculty.

The receiving line will consist of
President and Mrs. Mason, Vice-
President and Mrs. Woodward, Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Merrill, and Charles
Anderson, president of the Undergrad-
uate Council, who will introduce the
speakers.

The committee emphasizes the fact
that all undergraduate- are invited to
this reception, to hear President Ma-
son and the other speakers, and to
meet them. A few weeks ago in an
interview which appeared in The
Daily Maroon, President Mason said
that he wished that he might become
better acquainted with the undergrad-
uates of the University than he had
during his first quarter here.

First Affair of Kind

Dean Boucher of the college of arts
literature and science will be at this
reception in place of Dean Wilkins,)
who is now recovering from the oper-'
ation he recently underwent at the
Presbyterian hospital. Vice-President
Woodward is the recently elected suc-
cessor to Prof. Tufts, who resigned
recently to devote all of his time to
academic work.

This is the first affair of the kind
given here in many years, and it is
for the specific purpose of acquainting
the undergraduates with President
Mason and the newly elected vice-
president.

At this reception the students will
have the opportunity of meeting the
heads of an entirely new regime, the
president having entered upon his of-
fice but a few months ago, the vice-
president-elect, about to take up his
duties in a short time.

During the few moments be-
tween dances when Husk O’Hare’s
Casino club orchestra is gasping
for breath, Prom-goers need not
be idle. This year’s Prom Maroon
will afford them plenty of amuse-
ment. At least this is the verdict
of George Jones and Al Widdi-
field, who are editing the tradi-
tional publication this year.

Besides the usual pictures of
the prom leaders, the list of pat-
rons and patronesses and the
classified index of those present,
many-new’ features will be added.
One of these will be a complete
history of the Washington Prom
during the . reviously undisclosed
field between the cherry tree and
the first University function, it
was announced yesterday by the
editors.

As for the cover,—well, here
the editors adopt the prerogative
of the Phoenix. It will be an-
nounced later. Suffice it to say
that there will be a cover.

FUTURE HUMANS
WILL EXCEL US

World Is Comparatively
Young Says Compton

I here is no reason to doubt that
our children’s children will excel us
in distinct human characteristics as
greatly as present man is in advance
of the pithecanthropus erectus, or first
true man who lived from fifty to a
hundred thousand years ago, in the
opinion of Prof. A. H. Compton, Uni-
versity physicist who last night ad-
dressed the education club on “The
New Physics and Its Relation to
Modern Life.”

"If we are occasionally troubled by
our own defects and those of man-'
kind, it is a comforting thought that
the 10,000 years of human history or
even the half million years that men
have lived on earth represents only
a small part of what will probably be
the duration of the race and we may
confidently expect a more perfect
race of men to follow.” he said.

The speaker went on to explain that
physical science gives us a basts for
belief in a friendly God. thus afford-
ing a basis for the religious beliefs
“which have been so comforting to
mankind and which have supplied us
with such valuable guides for life.”

Choose Boucher to

Talk at, Class
Banquet

Chauncey S. Boucher, associate
dean of the colleges, will speak to
the members of the junior class when
they’ assemble for their first all-class

Whether or not a reporter from The
Daily Maroon dhall be present at
meetings of the Undergraduate coun-
cil is still an undecided question ac-
cording to the report of the Board of
student exhibitions, organizations, and
publications, which sat in session Sat-
urday morning.

The question was brought up by a
student member of the Board and was
discussed by the faculty and student
representatives. Although they did not
reach a definite decision 'they did
make dear the fact that it was not
their desire that the student body in-
terpret from this that they approved
of the action taken by he council.

The general stand taken by the
Board of strident activities, organ-
izations, and publications seems to be
that they believe the question should
be one of parliamentary concern rath-
er than of the members of the Un-
dergraduate council. They believe that
student rights, or council privileges
should not be of any concern, but rath-
er that the problem is a matter of
form, of set rule.

It is probable that the question will
be again brought before the council

Seek to Interest Students
In Activities About
Campus

By Robert C. Harman

What do you do with your spare
time? Are you engaged in the act-
ivities of the University that you like
best? If not, why aren’t you?

Many students of the University
have no outlet for their spare energy
and should find associations that deal
in the fields in which they are inter-
ested. In this manner only can they’
get the most possible benefit and en-
joyment out of college life.

The

function, a dinner, which is to be
held on Thursday at 6:45 in the re-
fectory’ of Ida Noyes hall. Plans for

the affair have heen put in charge
of a committee composed of Gifford
Hitz, Esther Cook, Bradley Davies
and George Wiemer.

A number of vaudeville acts given
by campus talent will be presented
as a feature of the entertainment.
Following the program, which has
not yet been compelled, the members
of the class will dance to the synco-
pation of Bill Hahn’s orchestra.

Walter Williamson, news editor of
the Daily Maroon, has been appoint-
ed to act as toastmaster at the din-
ner. The ticket sales have been
placed in charge of Wendell Bennett.
Tickets may be secured at $1.00
from members of the class council,
who include: Leo Stone, Walter Wil-
liamson, Milton Kreines, Esther
Cook,, Joy Veagley, Ruth Daniel,
Harriet Keeney, and Bradley Davies.

publicity agents at the sessions of the
council has attracted the attention not
only of the organization ruling bodies
but of students at large. It is doubtful
whether this definite stand of the
undergraduate Council has established
a permanent precedent which will he
followed out by succeeding undergrad-
uate ruling bodies or whether future
councils will adopt a policy of giving
full publicity to their actions.

DEAN IS “UP AND
AROUND”; LEAVES
HOSPITAL FRIDAY

“Mr. Wilkins will leave the hos-
pital Friday. He has been out of
bed for the past week, walking
around and regaining ‘much of his
strength. His condition is A-l.”

This statement, made early by Dr.
Henry’ Howland James, of the Pres-
byterian hospital, constitutes the
first definite information on the re-
covery’ of Dean Earnest Hatch Wil-
kins who has been suffering for the
past month from a rundown nervous
condition. Dr. James has been in
constant attendance upon the dean,
together with Dr. Herman L. Kret-
schmer. The above decision resulted
from a consultation of the physicians
last night.

That Dean Wilkins will leave the
infirmary this week arouses the ques-
tion of whether or not he will re-
sume his University duties this quar-
ter. “We do not intend to allow Mr.
Wilkins to do any work for some
time,” declared Dr. James, in regard
to this matter. “How soon he will
undertake his scholastic affairs de-
pends on the speed of recuperation.”

Members of the dean’s family had
no further information on Mr. Wil-
kins’ condition.

DR. PATON TALKS ON
CHRISTIANITY IN INDIA

music and lyrics have been written by
some of the finest composers in the
I city.

i Tryouts for the vocal roles and for
positions in the orchestra were held
last week, and the results will be an-
nounced in an early issue of The Daily
Maroon. Try-outs are also now being
conducted to choose the special play-

I ers from the personnel of the main
I company.	.

I Persons assigned at the instruments
’try-outs will meet today at 3:30 in Ida
Noyes hall. They have been requested
to bring their instruments.

The allotment of blocks of seats to
organized groups follows a custom es-
tablished at previous dramatic enter-
tainments and since this presentation
is given by Mirror it is expected that
more of the women’s organization will
reserve sections and boxes for it than
for the other production.

I Celebrate Open
Club Week with
Valentine Party

“The Present Outlook for Christ-
ianity’ in India,” will be the subject
for a public lecture by’ Dr. William
Paton, secretary’ of the National
Christian Council of India. He will
speak tomorrow at 4:30 in Room 106
of the Theology building.

Mr. Paton, a Chirstian leader in
India, is at present on a visit to the
United States. He has been dealing
in recent years with the problems of
education and with the development
of the Indian Church. Dr. Paton
was primarily responsible for the in-
vestigation into the opium traffic
three years ago which is now result-
ihg in a change of attitude and policy
on the part of the government. His
work has brought him into contact

Chicago, will be the principal speak-
er of the afternoon. The program will
also include songs and games.

Plans for the annual Fiesta to be
held March 6 in Ida Noyes hall are
rapidly being completed, according to
Yolanda Simiz, president of the or-
ganization. Hints for decorating the
rooms in Spanish style have been fur-
nished by the Coral Gables office. Rids
for the dance will be placed on sale
after Wednesday for two dollars a
couple. The orchestra has not yet
been decided upon but it is assured
that it will be a good one. said Miss
Simiz. _

school songs to be given by the whole
club. Among numbers of a conven-
tional sort will be “The Lamp in the

by Gaines.

The club quartet, consisting of Gil-
bert W .Small, Arthur Fritsche!
Ralph Sanger, and Alan Irwin, wi’
entertain the radio audience. Irwin is
the president of the club, which is
composed wholly of students. Irwin
and Ralph Larson, ex-president, won
widespread attention last spring with
their repertory of songs, which they

athletic opportunities to every stu-
dent who takes advantage of them.
There are organizations for every
interest that a student might have.
Therefore there is no need for any
student to be idle when he might
be engaged in his favorite pastime.

At a banquet last Thursday eve-
ning, that was announced in last
week’s Maroon, the presidents of
forty-six clubs discussed the means
of getting students interested in the
various activities. This banquet was
the result of action taken by Dean
Boucher on the suggestion of Dean
Wilkins that a campaign be started
to attract students to the clubs. Their
slogan is, “Every student in .an open
club.”

This week is marked by the begin-
ning of the campaign. The clubs are
co-operating by holding special meet-
ings with programs to attract pro-
spective members. Those who are
backing this movement hope that al!
the students who are not doing all
that they might will avail themselves
of this opportunity to do so.

TRACK SIDETRACKED

UTT has come to a fine fix,” we heard an alumnus say the other

■*■ night, "when the only two teams we dare meet in dual track
meets are Purdue and Indiana. That is no more than the truth.
The yearly slipping of Chicago in track has become so fastened as
a habit on the school that it is now remarked, if at all, with indiffer-
ence. It has been nine years since Chicago won a Conference track
championship; at the present rate it may be nine more before an-
other comes to the Midway.

Mr. Stagg has been head coach in track, as well as in football,
for thirty-two years. He has had his share of success down through
those years in track, no less than in football. In the twenty-five years
since 1901, Maroon teams have won three outdoor championships,
and of the fifteen indoor meets since 1911, Stagg-coached teams
have taken another three.

In twenty-five years of outdoor Big Ten championships meets,
Chicago has taken more first places than any other school—seventy-
four; in the fifteen indoor championships, the Maroons stand second
to Illinois’s forty-five firsts with thirty-seven victories. Over the same
period of indoor Conference meets, Chicago’s 311 points also run
second to the Illini total of 451.

Certainly this past record is impressive. It was thought so by
the 1924 American Olympic committee, which selected Mr. Stagg
to coach the quarter and half-milers for the Paris meet. The record
is impressive, but it is founded on the feats of athletes of over a
generation ago; lately Michigan and Illinois have dominated Confer-
ence track athletics, and Chicago has slipped away from its standard
of bygone years. It has been nine years since Chicago has taken a
championship, and with the present lassitude that has settled over
Maroon track, it may be many more before a Chicago team repeats.

Of late years Mr. Stagg has found his duties increasingly ard-
uous, His work as director of athletics takes up much of his time;
he coaches football all fall; he is forced to spend time each year
traveling to meetings of rales committees, etc., of which he is a
member; he has found it advisable to spend a few weeks in Florida
each winter; he personally conducts a winter football class and he is
in direct charge of the month of football practice every spring. It is
only natural that he cannot devote as much as his time to the coach-
ing of track as, say, Gill at Illinois or Farrell at Michigan.

Track is a highly specialized sport; it requires constant and in-
dividual coaching for every member of the team. Mr. Stagg s wide-
spread activities make it impossible for him to put in as much work
with the team as other coaches find necessary. Chicago track con-
sequently suffers. We should advise that Mr. Stagg find a place on
the Maroon staff for a track coach who can devote all his time to
track. This would enable Mr. Stagg to limit his activities to coach-
ing football and to directing the department of athletics. We feel
that track deserves a full time coach of its own.

OHIO RELAYS BEGIN OUTDOOR SEASON

Locals Rest For Last Lap in Cage Race

MEET WISCONSIN
NEXT SATURDAY
IN RETURN TILT

Will Have Advantage Of
Home Floor This
Week End

With the last lap of the schedule
at hand, Nels Norgren worked his
men long and hard to prepare for the
invasion of the league leading Badg-
ers. A few weeks ago at Madison the
Maroons trimmed Meanwell’s sopho-
moric stars but this time although the
Maroons will have the advantage of
the home floor, the result is doubtful.
The Badgers always reach their peak
form late in the season since Mean-
well’s system is slow .but thorough.

Lose to Ohio

The Maroons are endeavoring to
overcome their glaring weakness—
shooting baskets. With the exception
of Zimmerman none of the Maroons
have shown any accuracy whatever at
the basket. It was this fault that
caused the Midwayites to receive their
fourth setback of the season when
they fell before Ohio State 18-14.
Their defense was strong indeed but
games simply cannot be won on four-
teen points. Hoerger, who was down
with the flu, and McDonough with a
twisted ankle, both played for a short
time and their absence was keenly felt
throughout the remainder of the
game. The Buckeyes, however, played
without the services of their star cen-
ter. Cookie Cunningham, who seems
to be out for the remainder of the
season.

Starting off in stellar fashion, the
Maroons rang up a 10 to 8 lead at the
half. As usual during the latter por-
tion of the tilt the Maroons wilted and
some spectacular long shots by Demp-
sey and Jeffrey won tlie game for the
Staters.

Poor Foui Shooting

Again the Maroons (ailed to take
advantage of free throws. Had the
Maroons defeated the Ohioans, they
would have had a good chance to get
a share of the Conference bunting
but as it is, only a miracle—which
means five straight wins, can get any
where near the Big Ten leaders. To
be sure, the Maroons have a few good
games left in their systems, which
seems to bode ill for some title con-
tenders.

MAROONS SUCCUMB
TO VICIOUS ATTACK
OF HAWK SPLASHERS

Finding the Hawkeyes in a too
vicious mood after taking five decis-
ive wins, the Maroon natating crew
was forced to succumb under the log-
ging count of 46 to 23. The Iowa
water artists were experts at their
trade and though the score was one-
sided, the heats were not. In fact
many of the events were so hotly
contested that it took four judges
and as many disputes to settle the
placing of the men.

McClintock is to be classed as the
fastest Hawk at the Comsters cam-
pus, taking two firsts and swimming
the relay in great shape. The sur-
prise of the evening came when
King, of the quality unknown type,
pulled a sneaker and swam his way
to first place.' Jelinek swimming for
Chicago managed to place second.

Although every event was closely
disputed the Maroons were unable to
place a first and made all their points
in running in the swimmers at the
second and third touches.

Tau Delt, Delta

Sigs Bowlers Win

Sigma Nu lost to Tau Delta Phi
in the third game of a three gam?
match while the Delta Sigs de-
feated the Chi Psis in a close
match yesterday afternoon. All
games in both matches were very
close and the scores were much
higher than in the average intra-
mural match.

After losing the first match to
the Sigma Nus on account of the
high score of 189 made by Curtin,
the Tau Delts came back and won
the next two games, the last one
by the slight margin of four
points.

The Delta Sigs did the same
with the Chi Psis, losing the first
and winning the next two. Garard
was high point man for the losers
while Howel starred for the win-
ners.

WHAT o/ IT?

^igoage MOI\CEN9TEF\N

Thursday noon I had what I
thought to be the inexpressible pleas-
ure of encountering Lonny Stagg
down in the the basement of Bartlett
gymnasium. 1 am, I inform you (if
my flippancy hasn’t given it away al-
ready), a freshman; Lonnie is fresh-
man track coach. 1 am out for fresh-
man track, for by doing that I get
out of calisthenics, club-swinging and
freshman gym work, which I detest
—Mr. Hoffer to the contrary. I
greeted young Mr. Stagg cordially;
in truth, I was glad to see him. But
he only looked back at me with what
I took to be a baleful glance.

"When,” said Lonny, “do you do
your freshman track work?” I told
him that 1 signed up on the morning
chart. “Odd,” mused Lonny, “I
have morning classes, and yet I’ve
never seen him. Odd, odd—very, very
odd.” I do not, I trust, have to carry
this painful scene farther. I am sure
that you can see Lonny was casting
aspersions on my' veracity—that, in
fact, he was doing nothing less Ilian
insinuating that my track work was
done on paper. It wounded me to see
Alonzo—my own old friend Alonzo,
mind you!—using me so. But I for-
gave him, even as—but I refer you to
Matthew 14, 4.

“Well,” ended Alonzo, “what have
you to say for yourself?” I told him
how pained I was at his treatment,
how unspeakable was my grief, but it
seemed not to affect his hard heart.
For some moments Lonny was lost
in deep thought. “I’ll tell you,” he
said finally, “there’s a novice track
meet tomorrow afternoon, and if you
don’t come out and run the 440, I shall
be forced to. take measures which I
should regret as much as you.” Here
was a frank proposition.

Thursday afternoon, accordingly, I
turned up for Alonzo’s meet. His
manner was somewhat warmer than

Divinity School Team Wins
From Hitchcock by
Large Score

Four teams played a couple of fast
games before a good sized crowd last
evening at Bartlett. The play was
between Non-Greek teams as is usual
on Monday nights. The games were
both played on the full length court,
as there were only two of them.

A Runaway

1 he first tilt of the evening was a
runaway, with the Macs taking the
lead at the start and holding the lead
right through to the finish. Only one
man, Edelman, scored for the losers
and he made all five points for In’s
team. The score was 35 to 5, in favor
of the Macs, who showed champion-
ship calibre. Anderson scintillated
for the winners with seven baskets
and a free throw and Goodman and
Kauffman made three buckets a piece.

Divinity Wins

In the only other game, Divinity
defeated Hitchcock Hall, 17-4. The
Divinity’ squad played a more pol-
ished game than their opponents.
They led at the half, 7-2 and held
the lead throughout the remainder of
the game.

SENIORS AND JUNIORS
VICTORS IN WOMEN’S

INTER-CLASS GAMES

The women’s inter-class basketball
tournament started Saturday, Feb.
6, when the Seniors won from the
Sophomores 26 to 22, and the Juniors
defeated the Freshmen by the same
score. As Miss Alma Wylie, one of
the gym instructors in charge of the
games, said, “It was a typical first-
of-the-season game, with many faults
from everybody and little outstand-
ing playing. However, there is much
promise for future development, and
the fact that the teams are so evenly
matched, as shown by the scores,
promises much lively competition.”

The next inter-class game comes
at 3:45 Feb. 17, when the Juniors
will play the Seniors and the Fiwh-
men will meet the Sophomores. By
that time there will probably be a
great advance in the playing of all
the teams.

WEEKEND WINNER

Thanks to Coach Hoffer and his I
very promising gymnasts, Chicago
did not have an entirely winless ath-
letic record over the week-end It
seems that Hoffer can always be de-
pended on to bring home the bacon
by the way he continues to chalk up
the victories, even with a swarm of
new men to work with.

This year’s outfit includes three
sophomores who promise to be con-
sistent point winners for the Ma-
roons. They helped a lot in winning
from Illinois Friday night, 1225-
1091. The men are Flexner, who
took firsts in the rings and parallel
bars, Connor who wTon the tumbling
event and took seconds in the rings
and horse, and Davidson who placed
second in both bar events. Capt.
Jerry Quin, with a first in the clubs,
a second in tumbling, and a third
in the horse, and Nelson, who won
the horse and placed third in the
parallel bars, were other point win-
ners.

Coach Merrill and his fencing
team, composed of Capt. Scarry.
Graves, Doughtery, Kerr, and Hop-
kins also journeyed to Champaign
Friday night, where they duelled Illi-

won the foil event, lost the saber,
and tied in the epee.

INITIAL MEET; NO HOME

ENGAGEMENTS CARDED ALL SEASON

Interscholastic Track Meet Will Be Feature of Home Season
in Stagg Field; Team To Travel Far
and Wide for Honors

By Jack Welty

With the outdoor track season
rapidly approaching, Coaches Tom
Eck and Lonnie Stagg are daily run-
ning the men through stiff workouts
in Bartlett Gymnasium in prepara-
tion for the coming schedule. It was
announced that the season will open
April 17 with the Ohio Relays at
Columbus. The week following at
Philadelphia, will be held one of the
classics of the season, the annual
Penn Relays, at which the cream of
the amateur talent of the country
will be in competition.

Feature of West

The Drake Relays, the middlewest-
ern feature of the year, will also be
held on this date and it is not known
at the present writing which meet
the Maroons will attend. These two
meets have always been a means of
comparing the east and west in
talent and for this reason most of
the western schools attend the Drake
Relays.

On May first the squad will go to

will take place at Columbus on May
15, and a week later the dual en-
counter with Minnesota at Minne-
polis. The conference meet will be
held at Iowa City this year on May
28th and 29th and of course will at-
tract all of the conference teams and
several outside such as Notre Dame.

will be held.

With Kernwein, star sprinter and
one of the few remaining “C” men
out at present with a pulled tendon,
the team lacks a good sprinter but is
pretty well balanced in other depart-
ments. The meet with Indiana did
not develop any phenomena on the
squad but it did bring out the fact
that the team has a fair amount of
potential ability.

in bad shape, and I shuddered to think
of those three long laps. Memories
from my high school career as a 440-
yard runner still hung over, and on
the whole they were painful. So. I did
not look forward to the race to come
with any excess of pleasure.
