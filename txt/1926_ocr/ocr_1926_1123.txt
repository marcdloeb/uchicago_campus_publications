The Wisconsin game is now past
history, and, as the boys sing, “An-
other busy season’s past, swee de la
we dum bum.” Just why there should
be any singing about the season is
something else again. Still, Saturday
night at Mr. Bloom’s and Mr. Teer-
ney’s and the College Inn and the
Thirty-fifth street taverns, one could
probably have spotted a good lot 'f
loyal Chicago men making more or
less merry alongside their Wisconsin
brothers. Why, after their teams
had been bumped off, they saw fit
to celebrate is cause for debate. It
seemed logical at the time to go out
and make sounds of revelry by night,
I am told; the night after each Wis-
consin game, it appears is the big
one of the year. This may be so.
Still grieving over the Pass That
Failed down on the four-yard line, I
hastened home to Oak Park soon af-
ter the game and while the rest of
the school was out loyally Standing
Up For Old Chicago, I was sleeping
peacefully. I hope that we at least
held Wisconsin even at the College
Inn.

• • ♦ •

I cannot recall having seen the
Maroons really keyed up' once this
season. Possibly several times they
were; still, they failed to show ex-
ternal evidences of it. There was no
running fifty yards up the field at
insane speed after coming out of the
dressing room. No, the boys seemed
entirely in control of themselves. No
rampant spirit of Do or Die for the
Old School ever shook their souls.
Their self-possession was remarkable
to anyone who had ever read one of
Mr. Wadsworth Camp’s epics of the
Gridiron—The Fourth Down, As the
Gun Went Off, A Yard to Go, or any
number of others that held me en-
tranced as a child.

Possibly Mr. Stagg did not apply
the right psychology. I wish to sug-
gest for his future use the method
Mr. Knute Rockne of South Bend is
accustomed to employ to get his No-
tre Dame team on edge. But before
starting, you must understand that
of all football players, those of No-
tre Dame are by far the cockiest.
They know they are good, and glory
in it. So, naturally, enough, every
Monday when a full column, written
by a certain unknown “Observer,”
comes out in the South Bed Times
panning the boys for fair for what
as individuals and as a team they did
or didn’t do in the game Saturday
the Notre Dame boys go into a rage
that lasts all week. And then again
Friday there appears another one of
these libels, making light of the boys
and what they’ll probably do in the
game the next day. This time the
effect upon the boys is even worse -
they froth at the mouth. Naturally
they go into the game Saturday and
do those things that Notre Dame
teams are celebrated for doing. Well
.... Rockne writes that column.

♦ * * *

Communications to this column
are so few and far between that
whenever its conductor gets one, no
matter what its nature, he lets out a
shriek and prints it. So infrequent-
ly, indeed, does he get one that he
occasionally descends to writing a
contribution purporting to be from
somebody else himself. But this sub-
terfuge rarely works: the boys al-
ways see through the dodge. The
other day, however, he did get a let-
ter, from a certain Mr. A. H. Tol-
man, calling him to account for us-
ing “like” instead of “as” as a con-
junction. “The use of ‘like’ as a
conjunction is common,” concluded
Mr. Tolman, “but not among good
writers. Mr. H. W. Fowler, in his re-
cent book, *A Dictionary of Modem
English Usage,’ says: ‘Every illiter-
ate person uses this construction
daily’.” Let me congratulate Mr. Tol-
man. That blast at the end is the
best of its kind I have ever received
—and that takes in a lot of ground.

Settlement Drive tea dances to be
held tomorrow afternoon from 4 to 6
at the Phi Kappa Sigma house. Mrs.
David H. Stevens will act as hostess.

All women are reminded of the
campus tradition of attending these
tea dances unescorted, as it is usual
for the fraternities to assemble en
masse without indivdual dates. Kath-
erine Fitzgerald, who is in charge of
the tea dances, has appointed sev-
eral girls on campus to sell these tic-
kets which may be procured for
twenty-five cents. They may be se-
cured from Marion Bloom, Violet
Holmes, Claire Davis, Rosalind
Hamm, Florence Herzman, Margaret
Newton and Eleanor Scully.

Y. W. Sewing Room
Committee To Hold

Bi-Weekly Meetings

Sewing Room committee of Y. W.
C. A. will meet on Wednesdays and
Fridays from 2:30 to 4:30 in the
sewing room on the third floor of
Ida Noyes hall. The Baby’s Friendly
Society receives the layettes which
are worked upon during these even-
ings.

This committee whicl^was former-
ly sponsored by Federation has been
taken over by the Y. W. C. A. Ida
Snyder, a member of the committee,
has been appointed to take charge
of the meetings. All those who are
interested in sewing have been in-
vited to attend the meetings.

Settlement Vodvil
Tryouts Today at 4

Settlement vaudeville tryouts
will be held Tuesday and Wednes-
day at 4 in Mandel hall. All those
who have tried out before must
be able to present their acts to-
morrow.

APPLY RULING ON
FRATERNITIES TO
WOMENS CLUBS
Active Members Must Main-
tain Average Alone, and

With Pledges to be
Eligible

Women’s club will be, beginning
this quarter, under the same scholas-
tic average system as now applies to
fraternities on the University cam-
pus, according to the decision an-
nounced yesterday by the Inter-club
council.

Adopting the suggestion of Dean
Chauncey Boucher, the twelve wom-
en’s organizations on campus will be
forced to maintain “C” averages to
be able to initiate and to retain so-
cial privileges.

ComaMib Women

As in the case of fraternities the
average must be retained by the ac-
tives alone as a group, and by the
pledges and actives together as a
group.

Dean Boucher commended the
women for voluntarily placing them-
selves under the restrictive measures
and remarked that the comparison
between men and women would be
interesting. At Big Ten schools
where sororities exist, they consist-
ently top fraternities in scholastic
averages.

K. Rose Resigns

Executive Board to fill the position
in recognition of her work in or-
ganzing Mirror.

Manuscripts for the coming Mirror
production are due at noon today.
They should be sent to Betty Gra-
ham at 5831 Kenwood avenue. Pro-
fessor Frank H. O’Hara, director of
undergraduate activities, Mr. Frank

RAISE RATES FOR
YEARBOOK SPACE

Scholz Plans Improvements
With Added Income

Twenty dollars for a page is the
price that organizations will pay for
space in the 1927 Cap and Gown.
This is an increase of five dollars
over last year’s rate. The same price,
five dollars per page, will be charg-
ed for additional space.

Richard Scholz, editor of this
year’s book, defends the increased
price. He says that the revenue will
be used to better the book. The staff
considered this to be the fairest way
of raising additional funds. A uni-
versity ruling has established a max-
imum rate of compensation, so that
it will be impossible for the staff to
profit personally by the increased
revenue.

Advise Seniors To

Check Bulletin For
List Of Graduates

All Seniors expecting to graduate
this quarter are asked to inspect the
provisional lists of candidates for the
Bachelor’s degree acording to the
University Recorder. Those who do
not find their name on any list sould
consult the officials specified not la-
ter than Dec. 1.

The lists are as follows: Colleges
of A. L. & S., on the bulletin board
of the north corridor of Cobb—Miss
Walker; Colleges of C. & A., C. & A.
building, Miss Burns; College of Ed-

PRIME DEBATERS
FOR ORAL CLASH
ON WORLD PEACE

Banquet Precedes Debate;
Plan Reception To
Follow Battle

By Dexter Masters

Today the University plays host
to its guests from the other side of
the world, the debaters from Sydney
University of Australia. And tonight
with a banquet preceding and a re-
ception following the debate, a spirit
of friendly rivalry will be added to
that of hospitality when the two
teams clash in Mandel hall.

The subject, which will find Chi-
cago on the negative side of the
question, is “Resolved that the re-
sults of the great war have tended
towards world peace.”

Reception Follows

Immediately after the debate, a
reception open to the public, is to be
held in Reynolds club with Mrs. Ed-
ward Goodspeed and Mrs. Theodore
Tieken of the English Speaking Un-
ion as hostesses, and, judging from
advance reports, it ought to be well
attended. At the banquet before the
debate, the British Vice-consul, J.
Garnett Lomax, will speak. This also
is open to the public.

All in all, it promises to be an ex-
cellent debate. The team from Syd-
ney is peculiarly well fitted to or-
atory and self-expression, with one
member, Mr. Noel McIntosh, a bar-
rister of the Supreme Court in Aus-
tralia. The leader, Mr. Sydney
Heathwood, has captained his team
for the past two years and, as a free
lance writer, has contributed to the
leading Australian journals. Upon
the completion of the present tour,
Mr. Heathwood plans to remain in
America and make a brief study of
the finance and business methods of
this country. The third member of
the invading team, Mr. John Godsall,
although deeply engaged in the study
of medicine, has become a brilliant
and practised debater and has repre-
sented Sydney for the last two years.

Gentry Captains Locals

So much for the opponents. The
team which will oppose them, rep-
resenting the University of Chicago,
presents an equally formidable as-
pect with three men of wide forensic
experience. George Gentry captained
the University of Arizona debating
team in 1926 and competed against
Oxford two years previous to that.

for the weather and term papers. It

else, it will be the best ever put on.

PROGRESS

INNOUNCEMENT has come from the office of the University ex-
aminer that the practice of giving double cuts on the Friday fol-
lowing Thanksgiving will be discontinued this year. This official
change in attitude may presage a change in the policy of the Uni-
versity in regard to class attendance. It has always seemed that the
European system of voluntary attendance at classes is highly de-
sirable in an insitution of higher learning. University training is the
final step in the formal education of a vast number of men and
women. It s advisable during the course of one’s education, to pre-
pare oneself for the independence of action which will be thrust up-
on one when engaging in the larger world outside the university.

In Europe, the plan of having the students secure their knowl-
edge in the manner which they desire and receive official credit for
their work by taking examinations at the end of the term has oper-
ated very satisfactorily for many years. This method trains the
student in making the best use of his time under the conditions met
in most of life. If the announcement by the examiner indicates a
leaning toward a voluntary attendance system, the University has

made

a progressive step and is to be commended.

FOOTBALL SEASON IS OVER.

For the University of Chicago it has been disastrous — the
in our history, we are told. The whole football world has

found choice food for comment in our 1926 football slump. Four
teams have experienced the delights of long-awaited revenge. They
have celebrated, snake danced, put on a general field day, and all
at our expense. We have been forced to quietly drown our sorrows.

It was a wearisome job to give voice to the “alma mater” for
the fifth time after the Wisconsin game. We would have much
rather been singing "Wave the Flag.” Yet, now that it is all over,
we do not know that there is any deep, black abyss in our scholastic
year. Would we really be, at the present time, a great deal happier
if we had defeated Wisconsin, Northwestern, or Illinois?

The only real bad taste we experience after an unfortunate season
is our personal contacts with men from the other universities. If
Chicago had defeated them the football subject would not arise.
Now that we are the losers we are forced to listen to long appraisals
of such and such a State’s great “line-bucking, bone-crushing ma-
chine,’’ and so on far into the night.

r This column has frequently commented on the non-import-
ance of football in the whole economy of student life. We hereby
lay ourselves open to loud guffaws and shouts of “sour grapes” on
the part of our erstwhile opponents: we do not believe that fotball
has any lasting effect on the student life in general or on the lives
of many individual students.

PSI ITS BEAT

ALPHA DELTA PHI

C. T. S. Clinches Grad League
Title With Ease

Some exceptionally fast touchball
games were played amid snowflakes
yesterday afternoon. The Psi U.’s
won their play-off with the Alpha
Delts 6-0; Kappa Sigs shoved over
two touchdowns to nose out the Phi
Gams 12-6; and Phi Sigma Delta
gave the D. U.’s a 12-0 beating.

The only score of the Psi U-Alpha
Delt game, which decided the 0-0 tie
of last week, was made in the first
minute of the second half when
George Lott intercepted an Alpha
Delt pass and threw it to Sheldon
who scored. Although Lott and Gor-
don broke away repeatedly for long
runs they were unable to cross the
goal line. Alpha Delts seemed headed
for a certain touchdown at one time
but a fumble broke the march. Pat
Kelly performed best for the losers.

Sherubel opened the scoring for
Kappa Sig by taking a lateral pass
on the kickoff and running it for a
touchdown. Crooks scored the sec-
ond touchdown for the Kappa Sigs
by receiving a short pass. The Phi
Gams made their scores after work-
ing it down the field; Schaffer finally
running it over the line. Both teams
threatened repeatedly.

The D. U. offensive was too ef-
fectively squelched by the Phi Sigs
to make the result of the game
doubtful. The Phi Sigs scored first
by receiving a punt in mid-field and
returning it with a series of short
passes for a score. Beiles scored the
second touchdown.

The Chicago Theological Semin-
ary won the graduate touchball
championship by running wild over
the Gamma Eta Gamma to the ex-
tent of 18-0. Carpenter with a run
of 40 yards; Wilcox with a 50 yard
jaunt, and a short gallop by Hall ac-
counted for the C. T. S. scoring. The
C. T. S. won all their league games
with ease.

The “Navy” slipped one over on
the “Army” yesterday and mon a
hard-fought post-season battle 7 to 0
when two Frosh elevens staged a lit-
tle warfare on the ice-covered grid-
iron of Stagg Field.

Fumbles paved the way to the lone
score. Both teams had tough sled-
ding in the heavy snow-storm and
found their early attempts in open
running plays of no avail against the
slip-shod conditions. The lines put
up a stonewall defense to smother at-
tempts at line-bucking and the game

Night at the

Navy holding the edge.

It looked like a 0 to 0 game, until

Loses Seven Men

The Maroon and Gold football
team will enter their 1927 season
without the services of seven regular
members of this year’s team. In other
words, Minnesota students and alum-
ni had their last chance to see
Captain Roger Wheeler, Bob Pep-
law, Neil Hyde, George Tuttle, Doc
Matchan, Jack O’Brien and Joe Gor-
dn perform on the gridiron last
Saturday in the Memorial stadium in
the traditional Michigan-Minnesota
clash.

Captain Wheeler, stellar-end,
Hyde, tackle, and Peplaw, one of the
speedest backs that Minnesota ever
had, are three men who have been
consistent starters on the Gopher
eleven. Matchan, O’Brien, Tuttle and
Gordon have seen in action in most
of the games this season.
