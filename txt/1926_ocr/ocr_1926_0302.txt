PLAN SELECTION
OF SENIORS AS
MIRRORUSHERS

Jeanette Hayward Acts As
Head; Broadcast Five

Lyrics Tonight

Ushers for the First Annual Mirror
will be selected exclusively from
among the senior women of the Uni-
versity. The women, whose names
will be announced in a future edition
of The Daily Maroon, will be headed
by Jeannette Hayward, secretary of
the senior class.

Set Precedent

The selection of senior women
ushers and their appearance in for-
mal costume at both performances
will establish a precedent in Univer-
sity dramatics, according to Miriam
Walker, chairman of publicity. In
observance of a recognized tradition,
only the Friday night performance
will be formal for the audience. The
production, marking as it does a not-
able achievement in campus drama-
tics, will mark one of the high lights
of this year's social season, accord-
ing to Mill Walker. Practically all
the tickets for the Friday perform-
ance have been sold, but a few are
still on sale for Saturday. These
may be obtained - at the Mandel
cloister box office, any day between
11 and 5.

Broadcast Tonight

Arrangements have been com-
pleted with station WMAQ to broad-
cast selections from the play tonight,
betwen 8:40 and 9. “Where Are We
Going," a song for which Karl Lillie
wrote the music and Mary Fassett,
the lyric will be presented by the
entire chorus of twenty-two women,
headed by Betty Dorothy Low. Lois
Russell and Joanna Downs, two of
the featured members will sing har-
mony duets. Ethelyn Seaton and Lois
Russell will lead the Wall Flower
number, which will also be broadcast.
Marie Lewis’ eleven piece string or-
chestra, composed entirely of campus
women, will play two numbers.

Women Discuss

Plan of Senior

College Clubs

Third year rushing for clubs will
be the general topic of discussion at
the open council meeting to be held
under the auspices of the Federation
of University Women tonight from 7
to 8 in the library of Ida Noyes
hall. Although the question has been
presented at meetings of the various
women’s clubs, this will be the first
occasion of its presentation to a
general gathering of University
women.

A committee composed of repre-
sentatives of the student body and
faculty, has been at work on the pro-
ject since its organization early last
fall. After mailing questionnaires to
the deans ^f some sixty colleges who
have giVen their opinions on club
rushing particularly regarding the
situation on the University campus,
the committee has presented the
third year rushing plan as the best
possible solution to the problem. Un-
der this plan no rushing may take
place during the first two years, so
that clubs would be on a senior col-
lege basis.

CAP AND GOWN ASKS I
FOR FINAL PAYMENT]

All persons who have purchased
Cap and Gown subscriptions under
the present partial payment plan of
$1.00 down are asked to bring the
remaining $3.50 to the Cap and
Gown office before March 10.

Salespersons of this past sales
drive who still have books out are
asked to return them to the office at
once.

University Prof. Forecasts Drop

In Prices During Spring Months

A slight slowing up of basic in-
dustries this spring, with an accom-
panying downward trend in prices,
seems to be indicated by the pre-
ponderance of statistical evidence,
according to Prof. Garfield V. Cox,
University economist. Analyzing
the business situation in a radio talk
last night from Station WLS, Prof.
Cox stated that industry is basically
strong, but some need for readjust-
ment is apparent.

“The sooner readjustment is made,
the better for the future of busi-
ness,” asserted the economist. “An
encouraging symptom is the increas-
ing tendency during the past month
toward lower prices for basic com-
modities, such as steel scrap, hides,
wool, silk, and rubber."

Unfavorable factors in the gen-
eral situation were listed by Prof.
Cox as declines in wholesale com-
modity prices, a marked break in the
stock market, indications that real
estate sales and new construction
have passed the peak of their boom,
a conservative tone in the automobile
industry, and a lack of increase in
farm purchasing power.

The underlying strength of the
present prosperity is indicated, how-
ever by an abundance of credit,
rapid absorption of industrial securi-
ties and foreign loans, and a wage

STRONG SPEAKS AT
NEXT CONVOCATION

PROFESSOR RIPPEY
GOES ON LEAVE OF
ABSENCE IN SPRING

J. Fred Rippey, professor of His-
tory at the University, will be out of
residence during the spring quarter,
as he will leave the campus at the
end of this quarter to spend a six
months’ leave of absence in the west.
' During this time he will teach in two
1 western universities. According to
present plans, Mr. Rippey will go di-
rectly to California, where he will
give courses in “Relations Between
United States and Latin America”
and “Latin American History.” Dur-
ing the summer quarter Mr. Rippey
will give a series of lectures on
“Latin America in World Politics”
at Colorado University.

“The months of August and Sep-
tember,” says Mr. Rippey, “I plan to
spend in Mexico studying local prob-
lems and conditions if the relations
between the United States and Mex-
ico are not too much disturbed.”

ERROR; NEW HILTON
CHAPEL NOT READY

BEFORE MARCH 16

Completion of the Hilton Chapel
that was announced in last Friday’s
Daily Maroon for March 1 will not
take place before March 16 accord-
ing to the present plan. Even this
date is not certain, but President
Davis, president of the Theological
seminary expects to have a simple
dedication exercise at this time, if
all the furnishings are completed.

The chapel, although small is one
of the most beautiful and unique
buildings on the campus. When fur-
nished, there will be in the front a
communion table and two cathedral
chairs. Six sanctuary lamps will
hang from the two sides, luminating
a beautifully carved ceiling. The
whole appearance of the interior is
devised to further inspiration.

One of the most attractive fea-
tures of the chapel is the colored
glass used to light the windows. It
is made to reproduce the finest art
of the glassmakers of the middle
ages. It is not essentially pictorial,
but representative of the finest worn
of glass in this country, painting
not on glass, but by means of glass.

The purpose of this chapel is not
for mass meetings or assemblies of
any kind, but rather for private and
individual prayer and contemplation,
as one would find in a shrine chapel
uf Old England.

Walter A. Strong, publisher of
the Chicago Daily News, will de-
liver the Convocation address on
“Newspapers and the New Age,”
at the One Hundred Fortieth con-
vocation of the University, March
16.

The convocation sermon will be
preached Sunday, March 14, in
Mandel hall, by the Rev. Harold
Edwin Balm Speight, King’s
chapel Boston.

The University will confer 268
degrees, of which 118 are bache
lor’s thirty-five master’s and
twelve doctor’s of philosophy. In
the law school seven degrees of
doctor of jurisprudence and one
of bachelor of laws will be con-
ferred. Rush medical college will
give thirty-seven degrees of doctor
of medicine and fifty-six four year
certificates.

“IMPRESSIONS OF
ORIENT’

Far East to the campus, Dr. A. W.
Palmer, of Oak Park, will speak to-
day on his personal “Impressions of
the Orient” at 4:30 in the north re-
ception hall of Ida Noyes.

The Westminister club for Presby-
terian students on campus has pro-
cured the speaker and has opened its
meeting to all members of the Uni-
versity in order that they may all
have an opportunity of hearing a
talk on the Eastern situation by a
taveller of that country.

Dr. Palmer has spent seven years
in Hawaii, China, and Japan, and in
that time has been able to form de-
finite impressions of those countries
in the social, religious, and political
fields.

Before the lecture, and while the
guests are coming, a short social
meeting will be held. This will give
the guests time to get acquainted

Time Affects

Dramas— Wilt’s

Class to Prove

By Vedder J.

At exactly 4:46 yesterday afternoon.)
the peace and quiet of The Daily Ma-
roon office was disturbed by a loud
and insistent ring from the telephone.
The news editor rushed to the instru-
ment immediately and was greeted
with a soft feminine voice from the
opposite end of the line. It said: “Send
your best reporter over to Cobh 110 at
once. There is a big story.”

The newsed hoping that perhaps
Cobb hall had at last caught fire, sent
his last Sophomore. But what should
the reporter find instead of a fire, but
a rehearsal of the play to be given by
Mr. Wilt’s class in English drama,
and what should greet his ear but the
phrase “Is she my wife?” spoken in
absolute sincerely by Leo Stone!

Well, here’s the idea. This play,
which is entitled “’rhe Stranger” and
is being directed by Ralph J. Helllem.
is one written in the year 1787 for
production to an English audience of
that period. There was much talk in
those days of not allowing the play to
be presented because of the subjec’
which it treats. When the play was
finally presented, it made the audience
weep and ring their hands.

TARPON ANNOUNCES

ELECTION RESULTS

Harriet Ray, prominent in wo-
men’s athletics, will lead the swim-
ming club next year. Miss Ray was
elected president of Tarpon club at
the annual elections held - last Fri-
day in the foyer of Ida Noyes hall.

Helen Chelsea was chosen vice
president, and Cora Louise Tabetts
was elected secretary treasurer. The
new officers will be installed at a
dinner to be held Thursday at 6 fol-
lowing the Inter-class swimming
meet in Ida Noyes hall.

ANNOUNCE OPENING
OF READING ROOM

An opportunity to study the
works of Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy
is offered in the new study room
opened yesterday in Theology 205
by the Christian Science Society.
The reading room is to be open
between 12 and 1 from Monday
to Friday inclusive.

Christian Science literature will
be available for study by the
Christian Science students who
wish to take advantage of this op-
portunity. According to Mabel
Luecke, chairman of the study
room committee, the plan has been
worked out to fit the definite need
of bringing to the Christian Sci-
ence student this valuable litera-*
ture. Christian Scientists who do
not belong to the club have been
urged to use the study room as
well as members, and to attend
^he bi-weekly meetings held by
the society.

There will be a meeting of the
club tonight at 7:30 in the north
reception room of Ida Noyes hall.

FRIARS SCRIPTS

BEFOREJUDGES

Final Selection Made in Near
Future

Scenarios submitted in the competi-
tion for the 1926 Blackfrairs produc-
tion are now before the judges. The
final selection will be made within the
next few weeks.

Four books have been submitted.
Their authors are James Root and
Robert Jackson; G. William Rager
and Walker Davis; Fred. Handschy
and Walter G. Williamson; and two
annonymous writers. These four
books will be judged by a committee
composed of Profs. Woodward, Linn,
Boynton and Nelson, who will select
what in their opinion are the two best
manuscripts. The final selection will
be made by Hamilton Coleman, for
eight years the director of the Black-
friars performances.

Coleman, who has read all of the
manuscripts, declares that all of them
are good and predicts that the judges
will have a great deal of trouble in
selecting the best manuscript. Paul
Cullom, abbott of Blackfrairs predicts
that with a good book to work with
and the amount of enthusiasm that has
thus far been manifested toward this
year's performances, the annual per-
formance should be well worth going
to see.

FORECAST OF MEN’S
FASHIONS GOES ON
BOARDS THURSDAY

What styles in men’s clothing will
be in the spring, what shades and
color schemes are in demand will be
shown at the annual style show con-
ducted by Y. M. C. A. Thursday,
March 4 at 4 in the theater of the
Reynolds club house.

The Daly, Huston, and Selecman
company, will conduct the demon-
stration showing models of the Kup-
penheimer clothiers, as well as their
own.

Vaudeville acts, a jazz orchestra,
smokes, and refreshments complete
the plans for this last social func-
tion for the quarter conducted by
the Y. M. C. A. It is to take the
place of the regular open house
which has been held each week in
the south lounge with the idea of
promoting fellowship among the men
of the University.

A talk on the effect of styles on
students and of students on styles,
is expected to accompany the show-
ing of the models. The entertainers
will be drawn from campus talent
and from city amusements.

“The style show is an annual
event in the Y. M. C. A.’s social
progam," said Tom Paul, president.
“It should prove of interest to the
University men to see what the
clothiers have prepared for them.”

SANTA CLAUS, ’26

OENIORS, the rules of the game require, give the University a pre-
'^ sent. Seniors always have. A senior gift, like the senior moust-
ache race and the privilege of going to class ten minutes late, is a
part of the machinery that makes a senior. Without these things,
we should be without seniors.

A puzzle arises. The class gift is not like other senior tradi-
tions; it demands originality. The same moustache race can be held
for decades at a stretch; but the same gift can not be given twice.
The Botany pond is only big enough for one bridge; there is no third

entrance to Harper reading-room, over which a third clock might
hang; students in front of Cobb are as misled as students can be—|
another erratic timepiece could not confuse them further; and as for J
senior benches, we haven’t a place even for the old one. The class
of 1926 must think of a gift that former classes have passed over.

Somebody suggested insurance policies. Let every senior pay
$12 a year as premium; in twenty years let the University receive
$500 from each policy. The seniors rejected the proposal, perhaps
because the figures were too high, perhaps because the proposition
($12 a year, regardless of circumstances) was too hidebound.

The question remains. Shall the seniors give money (though in
more reasonable amounts, and on more humane terms) to the De- ;
velopment campaign? Or shall they find another place to hang a
clock? Or shall they erect a Fountain of Time at the entrance to '
E-11?

These questions are not rheorical. They demand an answer; and
you, senior reader, to whom we address them, must answer them. ■
Write your idea, sign your name, or that of a friend, and send it to ।

affair.

REFLECTIONS

A /TlRROR, the all-women’s branch of the Dramatic association, !
makes its debut on campus Friday night, with a reflective pic- [
ture of the college girl asking, “Where Are We Going?’’ Rivalling
any social event of the year at the University, it opens entirely new I
possibilities for dramatic achievement.

The Mirror venture is new, and any new venture deserves com-
mendation and praise. New ventures are none too frequent. The
women are taking it upon themselves to produce a play that will be
truly symbolic of the college girl. Time and effort have been ex-
pended in order that the production may be worthy of its purpose
and its name. The members of the organization realize that they
are setting a precedent, and they declare that the maiden perform-
ance of Mirror will be a recognizable tradition for future regimes to
follow.

Campus support is solicited. After all, the production of
Mirror is by the campus, of the campus, and for the campus. If you,
like the college girl in the play, are wondering what college is all
about, attend the performance, and learn “Where Are We Going?’’

CLUBS IN SENIOR COLLEGE

SHALL we have Senior College clubs? Last fall a committee of
faculty and students was appointed to consider the club situa-
tion. Such a plan is followed at Harvard and at Princeton, and is
found to be effective.

Under this system, there would be a blanket ruling providing
against all rushing during the first two years of residence, and pledg-
ing would take place during the first week of the Junior year. By
this time associations and friendships are formed, and women can
be more sure of the connections which they want to form.

Under the present system, club women do not make some of |
the friends they would have if they were not bound by a club; non- j
club women miss the friendships they might have formed with club
women. Freshmen often get an inferiority complex because they
have not been pledged. It may be due merely to an oversight, be-
cause club women did not happen to meet these freshmen; they may |
never have been considered because they were not known; but they
feel slighted, they think they are not good enough, and they start
out their college careers with a handicap.

Women who would be unknown in activities if left to them-
selves may now play prominent parts because they have the backing
of a club. This would be eliminated under the proposed plan, and
a woman would stand on her own feet during her first two years on
campus. On the other hand, the duration of club life would be cut
in two.

The Open Clubs

This is the first of a group of seven
lists which will be published in The
Daily Maroon to bring the open clubs
into contact with such students as
need them for an outlet of expression
by making the activities of the open
clubs known.

ingly tight defensive game and keep-
ing the ball in their possession the
majority of the time the Sigma Nus
showed some teamwork that stamps
them as one of the best teams in the
tourney. The losers failed to play up
to the form which enabled them to run
over the Phi Gams, one of the favor-
ites, Friday night. Hoey with his
clever floorwork and brilliant shoot-
ing was the star of the game but
Koerber with his two sensational field
goals was also an outstanding man'.
Gr^y the star of the Delta Sigs was
held out of the game the first half
and he-was guarded too closely after
his entrance in to the encounter to
have any bearing on the result al-
though he did sink one beautiful shot

point man for the losers by virtue of
his three field goals.

Casle Stars

With Casle leading the attack Alpha
Tau Omega beat Delta Tan Delta in
probably the fastest game of the tour-
namen. Casle was the big star of the
evening making 10 points and cover-
ing the floor in a stellar style. Gor-
don, star forward for the winners, was
held to one basket by the spectacular
guarding of Rouse. Anderson's three
long shots and Murphy’s guarding
featured the encounter. Bowman,
lanky center, for the Delts, was the
star of his team with these field goals
from under the basket. O’Keefe also
played a great game at guard.

With Gray playing the leading role
Delta Sig Phi upset the Phi Gams Fri-
day night in the biggest upset thus
far by a score of 29 to 9. The high
scoring Phi Gam aggregation was held
to three baskets by the close guard-
ing. Delta Sig team while Ferris and
Gaskill went on a scoring rampage.

Announce Officials for Carnival; Over Thirty to Aid In

MURCHISON AND

OTHERS COMPETE

Another special event has been
added to the long list of features
which the Intramural department
has planned to add interest and pres
tige to the Second Annual Indoor
Athletic Carnival to be started this
afternoon and completed Thursday.
Bob Winfrey, stellar dash man who
won all of his heats in the 1924
Stagg Interscholastic to win the cen-
tury event, is to run an exhibition
50 yard dash against two I. A. C.
luminaries, Loren Murchison and
Cyrial Coaffee.

Winfrey, who hails from Fayette
High School, of Somerville, Tenn.,
is coming to compete in the national
track meet to be held in the city
next Saturday. Only two weeks ago
he defeated Charley Paddock, re-
nowned as the world’s fastest human,
in a race at Memphis, Tenn. He is
a friend of Burke, the star miler on
the Maroon Frosh team, and may
come here to school. Burke secured
him for the exhibition race.

Murchison and Coaffee make any
track meet worth attending. Their
prowess has been demonstrated time

By their win over the
the Juniors strengthened
to the title.

They now hold a record of three
wins and one tie: the Seniors are next
with three wins and one loss; the
Sophomores follow with one win. one
tie, and two losses; and the Freshmen
are last with four defeats. However,
in spite of their unbroken record of
losses, the Freshmen have an unusual-
ly good line-up this year and have
managed to give a good account of
themselves in almost every game.

The next games will be played off
Wednesday, March 3, at 3:45 p. m.,
when the Juniors and Seniors will
clash and the Sophomores will meet
the Freshmen.

chison has been proclaimed as the
world’s champion sprinter, and Coaf-
fee has run the 100 yard dash in nine
and three-fifths.

This feature event was too entic-
ing a one to leave off the Carnival
program, even at this late hour, and
the Intramural department was very
fortunate in securing it. Together
with the swarm of other specialties
which have been added from time to
time, it will make the gorgeous ath-
letic revue go down in history as
something to always remember when
thinking of Intramural accomplish-
ments.

Nobody will want to miss the finals
Thursday evening, when all of the
attractions take place. With the Uni-
versity Band, a Charleston exhibi-
tion, a song fest, fencing and wrest-
ling contests, special races between
championship runners, and a host of
surprise stunts on the bill no one
will miss it.

PURDUE TANKMEN

Mac Gillvray's swim team emerged
from its long lethargy on Saturday
evening and so surprised the Purdue
tankers that the score came out lop-
sided with Chicago’s total on the heavy
,cnd; Purdue had a few individual stars
who managed to take four of the first
places but everyone on the Chicago
team was at bis best and the seven
firsts and the numerous seconds and
thirds which they grabbed off com-
pletely swamped the enemy tankers
by the score of 46 to 23.

Chicago took all of the short swims
with the exception of the 100 yard
event but came in behind in the longer
distances. The Purdue men seemed
to have the edge when it came to a
test of endurance and last lap spurts.
The relay wins were evenly divided,
the locals taking the 160 yard sprint
while the invaders won the 300 yard
medley. The last race was close to
the “Nth” degree with victory being
finally awarded to the Boilermaker
team on the basis of a Maroon dis-
qualification.

Diamond and Mygdall opened the
evening’s activities auspiciously with
a respective first and second to their

credit.

to themselves.

Noyes lived up to his repu-
one of the fastest splashers

in the conference and came through
with a clean win in the 40 yard event,
but Lane and Greenburg who were
doped to finish in the lead in the 440
dash had to be content to conic trailing
after Davenport. The high point
honors of the meet were carried back
to Purdue by Leichtle who took first
in the back stroke and third in the
fancy diving events.

Expect Many Thrills

1 here will be no preliminaries for
the Graduate relay races, all of which
will be held on Thursday at 8:15. in
conjunction with the finals of the Un-
dergraduate races. As in last year’s
carnival, these races are expected to
afford some of the most thrilling and
closely contested competition in the
I1M events. Each team includes four
men, each of whom will run two laps.
Two teams will run at a time, one on
each side of the track, running against
time rather than against each other.
The four teams making the best time
will* qualify for Thursday’s finals.

squad last Saturday evening and de-

by the overwhelming score of 8 to 1.
The locals led throughout the fray
and at no time did the Purdueites

MARY HEARS THE
LIBRARY BOOKS IN

QUERULOUS MOOD

By Mary Winner Hughes

It was after hours, and the books
were holding an indignation meeting.
We,slipped into a corner seat, won-
dering what they would say. A batter-
ed copy of "Jurgen” took the floor.

"Look at me!” he sighed. "Only
eleven months old, and in my second
childhood, since I’ve been to the bind-
ery once, and am headed for the waste
basket now. I need a rest cure.”

“I’m worse off than you!” “Renais-
sance and Reformation,” protested,
"for the first time I went out into cir-
culation I was covered with history
notes in lieu of a forgotten note book.
It’s a terrible thing to go through life
with a disfigured countenance!”

"Tristam Shandy,” limped up .“I’m
a wreck!” he groaned. “Three of my
pages ripped out for greater conveni-
ence in carrying, and two more, slits
across. Oh! Oh!”

“I suppose I’m lucky,” ventured
"Ulysses,” "I only got dropped in the
snow once.”

‘The Perennial Bachellor” shivered.
"My cover is so pretty and shiney
now, I hate to think of the future!”

“ ’Sfunny” the Latin Dictionary
mused, “Folks don’t realize that every
time one of us is mutilated, they are
really hurting themselves, because we
necessary textbooks must be re-
placed, and the newer volumes have
