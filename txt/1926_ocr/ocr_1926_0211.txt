McLaughlin of the University history
department explained how the ma-

“Admitting then and indeed em-

parties, this one still must see: that
thg compelling force is general public
opinion, which somehow manages to
make itself felt,” Prof. McLaughlin
asserted. “You and 1 may not be

Prof. Frederick C. Woodward,

newly appointed Vice-President of the
University said that quality should be
stressed by the University. “Students
have crowded into universities in re-

providing room and instructors. There
has been ton much quantity and not
enough quality.

“We have one *'f the best under-

the underworld, the thief removed a
pocket book from the pocket of a fur
coat of reputed value passing the
racoon by to take chances of finding
a Prom ticket in the hip pocket of
somebody’s trousers.

“This should serve as a warning to
other fraternities,” said Allison last
night. “Even if the brothers have
lost their keys it is better to wake,

PROFS. RIPPEY AND

Various aspects of the Pan-Ameri-

J. bred Rippey, associate professor of
history and Jacob Viner professor of
political economy when they address
the conference on “Our Relations with

Miss Dorothy
a student in the

La-

Art

the University has

made the interesting experiment of
drawing herself as she feels on dif-
ferent days.

According to Miss 'LaSalle, ev-
eryone is affected by his surround-
ings; his moods and his thoughts
take on the color of his environ-
ment; he even looks like the things
around him. To demonstrate her
theory, Miss LaSalle has loaned the

“Studies—Mostly of Herself.”

Just for example, as Miss La-
Salle sat on the shores of Lake

Superior one summer

she

sketched herself, and was surprised
to find that the finished water color

contained the

erev of the

clouds and the dull mue of the
lake. A slightly drooping head
against a solemn indigo back-
ground leaves no doubt that the
model is sad, while the head next
to this in black and white with the
twinkling eves tells, a different tale.

These are just a few of Miss La-
Salle’s moods, for she seems to be
a creature of delightful color. And
so we suggest that you drop in
the office of the Art Department
in the Classics building and make
Miss LaSalle’s acquaintance for
yourself.

Fortunately disciplinary measures of this sort are
rare, at least in a form so extreme. President Lowell
has observed that the prime object of the modern college
is to stimulate desire for intellectual attainment. It is
coining o be a truism that this stimulation can only
be achieved by the instructor who abandons the old-

AN OUTLET

Campus clubs meeting this week have planned their
gatherings with the open club program now in effect.
This program has been planned, not to give the students
something more to do. nor to make one more demand on
an already crowded program, but to provide an outlet
for excess energy, and to link up classroom activity with
social life.

The language and other departmental clubs accomp-
lish the latter purpose. At their meetings topics of real
interest are presented which would never come up in
the average class, and thus the student can increase not
only his social but his intellectual experiences. It’s worth
trying, if time is heavy on your hands, and you aren’t
already a member of one or more of these organizations.

PLAYING THE PEDAGOGUE

(From The Harvard Crimson)

The theory, long, deep-rooted in American education,
that discipline for its own sake holds a legitimate place
in the college curriculum, crops out repeatedly in discus-
sions of university policy. Recent press comments have
viewed with considerable deprecation new departures at
several institutions concerning attendance at classes. Sim-
ilar changes have likewise raised the hue and cry that
discipline must not be sacrificed.

This view of college education, the historical prece-
dents of which are far more ample than the contemporary,
finds not infrequent reflection in the conduct of Univer-
sity Courses. The Harvard tradition has always been
toward strengthening individual Responsibility, toward
relaxing and discarding those petty regulations which are
always ineffective with lethargic students, and often un-
just to others. The whole trend of policy is liberal; there
nevertheless remain instances to the contrary to empha-
size by contrast the main current.

An illustration of this false standard has just come
to light in connection with one of the literature courses
open to graduates and undergraduates. A list of subjects
for long reports was submitted to the members of the
course, who were given an option on their choice of
subject with the understanding that for those who did not
exercise this option an arbitrary assignment would be
made. One Senior, not choosing his own subject, was
assigned one by number, he-wrote upon the wrong sub-
ject. In punishment for this mechanical slip, the student
in question was given the arbitrary mark of E on his
thesis, with the explanation that the instructor was mak-
ing an example of him for his carelessness in following
instructions. Granting without question the prerogative
of the instructor to use whatever disciplinary devices
he deems necessary to the mechanical requirements of
the course, such primitive treatment smacks unpleasantly

VOX POP I

To The Editor:

I fear that your report of the consideration given
by the Board of Student Organizations, Publications and
Exhibitions to the question as to “whether or hot a
reporter from the Daily Maroon shall be present at the
meetings of the Undergraduate Council” gives an en-
tirely wrong impression. The question was brought be-
fore the Board in a very informal manner and neither the
Board nor inidividual members of the Board expressed
either approval or disapproval of the action taken by the
Undergraduate Students Council. The only specific sug-
gestion made was that the members of the Council might
profit by calling the question to the attention of author-
ities on parliamentary procedure.	o

To emphasize the growing sensitive-
ness of party politics to fluctuations in
the political weather, Prof. McLaugh-

Eugene V. Debs will be the speak-
er at a meetir g of the Liberal club,
Wednesday, Feb. 24, at 8 in Harper
Ml5 and will talk on “Peace Through
Socialism.’’

The Liberal club sponsors three
and sometimes four lectures and dis-
cussion groups a week, usually upon
the subject of peace.

Many other noted lecturers are
upon the club program. On Feb. 17,
Miss Jane Addams, well known for
her work at Hull house will speak on
“The Coming Peace.”

On Tuesday, Feb. 16, Mr. Stanley
High, author of “The Challenge of
Youth” ha” agreed to sneak on

“Peace Through Religious Educa-

Who is the Maroon faculty advisor?
If we’re standing out against the
procedure of other Boards . . . that
is, if they allow reporters, then we
should.

It’s political ethics anyway you look
at it. Do you know of any legislative
body that bars Maroon publicity?

It’s silly to make an issue out of it.
The thing to do is to find out about
the other organizations, and then

compromise.

I object to yellow sheet stuff. Why
give it to them?

We’ll take all the fire out of their
guns. They’re hurting the entire

I think we need open meetings.

The University officials won’t open
the council for the campus.

I still think we might as well let
everyone hear what we have to say.

Camels represent the utmost in cigarette quality. The

Camels by master blenders and the finest of French cigarette
paper is made especially for them. Into this one brand is
concentrated all of the knowledge, all of the skill of the
worlds largest organization of expert tobacco men.

WHEN the dark skies are
pouring rain outside.
And fickle fate deals you
hands at bridge that you
play with consummate
skill—here a Camel!

For Camel is the silent
partner that helps every
deserving player win his
game. Camels never hurt
or tire the taste, never
leave a trace of cigaretty
after-taste. Regardless of
the gold you spend,
you’ll never get choicer
tobaccos than those
rolled into Camels.

So this evening as you

Faris asserted. There is no record
in all the literature of the lynching
of a man by a mob of Quakers, he
pointed out.

Explain* Flirtation*

The speaker continued, “Young
men who indulge in street corner
flirtations are sometimes successful
in their unconventional advances,
but when this is true we are doubt-
less justified in assuming the pre-
existing tendency on the part of the
picked-up flapper and the advance
is not always successful. To attempt
a flirtation may be to arouse im-
patience or anger or disgust in which
case there seems to be no possibility
of assuming an interest of imitation
at all. Courtship would be fairly
easy and smooth-running if every
emotion were promptly imitated
when expressed.

“The point is still further made
clear if we consider these numerous
cases in which the emotion observed
gives rise to a very different one.
It is hard to witness the sudden fall
on an icy sidewalk of a well nourish-
ed gentleman without being amused.
And it is easy to observe that the
corpulent being in question neither
communicates his emotion to the be-
holders nor imitates their own feel-
ing toward himself. He may be
angry or embarrassed, but if he
laughs it always seems to be forced.

Di*cua*e* Fad*

“A well-taught and conservative
young woman on seeing nude color-
ed stockings, visible garters and bare
knees is more likely than not to be
confirmed in her own good taste.

“Not all women bob their hair
even yet and for many months the
practice made headway slowly. There
are doubtless many women who will
never ait in a barber chair but will
continue their former manner of
wearing their hair in spite of' the
wide diffusion of the custom. And
the reason is not difficult to state.
Their own conservatism or their
ideals of fitness or beauty do not
accord with the practice or else their
ambitions to win the praise of the
group involved are limited or even
non-existent. The girl who dresses
in extreme customs is indeed imitat-

deeper than the mere perception of

Eek’s Men Have Slight Edge Over Purdue

BOTH SQUADS HAVE
BEATEN INDIANA BY

THE SAME SCORE

Hoosier# Conceded Shot
and Dashes, Locals

Strong

If the Purdue track team’s handy
defeat of Indiana means anything
Tom Eek’s boardmen will have to
plunk the Bartlett track a little more
industriously and frequently than in
the past in order to emerge with
floating colors from their dual meet
with the Boilermaners tomorrow
night.

The Maroons presented Indiana
with a 58-28 reversal while Purdue
was not at all backward and also
chipped in by giving their fellow
Hoosiers a 57-28 licking. Note-
worthy in this latter slaughter was
the defeat of Pepper, the crack dash-
man who led the way for the Maroon
sprinters, by Sebold of Purdue who
negotiated the 40 yards in 4 4-5 sec-
onds. Miller and Fox should worry
Berg considerably in the pole vault
as these lads both cleared the bar at
11 feet.

Jones of the invaders has been
heaving the shot over 40 feet re-
gularly during practice drills and this
distance is good enough for first
place tomorrow night. However the
Maroons’ strength lies in the middle
distance runs. Captain Cusack will
only receive mediocre competition in
the 880 and mile from Little of Pur-
due who is only an ordinary per-
former. Armstrong has been run-
ning the quarter mile some seconds
under the best time made by Spencer
of the visitors. Spencer was able to
only place third in the Indiana meet-
ing.

The Purdue relay quartet is com-
posed of Sebold, Eagen, Spencer and
Harmon. They depend upon Sebold
to get a good start which they at-
tempt to maintain.

Postpone I-M Ice

Meet Indefinitely

Owing to the heavy fall of snow
which settled itself over the Mid-
way rinks Tuesday night the in-
tramural department was again
forced to postpone the ice car-
nival which was to be held yes-
terday afternoon. No definite
date was set on which to run off
the contests but it was announced
that it would be next week some-
time, the exact day of which will
be announced in the Maroon.

In the past there have been sev-
eral postponements due to the
gentle breezes that have been
wafting up from the southland.
According to Doc Molander, In-
tramural advisor, the department
is rapidly tiring of the eternal bat-
tle with the weather man, and is
dehating the advisability of leav-
ing the field to old Jed.

I thumbed over The American Ox-
onian, The Anthropological Monthly,
Eye, Ear. Nose and Throat Journal,
Survey and The American Magazine,
but there was nothing in any of them
that was calculated to arouse my
jaded appetite. At last I hit on The
American Mercury. “Here,” 1
thought, “is entertainment. I shall
spend a half hour with the great
minds of the age.”

I went down the table of contents
in search of the choicest morsel in
the whole offering. I struck op what
I thought it to be: “The Baptists.”
it was headed, by James Gerard. I
turned to the article. Imagine my
surprise when, instead of seeing a
nice, meaty article, my horrified gaze
fell upon only a mutilated group of
page stubs, neatly cut off close *o
the binding. The article had been
clipped!

Here, indeed, was to-do Was all
our vaunted boasting of American
free speech and freedom of the pres<
merely empty talk? Was the Con-
stitution so much ballyhoo? Did our
forefathers (those, that is, of some
of us) die or sign their names n
vain? Was the Reynolds club (that
stronghold of ultra-democracy!) to
have its free spirit crushed in the
clutch of official tyranny? All the'e
thoughts surged through my brain
as I stood there, dumbly gazing on
the mutilated Mercury.

But a broader view soon came to
me of the matter. The University

PING PONG AT W.S.C.

Will Ping Pong take its place
along side of college sports?

At Washington State College the
Y. M. C. A. conducted a tournament
this week that marks a milepost in
the history of the game. It is the
first time in the annals of American
college sports that such an event took
place.

Whether this much maligned sport
is to rise from its lowly state, the
jest of all sports, and assert itself, is
a matter that will be watched with
interest.

PRIME TANK MEN
FOR INITIAL WIN
IN GOPHER MEET

MacGillivray*# Men Favored
In Water Polo

Game

Coach MacGillivray is taking his
crew to Minnesota this week with
hopes of bringing back two victories,
swimming and polo. This is the
third trip for the Maroon team this
year and will be the longest one of
the season.

Minnesota boasts of a number of
fast men and have confidence of
sending the local natators back to
Chicago reading an unsavory score
sheet. The Hill brothers are still on
a rampage up north and are con-
sidered the fastest in both the dashes
and backstroke evens, while Moody
is splashing the hundred yard crawl.

Captain Richter, one of last year’s
speed merchants is still repeating his
former performances and will fur-
nish keen competition for Ed. Noyes i
and Harry Rittenhouse.

Fancy Diving Will Be Claxsy

In the line of fancy diving Fortier
will defend the hosting team against
the invasion of Fellinger and Wilder.
Fortier was classed at one of the
highest rungs of the fancy diving
ladder of last season as well as two
years back. His experience is greater
than that of the local Kellerman but
experience isn’t everything!

K. Mygdal is apt to have things
his own way for Minnesota does not
show promise of strength in the
breastroke events but with the great
number of sophomore breastroke
buds a surprise will he looked for.

Captain Petrolowitz and his polo
squad have as yet not been outclass-
ed this year although they have been
outpointed. The poloers are going
up with the intentions of both out-
classing and outscoring the hostile
crew once and for all.

DELTA SIGS GAIN IN
I-M PARTICIPATION

POINTS FOR SEASON

An announcement by the Intra-
mural office yesterday changed the
status of the leading fraternity point-
geWers as announced by them previ-
ously through the sport page of the
Maroon. As printed the three leaders
were Kappa Sigma with a 196 points.
Phi Gamma Delta, 175, and Delta Sig-
ma Phi, 166 1-2. The result of close
investigation revealed that the stand-
ing should be Kappa Sigma 196, Delta
Sigma Phi*. 1821-2, and Phi Gamma
Delta 175.

Through undeserved forfeits and
because of the omission of some points
garnered during the swimming car-
nival the Delta Sigma Phi wa? not
credited with the 16 points which they
merited. This revision boosted the
Delta Sigs above the Phi Gams in the
autumn sport standings.

Relay To Count

The Intramural staff will hold a
meeting to determine whether the re-
lay event held during the swimming
meet will be or will not be considered
in the granting of points. The result
of this decision will also affect the
positions of the leaders. Tn the car-
nival Kappa Sigma was first with 26
counters, while Phi Kappa Sigma with
15 and Delta Sigma Phi with 11 fol-
lowed.

Schedule Ten I-M
Basketball Games

Ten I-M cage games are sched-
uled for tonight. Three leading
teams will swing into action, the
Delta Sigs playing the Tekes, the
Delts meeting the Delta Chis and
the Phi Gams matching eyes with
the Phi Delts. A complete sched-
ule follows:

ILLINI RELAYS TO

FEATURE SPEED

Speed, not only on the track, but
in the running off of the meet will
be a feature of the University of Illi-
nois relay carnival, the country’s larg-
est indoor track event, scheduled for
Saturday, Feb. 27, in the big Illinois
armory.

The main meet will be Saturday
night on a time schedule of two hours,
starting at 7:30 and closing at 9:30.
The Illini managers believe that the
public will respond to this program.
Year after year the Illini have been
cutting down on the time of the big
meet and this year’s innovation is the
culmination of these efforts.

“We are cutting down our main
meet at night to two hours. Our at-
tendance has always been good, but
we believe that people will enjoy track
meets more if they do not last too
long.” says Harry Gill. Illinois track
coach.

The .Saturday night program will
be featured by the university races—
the mile, two mile, medley and four
mile relays in which the best runners
of the Big Ten, Missouri Valley and
other institutions will struggle for su-
premacy. Fast fields also will com-
pete in these special events: 75-yards
dash: 75-yards low and high hurdles;
300-yards, 1000-yards and 1500-meter
runs; high and broad jumps; shot put;
pole vault.

VICTROLA USED TO

PEP UP DUMBELLS

If you happen to be one of the
physical culturers who occupies the
main floor dressing room of Bart-
lett gym around three o’clock every
afternoon you probably noticed the
portable victrola setting in the cage
where you exchange your old towels
for the new. ' You probably won-
dered what it was all about, and
thought they were going to add
Charleston contests to the Intra-
mural program or make them a new
P. C. credit. You were wrong.

About four o’clock Coach Hoffer
of the Gym Team arrived on the
scene, took the “vic,” put on a rec-
ord, but it wasn’t Charleston music.
Captain Jerry Quinn began twirling
the clubs, or the dumbells as you call
them, and he thinks the music will
help him a lot in getting the rythm
necessary to perform in real cham-
pionship manner.

CHICAGO VICTORY WOULD FURTHER
COMPUCATE TITLE RACE; WISCONSIN,
INDIANA AND OHIO NOW LEAD HELD

Ineligible Men Further
Complicate Title

Race

By Jack Welty

With one of the most hectic cage
races of recent years in progress dope-
sters are busily engaged in attempt-
ing to pick a championship aggrega-
tion. No team has a clean slate and
practically every aggregation with the
possible exceptions of Northwestern
and Minnesota have a remote chance
of sporting the little gold basketballs
on their watch charms.

Wisconsin at the present looks like
one of the best teams in the race and
if they can down the Maroons Satur-
day night, the only team that has
previously defeated them they will
have an excellent chance of copping
the bunting. Indiana is another strong
aggregation and with Sponsler. Reek-
tier. Krueger. Sibley and Winston go-
ing strong the team presents one of
the ’ strongest offenses in the race
but is handicapped by a very medi-
ocre defense.

Purdue as the Midway fans already
know has a team that is hard to beat
and a lot depends on the tilt with Il-
linois on the latter’s floor. Michigan
rated as a powerful team, suffered a
great blow this week when it was an-
nounced that “Bo” Molenda, the sen-
sational sophomore, and Cherry a fine
guard of three years’ standing had
been declared ineligible because of
scholastic difficulties. The Northwes-
tern squad was also hit when “Moon”
Baker, speedy forward and captain of
the Purple football team had been
ruled out for a semester until he could
make up a certain delinquent subjeet.

The showing of the Ohio Team has
been one of the surprises of the cur-
rent season. After losing the majority
of last year’s championship team by
graduation and also Cunningham the
team has come back strong and is a
dangerous contender for the title.

To Award All I-M Trophies at
Second Annual Athletic Carnival

Extensive plans for a gorgeous
event were laid out by the Intra
mural department, when they met
late yesterday* afternoon to arrange
for their Second Annual Indoor
Athletic Carnival. This affair clim-
axes the huge winter program of in-
door sports and is one of the out-
standing events on the campus.

Arnold Johnson, one of the sopho-
more managers, has been selected to
run the carnival this year. He has
several committees to work with
him. Together they will make pre-
parations for the biggest undertak-
ing in the history of the Intramurai
department.

Preliminaries are to be held on
Tuesday, March 2, beginning at 4
o’clock sharp. Finals will be held on
the evening of Thursday, March 4,
starting at 7 p. m. The events are
to be the 50 yard dash, 50 yard low ;
hurdles, 300 yard run, 600 yard run,
one mile run, high jump, shot put,
pole vault and a four man relay In
which each man runs two laps.

Specialties will add greatly to this
year’s program. Ted Cante, nation-
ally known announcer of Stagg In-
terscholastic and Intercollegiate
fame, has been engaged for the final
evening. The University Band is to

Badgers Are Favorites
In Saturday*#
Tilt

By Irving Goodman

After a fast scrimmage with Fritz
Crisler’s yearlings, the Maroons com-
pleted the first half of a strenuous
week of practice in preparation for the
invasion of the league leading Badger
quintet. The freshman battled the
varsity on even terms for the major
part of the workout but the rough
guarding tactics of the Maroons, final-
ly halted the first year men.

That Norgren will reply on the
Maroon defense to produce victory
was evident from the practice session
last night. In view of the fact that
the Maroons have proved that they
cannot score more than twenty points
a game, Norgren has decided to keep
the opposition from scoring less than
a score of markers.

This^ is certainly a difficult task
since Meanwell’s five boast a high
powered offense. Wisconsin after a
layoff of three weeks will be primed
to put out the strongest team it has
sent out on the floor this season. A
victory for the Badgers will give them
a flying start in the title race. De-
feat will send the Madisonites from
first to fourth place.

Then again the visitors are anxious
to revenge the 17 to 15 upset that the
locals handed them early in Hie sea-
son. It is said that Doc Meanwell has
perfected a defense for the Midway
out of bounds play and at the same
time will use a new type passing at-
tack that will baffle the Chicago
guarding system. If these rumors are
true, it bodes ill for the Maroons.
For if Bahr, the former Rockford
flash, ever gets loose he is capable
of any number of baskets. Powers,
a guard, is the fellow w’ho sunk the
powerful Hoosiers with somje well
aimed long shots. It is these boys
that are causing the Maroons plenty
of worry.

play between the events. A grand
opening is to be staged, in which all
the fall and winter sport writers will
be presented to the audience, to be
'followed by the awarding of the
handsome array of trophies, now on
exhibition at the U. of C. Bookstore.
Many surprise events, circus stunts
and the like, are also included, all of
them to be highly entertaining. Fra-
ternities will compete in a song fest
to keep things going at a high pitch
at all times. No dull moments will
intervene.

Of high interest should be the
Final “A” League Basketball game,
which will also take place on the final
night. This contest is to decide the
championship of the University,
which was son by the Phi Psis last
year when they played the Delts at
the First Annual Carnival. The Phi
Psis also took first honors in the car-
nival.

Elaborate decorations are planned
for the entire gymnasium. Shields
of all the fraternities are to feature
this, with banners and streamers of
maroon and white in the background.
Booths are to be placed at every
corner, and to top the wonderful
program off, a “mixer” (dance) will
end the festivities for the evening.

THE DAILY MAROON.THURSDAY. FEBRUARY



I thought, is a Baptist school. Why
should it not take steps to keep
heresy out of the minds of its child-
ren? Here, I considered, was a
school filled with children at the
impressionable age, fresh from home
and mother. What effect might not
such blasphemy as was probably in
this article have on the mind of the
growing boy? I looked up, from my
musings, aroused by violent alterca-
tion at my elbow. There were two
of the growing boys whose well-be-
ing had aroused my train of thought.
One, a greybeard of fifty, was argu-
ing some obscure point in the life of
Judas Maccabee with another, a run-
down, senile looking child of forty-
seven. “Freshmen,” I thought, “Just
look how their youthful ardor is
aroused. Ah, youth . . . youth.”

The university, after all, was broad-
minded. Prof. Mathews, Mr. Scopes,
the biology, physiology and zoology
departments would continue to go
their way in peace. I was quiet
jubilant: I walked off whistling
“Wave the Flag of Old Chicago.”

Although the night meet u ® be the
big one. the afternoon program will
be interesting, beaded as it is by the
three college relays, mile, medley and
two-mile and the high school mile
relay.

I continued my pondering, if such
comparatively harmless stuff as was
in the Mercury was thought fit to be
censored, what would the authorities
stop with when they found out what
heresies were being taught in the
school itself? Would a board of cen-
sors go through the biology, phy-
siology and zoology text-books and
red-pencil all the impious leachings
of evolution? Would Prof. Shailer
Mathews hereafter be forced to de-
liver his lectures before a board of
Baptist deacons gunning for heresy
before being allowed to deliver them
in the classroom? Would John
Thomas Scopes, hero of the Dayton }
ordeal and now lodged at Gates HaR
here at the university, be asked to
go some place where they would not
poison the minds of youth? All these
ideas poured through my mind.

I determined to get at the truth
of this censoring. I applied at the
Reynolds club desk for information
as to who clipped, and why. I was
told that the act had not been done
by an official hand. I was told that
the Reynolds club had always main-
tained. and would continue to main-
tain, a broad-minded policy. I turn-
