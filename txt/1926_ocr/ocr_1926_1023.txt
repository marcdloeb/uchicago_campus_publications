^^^b^nMIDWAY TEAM ENTERS BIG TEN RACE

When a little tot, not so long ago,
I was brought up.........as all good
children are—on the Contes de Mere
Goose. One of my favorite jingles
then (and a thing which I still de-
claim Wednesday mornings over at
the frat house as the waffles are
brought in on their lone appearance
of the week) held the sentiment:

“Big ‘A’) little ‘a’,
Today’s pancake day.”
This, I thought in those days far
away and long ago, was a profound,
a searching thought. With what felic-
ity and peculiar penetration did it ex-
press a thought at once simple, yet
moving! And so, today I turn again
to that ‘‘powerful rhyme” to express
the idea that today’s football day, and
the readers of this column must get
their dose of football here from me
like a baby getting its daily orange
from mama, willy-nilly. Recite the
jingle, boys, substituting the word
“football” for “pancacke,” and save
me the trouble of writing it down
again.

* * * *

Two weeks ago at the time of the
Maryland game, I gave voice to the
opinion that the situation pertaining
to Mr. Stagg’s Maroons did not pre-
sent very many rifts in the clouds
through which the sun could peep. The
developments of Franklin Field cor-
roborated, to a certain extent, this
statement. Today we are met on an-
other solemn occasion—that yearly
three hours spent in looking into the
evidence to see whether Mr. Stagg’s
rumored trepidation over Purdue is
founded on just cause. It has always
been my platform, voicing though I
have a certain fear for the outcome of
the season, that Chicago would win
one Conference game* The lineup of
teams, beginning with Purdue today,
is tough for the Maroons. It is diffi-
cult to see just where the one victory
will come in. Purdue’s tough; so are
Ohio, Illinois, Northwestern and
Wisconsin. It is, I admit, an enigma
which one, if any, of those teams we
will knock off. Somehow the thought
persists that the proof of my conten-
tion rests with today’s battle, and
that the gathering shadows will see
my faith in the ability of the boys—
slight though it be—vindicated. If it
is not, I shall retire to a back seat
and sit down, for if a licking comes
today, can more be far behind?

♦ * ♦ *	,

Next week cometh Ohio, with what
looks to me to be more like those old-
time Buckeye teams that used to per-
form in the days of Harley, Stinch-
comb, Truck Meyers and Hoge Work-
man than anything Dr. Wilce has
been able to muster up ?ince. Ohio
came upon lean days about tour years
ago, but now the Scarlet and Gray
seems definitely to left them behind.
In its last two games, against Ohio
Wesleyan and Columbia, both of them
pretty fair football teams, Ohio ran
up but fourteen first downs while scor-
ing eighty points. That is a certain
indication that the old style Buckeye
teams are coming to the fore again ,for
the ^statistics indicate, if anything,
lightning-quick scoring power after
breaks. The old Wilce teams used to
win in the same way—waiting all af-
ternoon without doing much for a
break, and then taking advantage of it
with all the resourcefulness and pow-
er that was characteristic of them.

“Well, well, well,—if it ain’t 'old
popper. How are yuh? And th’ ma-
ter? How’s things going back home?
How’s th’ dog? Huh? And say—how’s
f’r a check? Huh?”—That’s it’d be
like if this were Dad’s Day, instead
of Father’s Day, as fortunately it is.

Tradition	is a great thing to fall	

back on. Wonders have been

plished in upholding it. There is a
tradition connected with the Chicago
-Purdue battles of yore, and it seems
as if the Maroons must rely wholly
upon it to win the game today. The
tradition is that Purdue never wins
and Chicago never loses. Both teams
have faithfully observed it—so faith-
fully that since 1898 Purdue has
won but once and that time in 1918
when all the football players were
serving under the colors of the U. S.

Thus Chicago will be fighting for
the proper observance of an old, re-
vered cjnvention. Sta^g will take
pains in his lecture before the game
to explain to his men that just as
faithfully as Chicago has not won
from Penn so should they never lose
to Purdue. It simply isn’t being
done.

The Purdue players will have no
such high and moralistic motive be-
hind them. They will just be armed
with an abundance of football skill.
Phelan has taught them a lot of
tricks which go well against any nor-
mal outfit, but how they will func-
tion against a team which has tradi-
tion to rely on, which hears the fiery
oratory of Stagg before each game,
and which on some occasions sings is
a problem.

On straightforward, unadulaterat-
ed dope Purdue should have the edge.
They have played two strong elev-
ents in the Navy and Wisconsin and
have behaved in most becoming fash-
ion; while the Maronns have not
looked right the whole season, even
against the exceptionally weak teams

What Next?—Chicago Has Lost

One To Pardue In 28 Years

During the past twenty-eight years
Purdue has defeated a Maroon foot-
ball team but once and succeeded in
tieing another game, the defeat com-
ing in 1918 (the S. A. T. C. year),
and the no-decision contest in 1901.
Before that, during the years 1892-
’93 and ’94 the Boilermakers de-
feated Chicago 38-0, 20-10 and 10
to 6. No games were played between
1894 and 1898.

Scores follow:

1892—Purdue 38; Chicago 0.
1893—Purdue 20; Chicago 10.
1894—Purdue 10; Chicago 6.
1898—Chicago 17; Purdue 0.

PLAYERS SPURT
LIGHT UNIFORMS

Purdue Outfit* Include
Featherweight Pants

Lighter uniforms, the latest crea-
tions in football equipment, will be
the vogue on the Midway this after-
noon. Purdue will be outfitted with
special featherweight pants to which
the padding is added by the trainer
before each game and the Maroons
will romp with two and a half pounds
less weight per uniform due also to
a change in padding.

The Purdue pants, which are the
result of Coach James Phelan’s la-
bor, were initiated in the Purdue-
Navy game this season. Since then
Knute Rockne has been “sold” on
the idea and will have his Notre
Dame horses equipped with them for
the Jirst time, in the Northwestern
game, this afternoon.

Rubber-foam, a light spongy prep-
aration will substitute for the old
horse hair pads formerly employ-
ed in all football uniforms. This
new material, especially imported
from France was first adopted by
Coach Stagg, but has found favor
with many of the Big Ten Coaches
by now.

Besides beiAg considerably lighter
and of less burden to the players,
it is less absorbent in case of wet
weather and perspiration.

Unless there’s a tie score, some-
body will win this here football
game.

Some scribes say Purdue will win.
Many scribes, in fact. Some scribes
say that dear old Chicago will win.
Not so many scribes, in fact. But
this scribe makes the above predic-
tion, and what he means to say is
that it’s anybody’s game—regardless
of what the Boilermakers and the
grandstand coaches think.

Purdue intends to win. Take the
football team, for instance. They
held Wisconsin scoreless last Sat-
urday and had a wide, wide edge
over the highly rated Cardinals. Of
course the Maroons were highly rat-
ed until they played Penn—however,
that’s another story. But Purdue has
a 106 piece band, that played down-
town yesterday, and things like that.
And 5,000 undergrads came along
(please do not contrast with number
of Chicagoans at Penn) to cheer for
old Purdue.

Iff addition to that, the loyal Alum-
ni held their Annual Banquet last
night to sort of off-set the Pep-Ses-
sion that the Maroons engaged in.

Well, folks, Purdue intends to win.
And down in LaFayette the boys and
girls are planning one magnificent
celebration. But by the by—Chi-
cago intends to win too.

Maroon Band To
Form Living Flag
During Half Time

Purdue will have its famous Boil-
ermaker Band at the Chicago-Pur-
due game today. The Maroon Band
with its new uniforms, consisting of
maroon-colored sweaters, white
pants, maroon ties and white caps, is
not to be outdone. Between halves
both bands will parade the field and
exchange numbers. The Maroon
Band will march into the formation
of a flag in front of the Chicago
stand and play the old University
song, “Flag of Maroon.” This song
was among those recently rendered

by Stagg’s boys at the beginning of
the Chicago-Florida game. Students
and alumni in the Chicago stand re-
membering this old favorite will ac-
company the band in song.

MIDWAY HARRIERS
IN OPENING MEET

This morning the Maroon cross
country team was to participate in a
quadrangle meet with Wisconsin, In-
diana, and Northwestern. The run was
to be over a two and one-half mile
course in Washington Park and mark-
ed the debute of the 1926 team. The
runners on the Maroon team were:
Hitz, Hegowick, Williams, Burke,
Jackson, Bryan, Dystrap and Burndt-
son. The teams and coaches of In-
diana and Wisconsin are guests at the
game this afternoon.

‘Togo’ Dygert is a regular quarter

player and is quite elusive in spite of
his size. His straight arm is ex-
ceedingly effective. At the start of
the season he was handicapped by an
incomplete grade and did not get out
for early practise. He has good con-
trol of the team and the men have
confidence in him. ‘Togo’ is the sec-

One of the most important Big
Ten games of the year comes off this
afternoon at Ann Arbor when Zup-
pke’s aggregation meets the outfit
coached by Fielding Yost.

Battle Between Backs

The contest hinges on the per-
formance of the backs. If both teams
were to rely on a steady line plunge
the game would undoubtedly be very
close, Illinois perhaps having the
edge. However with the Friedman to
Ooosterbaan combination working
as it knows how, the game may de-
velop into a one sided affair, with
Michigan on the long end of the
score. Another probability is a battle
of drop kickers, and here two of the
best field goal kickers of the country
will oppose each other. Friedman for
Michigan and Peters for Illinois.,

Pagemen At Madison

If the Cardinals have not, in the
past few days, acquired a more de-

one’s game. The Badgers have a

View Game from Student
“C” Section; Will

Dine in Gym

Hundreds of fathers of undergrad-
uates are sitting in the student “C”
book section this afternoon with
their sons and daughters viewing the
Chicago-Purdue game. In the stands
there are fathers from nearly every
section of the United States who
have come to the campus today to
celebrate the University’s first “Fa-
thers’ Day.”

This Is the Official Program:
Tour of the campus at 10.

Football game in Stagg Field at 2.

Open house in Reynolds club and
at fraternity houses from 4 to 6.

Dinner in Bartlett gymnasium at
6.

Student Vaudeville show in Man-
del hall at 8.

Prominent Visitors

In the “C” section there are a
number of fathers who were once
students on the campus themselves.
One of the most prominent of these
is James M. Sheldon, member of Phi
Delta Theta, who graduated from the
University in 1903 after winning
four C’s in football.

Alfred W. Place, member of Beta
Theta Pi, who graduated in 1903 is
also here. He won letters in foot-
ball in ’99 and 1900, for baseball in
1900, ’01, and ’02 and for track in
’01 and ’02. He now lives in Bowl-
ing Green, Ohio.

Thomas Albert Lamb, who attend-
ed the dedication ceremonies of
Cobb hall and William J. Bogan who
graduated in 1909 and is now assist-
ant Superintendent of Schools in
Chicago are also here.

New Activity Here

President Max Mason, Coach Amos
Alonzo Stagg and Dean Chauncey
Boucher are behind the Fathers’ Day
program, hoping that it will become
an annual activity of the University.
The plans for today’s event were ar-
ranged and carried out however, by
a committee of undergraduates head-
ed by Clyde Keutzer.

Henry Sackett and Edna Wilson
conducted the tour; Robert Harmon
and Ray Murphy made arrange-
ments for tickets to the foilball
game; Harold Schwede and Ruth
Burtis have arranged the dinner for
this evening; Fred Von Ammon and
Margaret Carr will stage the vaude-
ville show; and Deemer Lee conduct-
ed the publicity.

HERE ARE THE 1926
RECORDS FOR BOTH
ELEVENS TO DATE

Purdue, 21; Wabash 14.

Purdue, 13; Navy, 17.

Purdue, 0; Wisconsin, 0.

Chicago, 12; Florida, 6.

Chicago, 21; Maryland, 0.

Chicago, 0; Penn, 27.

From a glance at the two teams’
records thus far this season the follow-
cold facts are to be noted. Each team
has had their offense held scoreless in
one game. Chicago has won two, lost
one; Purdue has won one, lost one,
tied one. Each team has lost to an
eastern opponent. Purdue holds the
edge in Conference games played,
while Chicago leads in intersectional
honors. Each team has scored thirty-
three points so far this year.

SPIRIT

THERE always have been and probably always will be criticisms.

* generally unfavorable, about this University, about the Maroon
athletic teams and about the spirit of the undergraduate body. One
of most frequently used arguments to seduce prospective students
from this center of learning is that there is no college life here, that
the students are impersonal in their relations.

Whether or not these so-called critics are fully qualified to judge
or not is beside the point. The criticisms are spoken or written, they
are hearsay or whatever appears in print, and the incorrect impres-
sion remains to be recalled whenever the University of Chicago is
mentioned.

This is no time to defend our institution from such careless gos-
sip. We do not claim to have the lauded “rah-rah” spirit, we do not
need it, and furthermore, we do not want it. We are in college for
the purpose of acquiring an education and not to spend our time in
devising faddish clothes, in driving dilapitated flivvers, or in wander-
ing about the town singing the praises of our Alma Mater to the de-
spair of the sensibly-sleeping inhabitants.

What replaces that small college tone on this campus is some-
thing infinitely great: ., something that every Maroon man and wom-
an acquires only by close association with the University and its tra-
ditions. It is not visible to the casual observer; sometimes not to
careful observers. It is not the frosting on the cake, it is the bottom
layer. The thing that distinguishes it is that it appears in full strength
at the opportune times.

Such a demonstration took place last night at the pep session.
Knowing that the team was defeated disastrously by Pennsylvania
last Saturday, knowing that the following day the squad was to op-
pose a team of no mean ability, one that for many years past has
been a certain, if not an easy conquest, but which this year is reputed
to have great odds over Coach Stagg's warriors, the students filled
Mandel hall to capacity to instill confidence into the team, to show
each individual member that the entire student body was behind him,
and to challenge him to do his very best.

Of such is the true Chicago spirit.

THE GREATEST STATE UNIVERHSITY







SOME member of The Daily Illini staff had an idea recently. The re-
sult was an editorial in yesterday’s paper which takes the Univer-
sity of Chicago and more particularly Mr. George Morgenstern for
a ride. Mr. Morgenstern, according to The Illini, is a “staffite” of
The Daily Maroon.

It seems that the earnest and hard working collegians of The
Greatest State University object to Mr. Morgenstern’s description of
their redoubtable football team as “hog butchers”; they dislike his
reference to "the story book college atmosphere” of The Greatest
State University. Strange!

Unfortunately we are not at the University of Illinois; but if we
were we would certainly boast of the collegiate atmosphere of the
place. This atmosphere is widely advertised and many colleges claim
to have it, but the genuine article is rarely found-—only, we think, at
The Greatest State University and in the Sears-Roebuck book sec-
tion. Of course, there are good reasons for this. The influential por-
tion of the urbana student body consists of graduates of the noisier
and rowdier Chicago high schools, places where the elements of col-
legian are well taught. They don’t come to this school—they can’t
get in, for literacy tests are still used on all our prospective fresh-
men.

But then, what can one expect! The huge factory at Urbana is
supported by the state for the education of its masses. And while
being educated the masses of course amuse themselves in the normal
way. In the absence of dog fights, good old burlesque shows and
Clown Parades, crafty digs at Mr. Morgenstern, at our conscientious
football team, and at the University of Chicago generally are of
course in order.

ILLINOIS SCOUTS

BAFFLED BY PENN

PIGSKIN JUGGLING

Penn Invades Champaign
With 3,000 Rooters and
Band of 100

Fortified with all the information
that the Illinois scouts could gain at
the Pennsylvania-Williams game,
Coach Bob Zuppke will set to work
the first of the week to solve the great-
est football mystery of the year—the
“hidden ball.”

According to the Illini scouts, Penn
snaps the ball and for the next fif-
teen minutes it is passed back and
forth in a mysterious manner. To
quote one newspaper observer, “you

don’t know whether the ball is in the
grand stand or on display in the press
box.” Sooner or later, a red and blue
streaked warrior appears out in the
open galloping goalward.

Can Illini Solve Maroon’s Nemesis?

'his is the play which completely
baffled Stagg’s Maroons who tackled
player after player, only to miss the
right man who had the ball. It is go-
ing to take a lot of smart coaching and
playing if the Illini are to succeed
where the Maroons failed. Critics who
have studied the Penn stratagem de-
, dare that it will fool any team.

Pennsylvania, followed by its band
of 100 pieces and 3000 rooters will in-
vade the stadium confident of obtain-
ing revenge for Illinois’ overwhelming
victory on Franklin field last year. The
Illini invaders were well treated at
Penn. Philadelphia donned orange and
blue in honor of the middle western-
ers and Illinois in turn will display
the red and blue.

Now that the sale for the big inter-
sectional engagement has passed the
50,000 mark, leaving approximately
14,000 seats, the outlook for a crowded
stadium seems excellent. However, the
Illini managers expect pasteboards to
be available for most of the week and
perhaps up to the time of the game.

Fwo Alumni Take
Federal Positions

Two alumni of the University, Wil-
liam P. McCracken and David Wal-
lace Stewart, have been recently ap-
pointed to government positions, in
recognition of their public work.

William P. McCracken, of the class
'09, has been appointed Secretary of
Civil Aviation in the United States,
a position which approximates that of
assistant to the Secretary of Com-
merce. The Department of Com-
merce at Washingtn, D. C., created
this office to meet the demands made
by the growth of aviation. This is
the first official recognition the gov-
ernment has made in regard to avi-
ation authorities. Mr. McCracken is
also Secretary of the American Bar
Association.

David Wallace Stewart, of the class
of ’07, has been recently elected
United States Senator from Iowa.
He was nominated for this position
by the Republican State Convention
in Iowa, to fill the position of the
late Senator Cummins. -Since the
Democratic party did not nominate
any one to oppose him, Mr. Wal-
lace was automatically elected Sen-
ator. He is the youngest man that
has ever held a senatorial position in
Iowa.

First Fathers’ Day
Expected to Rival
Minnesota Festivity

The University celebrates its first
annual Fathers’ Day today, and the
student chairmen expect it to result as
well as the Dad’s Day held at Minne-
sota recently which was attended by
over 2,000 fathers of Minnesota stu-
dents. They duplicated Chicago’s
plan by occupying a special block ox
seats reserved tor them at the Notre
Dame-Minnesota football game in the
afternoon and attending a special din-
ner in the evening. At the dinner a
“Dad’s Benefit Fund” for needy stu-
dents was started. The program for
the day also included the customary
tour of the campus and welcoming
speeches by the president and other
dignitaries.

Capt. Marks Makes Big Ten Debut Today

Dr. Robert Andrews Millikan, for-
merly Professor of Physics at the Uni-
versity, and now Director of Norman
Bridge Laboratory, California Insti-
tute of Technology in Pasadena, will
deliver a William Vaughn Moody lec-
ture on “Evolution in Science and in
Religion,” Saturday evening at 8 in
Harper Assembly Hall.

Dr. Millikan will be remembered
with the greatest cordiality and inter-
est by those who were his colleagues
a very few years ago in the University.
He is now one of the outstanding
physicists of the world. In 1924 he
was granted the Nobel Prize, largely
on account ,pf his researches, the re-
sults of which contributed greatly to
science’s knowledge of the atom, the
determination of the charge of the
electron, the ultimate unit of electric-
ity.

Millikan Has Varied Interests

Other lines of research in which he
has been interested are photoelectric
effect, the viscosity of gases, the mo-
tions of gas molecules due to their
heat energy’. It is largely through
Professor Millikan’s work and under
his direction that the gap between the

The Intramural Department at
the University has spent $4,000, for
trophies to be issued to the winners
of the various Intramural events.
The prizes consist of trophies, small
and large cups, gold and silver and
bronze medallettes. Plans have been
made to make this the biggest year
the department has yet had. The of-
fice is run under Dr. C. O. Moland-
er. The senior managers are John
Howe and John Meyer. Arnold John-
son, Gordon Wallace, Lalon Farwell
and William Weddell are the junior
managers. With these men in the
lead no activity could fail. However,
it is up to the fraternities and other
organizations to get their men out
and on the field on time.

Touchball is well under way and

•year. This year with more places
in each event and more elaborate
trophies than ever, the Division
hopes to have an even larger turn-
out than last year. In addition to the
standard events there will be several
novelty races.

Green streamered and green cap-
ped freshmen who lazily stroll across
campus allowing their streamers to
droop, learned yesterday that their
indolence would cost them their
membership in the Green Cap club.

The first candidate was dropped
yesterday during the meeting be-
cause his attitude was branded as
unbecoming an aspirant to the organ-
ization.

Appearance on the campus with-
out the green cap, failure to run
while crossing the quadrangle, or
standing at the entrance of Cobb
Hall are considered sufficient rea-
sons for dismissal from the organ-
ization. A new provision for the
freshman honor society this year is
that the membership will be reduced
to forty; last year 100 members
made up this group, therefore the
requirements proceeding the initia-
tion will be strictly enforced.

Final judgment will be based on
the following points: attitude toward
campus activities, attendance at
meetings and Monday noon lunch-
eons, and the relative standing in
the final examination. This examina-
tion will occur the Friday before the

Illinois game and will be based on
the aspirants’ knowledge of campus
songs, rules, traditions, and men con-
nected with the University.

ond lightest man on the team weigh-
ing onl^ 145 pounds.

Courtney Gleason is one of the
greenest men on the Chicago foot-
ball team but one of the most prom-
ising that the Midway has seen in
many years. In his prep days at
Hyde Park he ignored football to
devote all of his time to soccer. He
entered Chicago in the spring anH
has been under the tutelage of the
Old Man for two spring practises.
Because of his great speed he was
singled out and taught the rudiments
of the game. He has assimilated
much and is now, with the exception
of McKinney, the fastest ball-carrier
on the squad. He is an extremely
fearless player and since he is only
a sophomore he has a great future.
One hundred eighty is his poundage.

Vincent Libby has the distinction
of having run 35 yards for a touch-
down on his first play in the first var-
sity game that he played. So far he
has carried the ball three times for
a total gain of 45 yards, 35 against
Maryland and 10 against Penn. Like
Leyers he has been developed by
Coach A. A. Stagg since he entered
the University and now is the sort of
of a player that Coach Stagg wants.

Things are going great in the mi-
nor sports department of the Univer-
sity. The gym team, the swimming
team, wrestling and water polo teams,
all have fine material, the gym team
having four letter men remaining to
bolster up the squad Captain David-
son, Jimmy Flexner, last year’s run-
nerup for the undivided national cham-
pionship, and Jerry Quinn, last year’s
captain will dgain form a promising
nucleus around which Coach Hoffer
can develop a well balanced team.

The varsity shimming squad has
almcst the exact lineup of last year’s
team, Gilchrist, Petrolowitz, last year’s
polo captain and Lane being the only
ones missing. Captain Noyes, Jerry

Greenburg, Rittenhouse
other stars have returned
ing excellent work in
meetings. A promising
the team. Hough, a last

addition to
year’s num-

eral man in the dashes has also turned

Polo Team Promising

The polo men are working faithfully
and show excellent prospects of being
a dependable team when the season
opens. Coach MacGillivary has the fol-
lowing comment, “To the casual spec-
tator water polo is just another sport,
but to the player it is a very strenuous
game. People have to be educated to
water polo.”

The wrestling squad has a number
of promising freshman out, and while
several of the prospective team are
trying out for football, Levine 117
pounds, and Simberling 158 pounds,
both numeral men of the ’29 squad
have turned out.

FATHER AND SONS’ DAY

From fifteen-hundred cities

And forty-seven states
Our Dads are fast arriving.
So let’s welcome them, my Mates.

They are cold from tiresome journeys
They are tired from their rides.

They need food to help regain their
strength

And warm their chilled insides.

Bring out the wines and liquers.
Take down the silver flask,
And offer them the goblet

E’er they’ve half a chance to ask.

Though we are still at college

And are much too young (?) for wine

Fathers still appreciate

Our proffers in that line.

THE COMMITTEE in charge of
Fathers’ and Sons’ Day were wise in
accepting no advanced reservations
for t he Fathers ’and Sons’ dinner af-
ter the game today. As things now
stand, tickets for the affair will be on
sale at the door. The idea is, we sup-
pose, that a lot of the Sons, at least,
are not reasonably sure of their bets

and so do not know whether or
they’ll FEEL like eating after

stronger team than
Indiana, both in
weight. A Cardinal
logical thing after

their opponents,
experience and
comeback is the
their failure to

score on Purdue last week. The
Hoosiers showed real football in
holding the Wildcats scoreless for
three quarters, and this game, which
has been doped as an easy affair for
Wisconsin, will probably develop into
a hard affair.

Ohio Strong On Passes

Iowa may lost to Ohio State be-
cause of a weaker passing attack.
Though the lines and running at-
tacks of the two teams may be even,
Ohio is sure to throw numerous for-
ward passes and Iowa is doped to
surrender to the same fault which
made them forfeit the Illinois game
last week.

Minnesota will be able to take it
easy when they meet Wabash. The
little school should offer some relief
to the Gophers after hard games
with Notre Dame and Michigan.

Northwestern has a strong team
this season, but it is not yet of Notre
Dame’s caliber. Rockne’s backs will
not at all find easy going, but should
win in the second half with their
far greater man-power. The Irish
possess a grinding attack such as the
Purple have not yet seen this year.

that Florida and Maryland sent here.
Purdue has shown an attack with va-
riation that succeeds against good
teams, while Chicago failed miser-
ably to make or hold ground in their
first real test against Penn. Purdue
has been consistently fair, and the
Maroon playing has been alternate-
ly poor and fair. According to prev-
ious showings then, the game is al-
most as good as Purdue’s already,
but as pointed out before there will
be something more than football in-
volved.

Purdue is the more polished team
but the Maroons have the edge in
weight. If the Chicago line proves
to be the more powerful Phelan’s
tricks will not be nearly so effective
and the work of Wilcox and Koran-
sky, Purdue backfield luminaries,
will be curbed considerably. Chi-
cago’s weight will show to advantage
in case tne Maroons are unable to
cope with Purdue’s open play and
are backed up against their own goal
line. Purdue although brilliant in
mid-field lacks the weight and pow-
er to push the ball over when they
near the goal-line.

The superior weight of the Ma-

roons and the abstract factors

be-

hind them should offset the skill ad-
vantage held by the visitors and re-
sult in an interesting game. •

A PLEA

In the annals of the football field
You can read the brilliant feats
Of many brainy, dashing men
Who’ve carved their names with
flashing cleats.

Yet, every story sings the praise

Of backfield men who used to shine
And there is not a single tale

About the boys who played the line.

’Tis wrong, I think, that we forget
These heroes of the forward wall,
Por sans their mighty fighting hearts
There'd be no backfield stars at all.

So too, there are a lot of girls
Who can not brag of pretty feature".!
Though they’re smart and full of pep
The boys believe them hopeless crea-
tures.

Of course these girls are sensitive.

They realize their sorry plight
They know they’re never popular
They’re sure to feel that its not right
And so they read the magazines
That tell you how to make your name,
And, finally, develop lines
That put the pretty girls to shame.

Hats off, my friends, to all these girls

Who, though not pretty, dance and
dine

With all the grace of pretty girls

And—most of all—who play the line!

He’s the One Who Originated the
Saying, “Stagg Fears Purdue!”
