ALPHA DELT TO
ENTERTAIN FOR

MIRRORWOMEN

Announce Names of Seniors
to Act as Ushers for

Performances

Immediately following the opening
performance of Mirror Friday night
the members of Alpha Delta Phi will
receive all the members of the cast
and staff of Mirror at a reception
at their house.

Include Escorts

The men are preparing to extend
their hospitality to the women and
their escorts after the performance
until 11:30. Seward Covert, who is
handling the affair, has urged that
the women come to the reception
without escorts, and declares that
that was the original plan of the
entertainment committee. The modi-
fication was made to include the
men that had made engagements
with any of the members of the com-
pany.

The hosts and hostesses will be
Mr. and Mrs. Frederick C. Wood-
ward, Mr. and Mrs. James Weber
Linn, Mr. and Mrs. Robert V. Mer-
rill, Mrs. Edith Foster Flint, Mr.
Frank H. O’Hara and Miss Elizabeth
Wallace.

QUEEN ELIZABETH’S
SECRETARY NOT A
PRIG-STATES READ

Lord Cecil Burghley, secretary to
Good Queen Bess and famed in Eng-
lish history as one of the greatest
personalities of the Elizabethan
reign was second in greatness only
to the Elizabeth. This was the sub-
stance of the lecture by Dr. Conyers
Read yesterday.

That Lord Burghley was not a
prig Dr. Read pointed out by the
fact that while Burghley was an
undergraduate on the Cambridge
campus\ he married a wineshop
keeper’s daughter, but Dr. Read has-
tened to add, she was certainly an
unusual wineshop keeper's daughter.
Dr. Read proved the Nationalist’s
eccentricity by the fact that Lard
Burghley never used arabic numerals
but Roman numerals always.

Among til? other indivdual char-
acteristics of the great statesman
were that he did not care for travel,
that his learning was confined to
books and letters chiefly, and that
he arranged his family tree to his
own satisfaction. That Lord Burgh-
ley’s was not an authentic family
tree has been proven by recent his-
torians.

This lecture on Lord Burghley by
Dr. Read was the second of his talks
on Elizabethan Personalities. “Mary
Stuart the Roman ^Catholic,” and
“Francis Walsingham, the Puritan”
the the subjects of the two lectures
which are to be delivered at 4:30 in
Harper M-11 today and Friday

VOTES ON COUNCIL
TAKEN IN COBB 110

An omission from yesterday’s
Daily Maroon is delaying the count
of the ballots cast for election of
the Junior candidates for the Un-
dergraduate council and the Honor
commission. The purport of the
notice that was sent into the Ma-
roon office day -before yesterday
was all those who were absent from
chapel at the time of the election
would have another chance to make
their will known by casting their
vote in Cobb 110.

Inasmuch as the votes did not
come in there, the opportunity is
extended until today. All those who
wish to take advantage of this op-
portunity are urged by the Under-
graduate council to vote from 1Z
to 1 in Cobb 110 today so that the
record can be made at a special
meeting of the Council this after-
noon at 2:30.

The meeting of the Council yes-
terday was short, because they were
unable to take any definite action
in regard to the Junior elections.
The results will be announced in
tomorrow’s Maroon.

WOMEN BANNED

IN STYLE SHOW

University Forces Y. M. to
Take Women from Acts

Because of University rulings which
J forbid campus women to take part tn
any performance which shall be wit-
nessed solely by a male audience, the
Y. M. C. A. Style show will have to
change its plans. '

Mrs. Edith Foster Flint, chairman
of the Women’s council, notified El-
liot Ness, head of the Style Show
committee, last night that it would be
impossible for the V. M. C. A. to go
on with the performance as announced
in the Daily Maroon yesterday.

Make New Plans

Although other plans have been
made the feature women’s orchestra
from the Mirror cast, the acts by Lois
Russel and Joana Downs, and the
Charleston exhibition by Janet Good,
have all been called off and a new
“show strictly of men for men” has
been arranged.

fore the dinner the three Junior

Afterwards the new chairman, Dor-
othy Kennedy, will explain the duties
of each position to the member. The
installation ceremony will follow’ in
the traditional way.

DELAY COUNTING
JUNIOR BALLOT;
OUT TOMORROW

Open Polls in Cobb 110 To
Students Not At

Chapel

A reporter from The Daily
Maroon attended the meeting of
the Undergraduate council yes-
terday afternoon. Below is his
account of the results of elections
to the Honor commission—the
only business transacted at yes-
terday’s meeting. He will attend
and report all meetings of the
council hereafter.

Eleanor Wilkins and Earl Baker
were the sophomore candidates chosen
for positions on the Honor commis-
sion at the election held in chapel day
before yesterday. This conclusion was
reached after the count of the first
ballot. Second to Eleanor Wilkins
and Mary Harvey, who received 126
votes to the victor’s 157. Earl Baker
defeated Durwood Lockart by a count
of 148 to 134.

The results ot the junior elections
will not be decided until today accord-
ing to the Council, because those of
the class who were unable to attend
chapel did not know where to cast
their ballots. These votes will be re-
ceived in Cobb 110 today. A meeting
of the Undergraduate council will
make the final decision on the elec-
tion.

Morris Chaim

Dental Award

By Mary Winner Hughes

Toothbrush, pick, and paste did
not figure among Melanesian toilet
accessories, and yet their ancient
teeth were better than our modern
ones. So says Wilton Marion Krog-
man, student in the department of
Anthropology, at the University, I
and Krogman should know, for yes-1
terday he received word that his pa-
per, “The Anthropological Aspect of j
Human Teeth and Dentation” has I
received the Morris L. Chaim prize
of $250.

This prize, offered yearly under j
the auspices of the First District
Dental Society of New York, for the
best piece of original dental research
work for the year, receives wide at- (
tention and stirs up close competi- j
tion.

Returning Saturday from a trip to
New York, Mr. Arnett and his wife
l were both taken ill and have been un-
der the care of a trained nurse since
their arrival in the city.

Had Planned Dinner

The illness of Mr. Arnett made it
impossible for the chapter of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity on the campus to
carry out their plans last night to
honor him before he leaves for New
York.

Extensive preparations were being
made to entertain him with a farewell

been the honored guest.

Smart Set? Hot
Dog? Hijinks?—
Not Our Campus!

By Al E. Widdifield

Puritanism, super-aesceticism, so-
phistication—all seem descriptive of
the campus community in the eyes
of those who are endeavoring to put
a ban on the current “smutty” liter-
ature which is hogwallowing the
American press.

Down in Kansas City they filed
an injunction in the District court to
prevent the sale and distribution of
thirteen magazines containing im-
moral reading matter. It seems there
is a Kansas law which forbids the cir-
culation of publications of a scanda-
lous or lecherous nature.

But the book shops in, and adja-
cent to, the campus are not experi-
encing any demand for any of the
magazines named in the Kansas in-

I junction.

Is it because campus people are
so busy they have no time to in-
dulge in such literary or art pur-
suits? Is it because they have risen
to such etherial heights that they
could not stomach the flavour of
such literature? Or is it because
of it’s mere banality and their utter
sophistication?

At any rate the socalled “smutty”

HUSK O’HARE TO
PLAY AT SPANISH

FIESTA SATURDAY

j Because of the quality of the
dance music that he has furnished
for the campus dances for which he
has played this year, Husk O’Hare
has been engaged to furnish, with
his Casino club ensemble, the music
for the Spanish Fiesta next Saturday

I night at 9 in Ida Noyes hall. The
orchestra will wear Spanish cos-
tumes.

The decorations will be in the form
of red and yellow streamers which
will, according to the chairman of
the decoration committee, add to the
I foreign atmosphere of the dance.
] Spanish food will be served for re-
I freshments.

Miss Margie Rink, who has several
times danced in Balaban and Katz
productions, will entertain with a
tango and toe dance.

It is hoped by the officials of the
party that those who attend will
I come in costume, but no requirement
। has been laid down on this point.

A grand march, led by Miss Yo-
landa Simez and Richard Kern will
begin at 10 o’clock after which a
prize will be -presented to the woman
with the best costume.

Mr. Lupian and Mr. Armador,
Mexican consul and Vice-consul to
the United States, will be the guests
of honor at the Fiesta. Bids are on
sale at two dollars.

Dinner On Wednesday

Wednesday at 6 in the sun parlor of
Ida Noyes hall. This dinner is the
last big function of the fiscal year.
In former years the dinner has been
held either in the refectory or the
gymnasium, and it has been prom-
ised that it will be something of a
departure from previous dinners in
its entire aspect

unnatural food it brings.

“The teeth are of particular inter-
est to the anthropologist, for prac-
tically the whole man-ape tree is
based on teeth.” Mr. Krogman main-
tains. “Their peculiar hardness and
position in the bone, enables both
teeth and bone to survive where
other portions of the skeleton will
decay. This is shown by the fact
that ten out of our eleven specimen

1\ /TEMBERS of the three women s organizations on campus have
elected new officers to lead them during the coming year.

The Young Women s Christian association chose a president,
vice-president, secretary, treasurer and undergraduate representative
to direct the work of “developing a Christian spirit; of creating a
sympathetic understanding with foreign students, industrial women,
and those of other groups; and through social and religious activ-
ities to foster friendship among all the women of the University.”

The newly-elected chairman of the Federation of University
Women, of which every woman student on entering the University
automatically becomes a member, will direct the work, the primary
purpose of which is the promotion of the motto—“Friendship, Co-
operation and Vision.

The Women's Athletic association executives—president, vice-
president, secretary, treasurer, advisory board, and representatives
—will guide the work to ‘‘cooperate with the Women’s Department
of Physical Education, for the promotion of the physical and social
activity of the University women.”

These three organizations respectively have as their primary j
aims the furthering of friendship among the women of the Univer-
sity. Each year’s class of graduates detracts from the list of mem-
bers; but each year's entering class adds to th£ list.

Having elected new leaders—women chosen because of their
ability to direct as well as to work—these three organizations pro-
pose to “carry on.” But they, as do all organizations, need co-oper-
ation. Will they get co-operation? o

Edwin Arlington Robinson, has,
according to Miss Aiken ,three types
of poems: character sketches, poems
built around an idea, and narrative
poems with a lyric poem occasionally.
From these types she read “Man
Against the Sky,” which is a poem of •
destiny; “A Souvenir,” and part of
his long poem “Merlin,” which is
built around the Arthurian legends.
He is fond of writing of death and
of the success of failure.

Sigma Nu and Alpha Tau Omega
will meet tonight in the finals for
the intramural championship of the
Universitw. It will he a battle of a
flashy offensive team against a
steady close guarding aggregation.
Both teams have shown a good brand
of basketball all season although
that of the A. T. O.’s has been a
little more outstanding. Doped as
one of the strongest teams from the
beginning of the season they have
come through in fine shape and have
yet to lose a game.

Sigma Nu Springs Upsets

The Sigma Nus won their way into
the finals by several upsets of the
dope but at the present time seemed
to have reached the acme of their
power. Hoey at center plays a won-
derful floor game and is a dead eye
shot. His work has been one of the
features of the tournament and he
is responsible to a great extent for
the Sigma Nu team fighting their
way to the finals. Koerber and Stev-
ens are two dangerous men and are
good for a marker anytime they get
within the foul circle. The team is
a very close guarding organization
and in additional Brignal has the
added advantage of being a very
clever dribbler.

High Scorers

The A. T. O. aggregation enjoys
the reputation of scoring the most
points of any team in the meet. Gor-
den, tiny forward is an excellent shot
at the basket. Kyle Anderson at the
other forward handles the ball in a
sensational manner and his specialty
is long shots

Hinkle, star Maroon three letter

Butler will always be grateful to

WHAT o/IT?

T^MORjiE MORGENSTERN

At last a stray rumor has come
to me about what is being done
about it, but strange as it may seem,
this is a rank error. For the wise
men of the university, having seen
the foundation pit for the field house
dug. are now considering the need
of a field house. This struck me as
strange when I first heard oT it, and
I asked one of the campus oracles
about it. ‘Well,” said he, “they dug
the hole first because the endowment
campaign was not going so hot.
Think you can dope that one out?” I
think 1 can, but, of course, this view
is a bit cynical, and'I am right with

GYM SQUAD MEETS

EASTERN CHAMPIONS

Daniel Hoffer’s celebrated gymnasts
that have tasted but one defeat in the
last five years or so will receive the
most acid of all the so-called “acid
tests” when they meet the Annapolis
turners here on Saturday night. The
Middies who have not lost a dual meet
in about ten years are so good that
they were barred from the Eastern
Inter-collegiate because they were so
good that they made the opposition
look foolish.

The midshipmen have one of the
strongest teams this year and thus far
have cleaned up everybody in the East
and are now seeking new fields to con-
quer. Hoffer will pit his strongest
combination against the invaders and
the Maroons should give a good ac-
count of themselves. Capt. Quinn,
Flexner, Connor, and Davidson will be
the mainstays of the Maroon tumblers
who will attempt to wrest the National
title from the cadets.

The athletic carnival at
Gym this evening is one

of tl\e

ways and means those interested in
getting a field house are selling the
proposition” (these conventions!) to
the aforementioned wise men. All
the athletes of the university, from
Charlestoners to Togo Dygert, will
perform and the spectacle would be
well worth the price of admission,
if there were any price of admission.
The idea of those in charge is to
show the moving minds of the school
that there is a most distressing state
of congestion in the present gym-
nasium, and that therefore a bigger
and better plant—a field house, in
fact—is essential.

So the gym will be all cluttered up
with athletes, near-athletes, and not
so-near athletes. All the boys will
be out dying for the dear old frat-
ernity. I was entered in the high
jump myself Tuesday afternoon, but
I made such an abrupt and painful
descent after my first jump that I
transferred to the 300-yard run on
the spot. “This stuff of dying for
the organization,” I thought, as I
called for the liniment bottle, “is all
right, but ...” Still, there are more
hardy souls than I around this school,
and doubtless they will be willing to
die tonight with the whole-souled ab-
straction of early Christian martyrs.
I should advise you to see them do
it; it may be instructive and It may
help get the field house, but certainly
it wil be funny.

bers, and other features, as told on
page one of today’s Maroon.

However, the events around which
the whole affair is planned, are those
affording the actual athletic compe-
tition between the I-M athletes and
the organizations which they repre-
sent. There are to be sixteen such
events, and they \vill take place at
the following times:

Due to the large number of events
it will be necessary to run off every-
thing on time, and it is for this rea-
son that the Intramural Department
wishes every contestant to be on
deck at least fifteen minutes ahead
of time. Every event is to start ex-
actly at the time and place stated
above, and a very capable staff of of-
ficials will be there to manage the
necessary details characteristic of a
well manipulated meet.

Phi Psi Last Year’s Champ

Phi Kappa Psi, winners in last
year’s Revue, and Sigma Nu will en-
ter the contests this evening with
five points to start with, as a result
of first places in the field events held
last Tuesday. Both of these organ-
izations were well represented in the
preliminaries, and together with
Kappa Sigma and Alpha Delta Phi
looked to be the favorites by their
showings in the preliminaries.

The Phi Psis qualified Laverty in
the 50 yard dash, Duval and Peale
in the 50 yd. low hurdles, their relay
team in the relays, and Duval won
the shot put. The Sigma Nus quali-
fied their team in the relays, and
Koerber won the high jump. Kappa

er and Fellinger to note! Lamb is a
good four forty man and held the
captaincy of the yearlings two years
ago, while Blankley is guarding the
breakstroke affair.

Cups will be presented to the Macs,
winners of the horseshoe tourna-

the Inter-fraternity touchball cham-
pionship, and other champions of
the University. The presentations
will be made as a climax to an eve-
ning of final events in wrestling
and track.

In the afternoon, at 4:45, pictures
will be taken of the Varsity and
Frosh wrestlers, for the Cap and
Gown. All members of these teams
should report at the stadium at the
specified time.

IN WOMEN’S BASKET
INTER-CLASS MEET

The Seniors again took the lead-in
the inter-class championship race yes-
terday afternoon when they defeated
the Juniors 31 to 19 after a hard bat-
tle. The Freshmen pulled a surprise
this same afternoon when they de-
faeted the cocky Sophomores after a
desperate battle with a score of 19 to
16.

This was quite unexpected as this
is the first game they have succeeded
in winning although they have put up
a respectable fight every time. The
finals of the tournament will be played
off next week, after which an honor
team made up of the best players from
every class team will be chosen.

This honor team is then scheduled
to play an alumni and a faculty team
before the season closes.

Minnesota, with Black Rasey doing
a lot of fancy tricks, played a rather
shrewd game for cellar occupants, and,
as a result, presented the Maroons
with a 28 to 23 defeat in their sea-
son’s windup at Bartlett last night.

Thus the record for the year of 1926
for Norgren’s outfit may be summed
up as four victories and eight defeats,
which is not bad when everything is
given weighty consideration. Anyhow,
it is somewhat more respectable ap-
pearing than one record gathered in
1925.

Gophers Pile Up Lead

The first half ended 17-13 in favor
of Minnesota. But it was during the

Besides collecting 13 markers this
black-haired youth did other things to
make himself prominent. His hand-

with that of any other person gracing
the Bartlett floor this season. He
killed considerable valuable time by
bouncing the ball all over the floor
in general and no place in particular.

to commit a foul and the sad part of
it was that that is exactly what hap-

expected out for next year’s team so
that the Maroons will no longer lack
beefy men.

Dear Turk:

I saw the Morris Gest production
yesterday. The LineO’Type calls it a
Miracle to see three hundred silent
women, but imagine any of them tak-
ing no time to powder her nose for
absolutely forty-five minutes.

THE ENGINEER

He romped on mathematics
And calculus and such.

He parlayed French and Latin
And Hindustan and Dutch.

He tackled steam mechanics

And gave it quite a ride,
He was a traction wizard
And he ran a wicked slide.

But though he gnashed his molars
And tore his learned hair,
He couldn’t start a flivver
When frost was in the air.

TALK about ’’alliteration’s artful aid” . . . the
printer certainly raided the ”p” box that trip.
But let that go! The advice is just as serious and
sound as though it were couched in the careful
diction of an English prof.

Just get yourself a jimmy-pipe and fill the
bowl to the brim with Prince Albert. Light up,
and let the first fragrant whiff tell you that no
other tobacco is like P. A.—or can be! Cool
and sweet and fragrant, P. A. has everything a
fellow ever wished for in a smoke.

P. A. can’t bite your tongue or parch your
throat. The Prince Albert process settled that
in P. A.’s freshman year. Get yourself a tidy
red tin of Prince Albert today. The first load-up
will tell you why pipes are so fashionable among
young men today.

And alwayi with every bit of
bite and parch removed by
the Prince Albert proceii.
