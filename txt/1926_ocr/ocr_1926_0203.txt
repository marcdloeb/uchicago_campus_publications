MODERN PROFESSOR
BEATS CONTESTANTS
IN CHARLESTON RACE

Gone is the old-fashioned college
professor, buried behind a pair of horn-
limmed spectacles and a pile of theses
and fortified with a fortgetfulness com-
plex. The modern prof attends cab-
arets instead of philosophy lectures
and wins prizes in Charleston mara-
thons instead of essay contests.

According to the O. A. C. Daily
Barometer, an English instructor in
the Oregon Agricultural college was
recently announced the winner of a
Charleston endurance contest. While
attending a dance at a local hotel, the
instructor won a silver loving cup
when he and his partner managed to
dance continuously for forty-five min-
utes. Their nearest competitors lost
out after forty minutes.

Undergrad. Council
Holds Annual Open

Meeting In Clastics

Members of the Undergraduate
council will hold their traditional open
council today in the Men’s Commons
room in Classics 20 at 3:30. At this
meeting, the first of its kind to be
held this year, all students of the
University may attend.

The Undergraduate council holds an
open meeting once each year, to en-
able any who wish to attend to see
the council in conference.

Important issues that will come be-
fore the council at this meeting con-
cern the Washington Prom, the “All
for Chicago’’ campaign and the In-
vestigation of Women’s Physical Cul-
ture.

“The object of the open council,”
said Charles Anderson, president, “is
to invite the comment of the student
body and give them an opportunity to
see just what the function and pro-
ceedure of the Undergraduate council
is. The interest which the issues to be
considered have aroused among the
students should bring a large represen-
tation to the meet.”

SENIORSVOTE

ON CLASS GIFT

To Decide on Insurance
Proposal in Chapel

Voting upon their class gift to the
University, the seniors will choose or
reject the proposed endowment insur-
ance fund tomorrow at their weekly
chapel service.

The ballots, which will be used, have
the following printed on them: “I fa-
vor the proposed endowment plan (as
outlined on the reverse side) and
hereby pledge myself to support it to
the extent of one $250 policy,” and “I
do not favor the above plan.” The
result will be determined by a major-
ity of votes either in favor of or again-
st the proposition. Those who do not
regularly attend chapel will have bal-
lots mailed to them.

Charles F. Axelson, *09, of the
Board of Trustees first sugested this
plan: 300 policies at $250 each would
constitute an initial gitt of $75,000 to
the University, each policy payable an-
nually, $12 a payment. If the donor
dies before the end of a twenty year
period, the amount of his policy goes
to the University.

SMITH PLEADS
FOR TOLERANT

CHURCH VIEWS

Broadcasts Opinions on Con-
troversy Between Re-
ligion and Science

Recognition of intellectual progress
by religious leaders and a more tol-
erant attitude on the part of scientists
toward the spiritual verities, will go
far toward reconciling the apparent
conflict between science and religion,
asserted Prof. Gerald Birney Smith of
the University divinity school in a
radio talk last night from The Daily
News station, WMAQ.

“The spectacular Scopes trial in
Tennessee last summer brought into
vivid contrast two ways of thinking,”
Prof. Smith said. Religious people
have long been accustomed to go to
the Bible for information. (On the
other hand, science seeks to observe
facts and draw conclusions. _

Points to Old Theories

The speaker cited modern acceptance
of the Qopernican astronomical the-
ories as an instance of a radical change
in religious beliefs to conform with
new scientific discoveries. Four hun-
dred years ago it was heresy to believe
that the earth moved around the sun.

“When religious leaders learn that
progress in religious thinking is as de-
sirable as progress in thinking in any
other realm, the main reason for an-
tagonism between science and religion
will have disappeared.” Prof. Smith
predicted.

Y. W. Committee
to Serve Tea at

Inter-Hall Vodil

Tea will be served at the Interhall
Vodvil produced under the auspices of
the Campus Community committee of
Y. W. C. A. to be held Wednesday.
Feb. 10 at 3:30 in the theater of Ida
Noyes hall, according to the decision
of the Y. W. C. A. first cabinet. This
tea will be under the direction of the
Conference and Church Cooperation
committee, and it will be served be-
fore and during the vaudeville, and
will consist of homemade cakes and
tea.

It is a tradition of the committee to
take charge of the tea, as it has carried
on this activity for the past two years.
“We think that it adds a great deal
to the affair to have tea served,” said
Virginia Brinnall. chairman of the
Conference and Church Cooperation
committee, “and are very glad to be
able to cooperate with the Campus
Community committee in making the
affair a success.”

The program of the Vodvil will be
a series of pantomines, based on A.
A. Milne’s book of poems “When We
Were Very Young.'

Home Economics Club

Entertains At Dinner

Representatives of Home Econom-
ical departments of various colleges
will be guests of the Home Economics
club at a dinner tomorrow at 6:30 in
the refrectory of Ida Noyes hall.

Miss Edna White, director of the
Merrill-Palmer school of Detroit will
be the principal speaker. Other speak-
ere will be Miss Marion Talbot, Miss
Francis Swain of the Chicago Normal
school and Dr. Katherine Blunt, chair-
man of the Home Economics depart-
rticiil.

Now Will You
Buy Tickets to

The Playfest?

“Could you—1 mean would you—
write us a little Blurb for The Play-
fest?" the Dramatic Association’s de-
mon publicity agent asked Mr. Percy
Holmes Boynton.

“Put that in writing and I’ll consider
it,” came back Mr. Percy Holmes Boyn-
ton of the preceding paragraph. “How
many words can I have?”

“O just one sentence, 250 words, or
what have you?’’

“Both.”

And here it is—Mr. Boynton’s letter
—in 250 words and one sentence:
My dear Moore:

If 1 were trying to persuade any one
to buy tickets for the Dramatic Asso-
ciation programs of Friday and Satur-
day evenings of this week—at Mandel
Hall—at 8:30—Tickets $.75, and $1.00—
which of course I am not, since every-
one knows that I haven’t the slightest
interest in the drama or the Dramatic
Association or students in general or
the University Settlement or the Kind-
ergarten, but if the socialization process
had been completed in me and 1 were
interested in any or all of these matters
and were trying to promote public in-
terest in them, and ticket selling—$.75
and $1.00—why I'd say that the burden
of proof was on the people who were
not planning to come rather on people
like me, or like what I would be if I
wert1 doing this, Iwcause last year's pro-
gram was such a success and people were
so enthusiastic about it, and the actors
who were appearing this year are so
good, and the cooperation of everyone
is so all-starrish from Professor Vood-
ward and Frank O'Hara and ^ois Rus-
sell and Stew (or is it Stu or Stoo)
Covert and Professor David (if rumor
is correct) and that's boy who's such a
whiz at scenery, and the other one who
does costuming when he isn’t playing
any one of a half dozen musical instru-
ments, up and down the line to the inde-
fatigable Trebow 3-4 wh (There goes
that 3-4 sign that’s always butting in
where I mean a 3-4 !!! I mean, where
1 mean a— but it's reminder that you
can get in for 3-4 if you haven't a whole
dollar) who now I've forgotten what
that wh was going to start) and that
just proves that I wouldn’t l>e much
of a salesman if I did try, particularly
as you said I could only have 250 words,
and that isn’t room enough for one sen-
tence in my new rhythmic prose style—

ZETA BETES ACQUIRE
NEW CHAPTER HOUSE
ON WOODLAWN AVE.

Zeta Beta Tau today announced the
purchase of a new home, formerly the
residence of Dr. M. M. Portis, ’located
at 5749 Woodlawn Avenue.

The building is ideally constructed
and located for a fraternity house.

Zeisler, the noted pianiste, th^ house
boasts of a living room that .is a verit-
able ball-room, capable of seating 180
persons. Miss Zeisler gave her concerts
in this room, playing from i raised '(dat-
form perfectly suited for a dance or-
chestra.

A dining room, breakfast room, ser-
vants’ quarters, butler’s pantry, and kit-
chen complete the ground floor.

On the second floor are five l»<4r|>oms
furnished for family use, four baths, and
a glass-enclosed sleeping porch on which
the Zetes hope to accomodate twenty
men. The basement includes an indoor
golf course and gymnastic appafjflis, as
well as facilities for storage and hiwdry.

Transactions for the acquisition of the
house were handled by the firin of ling-
er, Wilhartz and Hirsch. Moaris Land-

E. Green, National director of Red
Cross information in a lecture which
will be given today at 4:30 in Harper

Dr. Green, who is internationally
known as an author, editor, and world
lecturer is an authority on the sub-

“Bub” Henderson, famous captain of
the 1925 Football team walked
into Paul Cullom’s room at the
walked into Paul Cullom’s room at the
Phi Psi house the other night and ask-
ed for some collar buttons. It seemed
that Mr. Henderson was dressing for a
dance, and had nothing wherewith to
connect hi s shirt and collar.

Cullom gave him two gold collar
buttons of simple design. Henderson
thanked him, and was on the point of
leaving the room when he noticed some
Yeast Foam tablets.

“Great things, these Yeast Foam tab-
lets,” said Mr. Henderson. He picked
two up in the other hand, and walked
out.

Some few minutes later the famous
football player returned with a pained
expression on his face. It developed
that he had made a mistake, confusing
the collar buttons and the tablets.

Mr. Henderson’s present condition ie
not known.

GIVE DINNER TO
HEADS OF CLUBS

Leaders of Campus Societies
Dine at Hutchinson

Presidents of campus organizations,
other than fraternities and women’s
clubs, together with the other major
officers of the organizations, will meet
with Dean Boucher in Hutchinson,
cafe at 0:15 next Thursday. This
meeting is to be the first step in the
organization of a new society.

Questioneers will me filled out by
the persons present, and all data per-
taining to the character or purpose of
the club will be given. The ensuing
campaign will cover two weeks.

“There are a great many worthy
campus clubs and organizations which
the student body at large knows very
little about,” said Thomas Mulroy,
chairman of the dinner, last night. “We
feel that if the students who have no
group connections knew of the value
of these organizations they would be
interested.”

1 his is the firlt step in the organ-
ization of a social unit to include all
persons active in the University, it is
the first attempt to bring about a hap-
pier, better acquainted undergraduate
body of the unaffiliated.

STRAIGHT A’S IN

FALL JU ARTER
Recorder’s Office Finds Wo-
men Are Better Scholars

Than Men

Four hundred and seventy-seven stu-
dents at the University maintained
Phi Beta Kappa averages during the
last quarter, it was announced yester-
day by Walter A. Payne, recorder and
examiner. Such an average means that
the student must do college work that
is within eleven per cent of perfection.

The women students held a slight
margin over the men, figures show.
The group was divided between 241
women and 236 men. However, there
were thirty-four men in the A, or al-
most perfect class, and thirty-two
women. Eighty-five women and eigh-
ty-eight men averaged sixteen grade
points, or two A grades and one B
for three college courses. In the four-
teen grade point class, signifying two
B grades and one A, there were 124
women and 114 men.

Only 2.91 Per Cent Flunk

lOf 9,549 grades recorded at the
University, about half of them were
B or better, representing about ninety
per cent perfect work. Only 2.91 per
cent of the grades were failures. Statis-
tics show further that 14.03 per cent
were “straight A” or as near perfect
work as can be recorded.

Undergraduates in activities such as
dramatics, publications and student
government which are not part of the
regular college work, and for which
time must be spent apart from the pur-
suit of studies^ scored high in scholas-
tic rating. A survey of the grades
made by students in publications and
dramatic productions, announced by
Frank H. O’Hara, director of under-
graduate activities, stows that the gen-
eral average for these students was
almost B, or a numerical score of 3.42,
as against the two points necessary
for eligibility to take part in such ac-
tivities.

Actors Lead Activities

The campus actors led the field,
while the staffs of the college publica-
tions trailed with a slightly lower aver-
age, Mr. O’Hara stated. The Circle,
undergraduate highbrow magazine, to-
taled a high grade, but members of
The Daily Maroon staff pulled the
average for the publications to a low-
er figure.

HOW WILL YOU HAVE YOUR
SHEEPSKIN?

A question in the technique of convocations has arisen. Shall the
President on graduation day still hand each candidate for a
degree a diploma bearing the candidate’s own name? Or shall
he, for greater convenience, hand each a dummy, a blank roll of pa-
per, to be exchanged for a diploma later? Or shall diplomas be
abolished altogether, as an unnecessary monkey-wrench in the
works.

The President of the University of Chicago has always followed
the tradition (unique among universities of this size) of giving each
candidate his actual diploma as the procession crosses the platform.
To make this procedure possible, the college marshals and aides
arrange and keep the candidates in perfect alphabetical order. Some-
times (not often) slips have occurred in this arrangement, hence,
disorder in the procession, or the wrong diploma for somebody.

It has been proposed that the custom be changed, and that the
President hand down from his throne either dummy diplomas or no
diplomas at all. The latter alternative, it is argued, would save time
and eliminate a dull procedure. Either alternative would avoid
confusion and the chance of error.

The adherents to tradition reply that confusion and error are rare
and that the giving of actual diplomas by the President does not
bore the candidates or the audience, but rather helps to impress the
more forcefully. We see the President all too seldom, in our four
years here. Despite the time the ceremony takes, Mandel hall is us-
ually packed for convocation. Convocation, they add, is not an
affair for efficiency experts, a thing to be hurried through.

If this question interests you (since you yours.elf may, some day,
graduate) The Daily Maroon would like to know your views on it.

A dent activities and still secure good grades has been demonstrat-
ed in a recent survey made here of the scholastic ratings of persons
with such pursuits outside the class-room. To be eligible for activ-
ities, a student must have at least two grade points; yet .the general
average of grade points as revealed in the survey was 3.42.

The dramatic association led with an average of almost four
grade points, while publications secured almost a three and one-half
point average. Many of these students, at this rate, will be eligible
for Phi Beta Kappa membership.

If undergraduate activities averages can show higher than frat-
ernity and club grades, then is there ample proof of general ability
of students to participate in aetviities and still not lose that thing
for which they primarily come to school—the pursuit of learning.

To the Editor:

I think the plan to publish in the
Maroon the names of all those who
got Phi Beta Kappa grades last quar-
ter is just fine and dandy. Don’t you
think it would be awfully nice, and en-
couraging, too, to reward them in a
more tangible fashion—such as gold
stars pasted in the course hooks of
those who got three A’s. silver stars
for two A’s and a B, and just plain
pink or blue stars for one A and two
B’s? And then the deans might write
little congratulatory comments across
the books. For example—on a book
with three A’s, “Hurray for you,”
or “three cheers for Bessie,” (or Ben-
nie. as the case might be): on the
others, “Come ’leven,” (not of course,
eleven grade points) “You’re getting
there,” or “clap hands, here comes . . .
Also, sometime during the quarter, the
hard workers might be excused from

their Friday classes.

The realization of this suggestion
might be rather expensive. However,
those with three A’s might be present-
ed with carefuly expurgated editions of
“Pigrim’s Progress,” or “The Wide,
Wide Word,” and the others with op-
ies of “Stcdy Heps.” At any rate, a
special blessing could be said in chapel
for those with Phi Beta Kappa grades.

Yours for encouraging good schol-
arship,

HAWKEYE CREW

Wolverine Defeat Stings
Natators On For
Iowa Meet

By G. A. Florez

With the lingering sting of the swim
team’s defeat at the hands of the
sturdy Michigan tank-men ,the Ma-
roon swim crew is pointing hard for
the oncoming Iowa meet. The trip to
the nest of the Hawks is the second
consecutive away-from home dual meet
and the MacGillivray hackers are do-
ing thejr utmost to keep from repeat-
ing their first out of town attempt.

Redfield Improves

The timing matches have discov-
ered tremendous improvement in Bob
Redfield’s forty yard sprint, which will
add to the strength of Captain Noyes’
relay team.

Noyes and Rittenhouse will have a
hard fight on their fins when they
splash against McClintock and Stew-
art of the Corn Stater’s squad. Both
of the swimming Hawks are experienc-
ed in the art of water cutting having
been considered threats in last year’s
Conference.

Ashton To Star

Ashton will be the individual honor
trotter for the lowaus jn defending
the backstroke event and will give Jel-
inek something to think about during
the week. Hamell or Kaats will supply
additional strength to the local Var-
sity, in this event.

Jerry Greenburg and Charlie Lane
are to furnish keen competition for
Lambert the long swim whizz for the
Hawkeyes.

Killibrew and Trager are the out-
standing satellites for the out state
team in the fancy diving performance,
but with the Maroon invading Gallaxy
hopes are likely to fade away before
the initial dives have been ac-
complished.

Mygdal Recovers

K. Mygdal has recovered from his
optical injury and is turning the tank
liquid into thin vapor with his repeat-
ed practice times. Diamond veteran
hreastroker is expected to back Myg-
dal and place in the two hundred yard
affair with ease.

Gilchrist, former water basketball
artist is showing promise in the forty
yards and is expected to play fourth
man on the relay machine.

Good Grades Make

Tumbler Ineligible!

It is a well known fact that grades
ruin the career of many good ath-
letes and that it is particularly true
here at the University of Chicago
where it is exceptional that a team
goes through the season without los-
ing some good men because of in-
eligibility. However over at Iowa
City they are facing an entirely op-
posite situation.

Under a new system, grades above
a “B" give extra grade points and en-
able a man to graduate more quickly
than formerly. As a result Breck-
inridge, captain of the Hawk Gym
team and perhaps tire best tumbler in
the conference will be ineligible for
further competition after February
1st. This is the first case on record
of good grades forcing an athlete
out.

If there are any smart men in the

have been going to track meets for
many, many years, and I haven’t been
able to dope the answer out yet. I’ve
seen two-milers come and two-milers
go, and I've seen them go 'round and
'round, but I've never been able to

Three Buckeye Gridmen Enact

“Musketeers ”On College Campus

By Victor Roterus

There is a real life enactment of Du-
mas’ famous novel. “The Three Mus-
keteers” being presented daily on the
Ohio State campus. Two state foot-
ball stars, Elmer Marek and Leo Uri-
dil, and Ed. Dostal, scholar wonderful,
are the students whose comradeship
resembles that of Porthos, Aramis, and
Athos of the days when men were
chivalrous knights and women were
ladies.

The trio have so far all treaded the
same paths in shaping their careers.
For the past half-score of years they
have continually brushed shoulders
during the performance of their vari-

Close Friends

The close friendship had

its

which
excel-

origin

in a picturesque city in the state made
famous by the fact that from it the
west begins and that in it the tall
corn grows. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, serv-
ed bring the three together in their
present enduring friendship. They sat
in the same classrooms in both the
public and high schools. During their
regime at the later institution Marek
and Uridil went on the role of honor
as athletes while Dostal’s name graced
it through his prowness in wrestling
with books.

Five famous ex-Maroon cage
stars proved last night that they
were too big, too tough, and were
too good football men for Chicago’s
frosh eagers and handed them a 22-
14 beating. Pat Page, Paul Hinkle,
Fritz Crisler, Birkhoff, and Dickson
all members of championship teams
in their playing days slaughtered
the yearlings. Birkhoff’s uncanny
eye, Page’s bullet like passes that
sped the full length of the floor,
Dickson’s “jump in shots,” and the
vicious guarding of Fritz and
“Tony” crushed the clever freshmen
passing attack.

Birkhoff was high point man with
four buckets and a free throw. Gist
starred for the green shirts with 3
beautiful baskets.

Chicago—	Butler—	
Sackett	RF	Nipper
Zimmerman	LF	Chadd
Alyea	C	Wakefield
McDonough	RG	Harker
Hoerger	LG	Keach

By Irving Goodman

Pat Page’s strategy and some poor
shooting by the Maroons was «,1 that
saved Butler from receiving a neat,
trimming at the hands of the Maroons.
As it was, the Indianapolis eagers
pulled through with a 20 to 18 win.

Chicago started off in sensational
fashion by running up an 8-0 score be-
fore the half was ten minutes gone.
McDonough contributed two pretty
buckets and Sackett a neat ringer.
Then the wily Page altered his sys-
tem by switching to a man to man
defense and following the Maroons
beneath their own basket so as to
thwart the Norgren system of drib-
bling to the middle of the floor.

The strategy worked and immediate-

ly Butler got going. Wakefield, the
clever Hoosier center found the range
and with the aid of free throws evened
the score to 12-12 at the half.

The second half started slowly with
Butler playing a waiting game. With
McDonough, who twisted an ankle, re-
moved from the game, the Pagemen
soon jumped into the lead. Nipper and
Wakefield of the visitors resorted to
a dribbling game and managed to get
fouls called on them.

Chicago never got started in the
second half making, only two field
goals during this period.

Wakefield led the scoring'for the
visitors with 3 baskets and four free
throws while Zimmerman was high
point man for the Maroons with two
field goals and a pair of free throws.

Statistics of the game readily show
the weak spot of the Maroons. Out of
forty-nine shots at the basket the Ma-
roons sunk but six baskets. Butler
took advantage of the tods caging ten
free throws.

Water Polo Squad

Doped to Beat Iowa

The polo team swears vengeance af-
ter their under dog role of a fortnite
back and has been out doing itself
during the past week’s practices. With
the advice of Coach MacGillivray and
the help of Captain Petrolowitz the
poloers are expected to end the fray
of this Saturday in the lead.

Iowa plays a good clean brand of
Water Polo, and with Chicago boast-
ing the same, a real exhibition of the
new game is expected. The Chicago
men are given the edge however, be-
cause of a more scientific attack than
is used in the Corn Stater campus.

Captain Petrolowitz is depending on
Hall, Krogh, Gilchrist, White, Howe.
Jelinek, Gordon and Greenberg to end
the fray outpointing the opposing
Iowan crew.

Hall, the giant goal tender is taking
all the responsibility for the Maroons
in guarding the scoring posts, and if
his play is of the same caliber as that
shown in past contests, the Hawks will
be considered mighty lucky if able to
score at all.

Over at Bartlett Gym the two-mile
run is twenty-four times around the
track. The mere thought of the race
makes me dizzy, hut it doesn’t even
feaze the .boys who run it. There
seems to me to be something rather
futile in the race. Apropos of this
idea, there is the illuminating remark
once made by my good friend Mr. Al-
bon Holden, portly editor of the Big
Ten Weekly. “They go around and
around,” said Mr. Holden on some
nearly forgotten ocasion, “twenty-four
times, and when they get done they’re
in the same place they started.”

No doubts ever plague the mind of
the two-miler, however; he does his
work in conscientious and workman-
like fashion, without ever asking why
or wherefore. Every night he goes
out and grinds out a couple of miles;
he pays particular attention to his
diet, abstaining carefully from ban-
ana pie, fig newtons, and other foods'
not calculated to keep him in top
shape. He never complains at the Spar-
tan rigours of training which his race
imposes on him. He lives the simple
life all week, and then on Saturday he
is allowed to go out and run his twen-
ty-four laps against other collegians.
The reward for his pains is a dull
drumning back of his ears and a rather
sea-sickish feeling in the pit of his
stomach. But that is enough for him;
he is satisfied. “The glory of the
thing,” he says, “is all the reward I
ask.” And then he looks self-sacri-
ficing and noble, and calls for some
kind friend to use the stomach-pump,
or roll him over a barrel.

I was at a track meet in Bartlett
Gym not so very long ago. The two-
mile race started out. “Twenty-three
laps to go!” bawled out Tom Eck
as the boys came around after run-
ning the first lap. "Twenty-three yer-
sclf!” howled back the athlete who
was leading the pack as he went by.
Now, this was certainly eccentric con-
duct; in anyone but a two-miler it
would have occasioned considerable
comment. But such things are ex-
cused in a two-miler; they are often
the least of his peculiarities.

It would not, I say, have attracted

HOFFER’S GYMNASTS
ENGAGE ILLINOIS IN
FIRST BIG TEN MEET

Dfn Hoffer’s versatile Gymnasts
open their Big Ten campaign here on
Friday night when they meet the
strong squad and have their hopes set
for a Conference Title.

The Maroons, as a result of their
impressive victory over the Milwaukee
Y. M. C. A. turners, are the favorites
to cop. Hoffer’s teams have always
been skilled in this sport and the gym
title has been practcally a Maroon
monopoly for the last fifteen years.
Capt. Jerry Quinn, Flexner, Davidson.
Connor and Nelson will bear the brunt
of the acrobatic work. Most of the
men are sophomores and this will he
an opportunity to test their ability with
Big Ten opponents for the first time.

Coach Merrill’s fencers will wind
up the evening when they meet the
Illinois swordsman in what, promises
to be an interesting duel. The Ma-
roon fencers though green are expect-
ed to give a good account of them-
selves.

With five Chicago teams due to
compete on Friday and Saturday, Ma-
roon athletes face one of the busiest
week ends of the winter season. The
basketball team after its last minute
defeat of Ohio Saturday night will go
to Columbus to play a return game
with the Buckeyes. Ohio State will
be out for revenge and with its two
stellar scorers, Cunningham and
Dempsey, in form is liable to reverse
the decision of last week.

On Friday night The Illinois Gym
and fencing team will clash with Coach
Hoffer’s Tumblers in Bartlett Gym-
nasium. The squad this year under the
leadership of Jerry Quinn has develop-
ed into a very well rounded aggrega-
tion and is giving promise of round-
ing into a championship team.

The swimmers will leave Saturday
for Iowa City to combat the Hawks in

Tankmen are anxious to avenge

The
their

defeat at the hands of the Wolverines
last week. The water polo team with
only one defeat to its credit will also
combat the lowans^and will endeavor
to show a better offense than the one
displayed at Ann Arbor when they
were held to two goals.

Saturday night will also see Coach
Vorres men in action when the Min-
nesota wrestling team will come here
for a match. Although the team is of
unknown calibre, Voores promises it
is very strong in most departments
and the meet will be a real battle.

any undue attention had the athlete
not acted even more oddly the second
time around. I was sitting at the south
end of the track, together with a lot
of other spectators, and as the leader
came by us the second time he called
out, “Has anybody- got a chew of
gum?” There wasn’t time to reply,
but some wit demanded, “What flav-
or?" on the third lap. “Juicy Fruit."
answered the two-miler, as he round-
ed out the fourth lap. “Sorry: we ain’t
got none.” replied the sideline spokes-
man as the boys came by the next
time. “Aw. heck!” said the two-miler
at the end of the sixth lap. and then
for the next eighteen times around he
maintained a clamlike silence. After
the race was over, the only thing he’d

were inseparable and so it was that
the eternal triangle hopped off the

They promptly selected the same
fraternity and arranged for the same
classes in the School of Commerce
and Journalism. This fall Marek and
Uridil were both stringers of the foot-
ball squad, and Marek’s work on Stagg

sundry 33,000 that witnessed the epic
struggle staged that day. As yet there
are no indications that there will be a
breakage of the tie that binds.

This incident is only illustrative of
what goes on every day in two-mile
circles. It is such things as this which
lead me to shake off my habitual leth-
argy and demand. “Why is a two-
miler" Perhaps there's material in
that query for a congressional inves-
tigation; perhaps the solution is so
simple as that offered me by a friend
recently: “They’re cracked."
