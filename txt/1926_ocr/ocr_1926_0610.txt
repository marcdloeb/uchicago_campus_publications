FANS MUST CHEER

BY RADIO, DECREE
BIG TEN OFFICIALS

Any college student who spends
his week-ends travelling around the
country following a football team is
a menace to the educational program
of his school. His perambulating ac-
tivities must be stopped for the sake
of the welfare of his school, accord-
ing to a decision reached at a joint
meeting of faculty and athletic di-
rectors of the Big Ten, held recently
at Iowa City.

The enthusiasm that causes stu-
dents to migrate by the thousand in
order to watch a two-hour game is
abnormal and might be termed a
“Football hysteria.” This consider-
ation caused the conference to pass
a recommendation that this cross-
country movement be stopped by
force.

If this recommendation is adapt-
ed, Mandel hail will be recruited on
Saturdays durirng the Fall season
to house football fans and students
of the University who will spend
their Saturday afternoons patiently
waiting for the announcer to tell
them the results of the games.

OLD CLOTHES BOX
AT COBB IS READY

It’s old clothes now. The settle-
ment wants them. Bring them
around and drop them in the box
in front of Cobb han and they will
be placed in the possession of pov-
erty-stricken children out in that
often h^ard of but little known
country back of the yards.

This is the annual call of the
University settlement house. Every
year when the students are pack-
ing up to leave school the Y. M.
C. A. begins its task of urging the
campus to part with its battle
worn raiment.

The idea of collecting clothes
for the needy began back in 1916
during the World War. At that
time the whole world was sym-
pathizing with the pitiful condi-
tion of Armenia. The campus was
urged to help out. It began col-
lecting old clothes.

The custom has continued ever
since. Now it is a thoroughly es-
tablished custom. Well, after all
that, lets drag out the old duds
and fork them over.

‘FINAL’ PHOENIX
ON SALE TODAY

Examination Number Con-
tains Satire On Quizzes

What might appear on and in an
exam booklet comprises the contents
of the “Final Number” of the Phoe-
nix, the campus humour magazine l
which will be distributed today.

The frontispiece together with the
cover, the editor prefers to be seen
and not described. Needless to say
they are gentle satire on the closing
days of the quarter. “Mother Goose
Rimes for sophisticated children” are
the first items to greet the reader.
They are followed by a short story,
“Tina” written by Fred Handschy.

Two drawings by Hogarth are re-
produced and made illustrative of
campus life. A third drawing is also
printed entitled ‘First Night at Con-
vocation.” In it nineteen seniors are
represented.

“Voltaire” a play in burlesque of
the style of Bernard Shaw follows
and is set up around a fragment
called “The last letter of a Co-ed.”

The issue contains a page of draw-
ings by Langdon Caldwell Dewey,
under the heading “Holier Than
Thou.” Running comments beneath
the cuts carry out the title. “Final
Numbers,” a two page spread of il-
lustrations by staff artists is the final
feature of importance in this num-
ber.

Although Handschy was reluctant
to make this statement, he finally
said to us: “I am sure that this ‘Final
Number’ of the Phoenix is really the
best number we have published.”
And upon looking it over, we agreed.

PUBLISH PICTURE OF
GRADUATING WOMEN

Senior women of the University
will see themselves reflectd in the
rotogravure section of the Sunday’s
Tribune. The picture was taken in
Hutchinson court several weeks ago
by a staff photographer. It will be
printed in colors, and copies of it
may be seen on the Official Bulletin
boards of the University.

Publishing pictures of the graduat-
ing women of the universities is in ac-
cordance with the new policy of the
Tribune and Sunday’s pictures will
be the first to appear.

Graduating Class I UNDERGRADUATE i

Breakfasts Next
Monday Morning

Plans for the 1926 Senior Break-
fast were announced today by Cath-
erine Campbell, class vice president.
The event is scheduled for 11:30 Mon-
day morning in Ida Noyes cloister,
with tickets on sale for 50c.

Among the entertainers for the af-
fair are Clyde Keutzer, Don McGin-
nis, and other “Wallie” stars. Fred

Von
few
tral
who

Ammon is also expected to do a
turns on his accordian. Orches-
din is promised to the graduates
attend. The breakfast is a con-

vocational affair, and is traditional to
all universities.

“We expect 150 or 200 seniors to
attend the breakfast,” said Miss
Campbell. “It is an integral part of
Senior week activities and the ?om-
mittee promises a great time for the
guests. The occasion falls to the lot
of a college student only once, and
every senior who can possibly get
there is obliged to come.”

The breakfast follows immediately
after the junior-senior baseball game.
Following the breakfast the upper-
classmen will again meet in Harper
court, this time for the formal pre-
sentation of the Senior gavel by Al-
len Miller, president of ’26, to John

Howe, president of ’27.

Tickets for the morning feart
procurable from Miss Campbell
Charles Anderson.

Phi Psis Pull
New One; Give

Party On Lake

“Oh for the life of a saiior boy,”
say the Phi Psi’s as they proceed to
make the final arrangements for their
spring party on the 16th.

When looking for something novel,
besides white trou and blue coat,
some bright lad suggested a party
on a lake steamer. The idea sound-
ed good and as a result the boys with
their partners will set sail on the
16th for Gary and other foreign
ports.

And for music the boys have sched-
uled Dave Payton and his orchestra.
While Dave is not new he is certainly
novel. In fact the Phi Psis think hisi
gang is so “hot” that they have had
them at all of their parties since the
first of the year.

STUDENTS DISCUSS
RACE PROBLEMS AT

YOUTH CONFERENCE

Examination of the race problem

Relations,” Saturday, at 10:30. Other
speakers include Walter White,
author of a number of books dealing
with race problems, and William
Dunn of the Workers Community
Party of America.

The meetings will be conducted
largely as Round Table discusions.

WORK OF YEAR!

Ice Cream and Cake Adds;

To Attractiveness of
Last Meeting

By Leonard Bridges

Well, at the meeting of the

Un-

dergraduate Council held yesterday
in Classics ice cream was served.
And so the governing student body
completed its year’s work.

Not only did they serve ice cream
— they even went so far as to invite
the Maroon reporter who had been
hanging hungrily ’round the door to
come and feed with them. This com-
pletely bridged the gap which has so
long existed between the two or-
ganizations. No longer do the lead-
ers of the Council and the editors
of the Maroon exchange hard looks
when they pass one another on the
campus.

Domestic Atmosphere

The reporter noticed that a friend-
ly spirit dominated the meeting. As
President Bennett cut the ice cream
and cake (which, by the way, he
provided) Messrs. Hagey and Miller
made several sarcastic but hardly
cutting remarks about President Ben-

in-

n tt’s domestic possibilities. Miss
Burtis, secretary of the Council,
| laughed, accompanied by John Howe.

But the Maroon reporter was not
the only guest at the meeting. Miss
Jane Louise Hibbard, niece to Mem-
ber Cooke, was also entertained. Ten
years age Miss Hibbard’s mother was
a member of the council. Ex-
perts say that the Council entertain-
ed the young lady, who denies the
statement that she’s only six years
old, in order to create an interest
in the Council among the younger
generation. Some of them say that
it’s merely an attempt to make the
Council a family affair.

ALUMNAE MEET AT

placed on sale at one dollar and a
half. Reservations may be made by

Domingo, which is in turn midway

the area of the country is only a lit-
tle over ten thousand square miles,
it is one of the most thickly peopled
agricultural regions of the world.
The population is almost entirely
composed of negroes, there being less

FREEDOM AND GUIDANCE

ANE of the things we must learn in college is the right use of free-
” dom. In high school we needed close guardianship; in after-
life we shall have to take care of ourselves—as much as society will
let us take care of ourselves. College is the place to make the
change.

The Activities—the production of shows, the publishing of
newspapers, etc.—provide one field where the college may intro-
duce us to freedom.

The work of the activities is creative; it often amounts to
something; and it is done on the student’s own initiative. The prob-
lems of the Activities are something like the problem of real life.
There are political maneuvers to use and to fight against; there
are business policies to form and follow; there are workers to
organize; there is a finished product to sell. These confront you
whether you are publishing The Phoenix or The Saturday Evening
Post, whether you are leading the Washington Prom or the Repub-
lican Party. In the Activities, then, the college student may well
be weaned from parents and high-school principals, and learn
to do the work that parents and principals can not do for him.

How can a university get this service in the fullest measure '
from the Activities of its students? Shall it leave the students to
work out such affairs unguided and unwatched? Then the students
will lose the benefit of their elders’ experience and ideas. Profes-
sors, or deans, or directors (whatever they happen to be called)
can help Activities just as much as they help studies. Such men have
seen many college papers published and many college plays pro- '
duced. They will serve as a reservoir. They will absorb the ex-
perience of one college generation, and pass it on to the next. They
can do still more. They can encourage, and even inspire, their
pupils. Under a true leader, the student will take a genuine in-1
terest in his job. He will realize that it is more than “an honor,’’
a title for his list in the year book. He will realize that the honor
of the job and (what is more) its education depend upon his per-1
formance of the job. He will always seek improvements—a staff
more efficiently organized, a better finished product; a more artistic
show, a more vigorous and more truthful newspaper.

To arouse such an interest, and such an energy, is the job of a
director of student activities. To build up a deta’led system of
rules, and to enforce them in detail, is not his job.

There must be rules, of course. But the rules of college activ-
ities must be flexible. Details must never stand in the way of im-
provement. A new idea may be rejected because it is unwise, but
never because it is against the rules. But how can we decide wheth- |
er an idea is wise or not? That is the job of the director of activ- j
ities. That is what the college man must learn; and that is what
college must teach him.

The country has been controlled by
the American marines since 1915.
During 1914 and the first part of
1915, the American government tried
to induce the Haitian government to
sign a treaty which would give to the
Americans the control over the col-
lection of customs and the adminis-
tration of the Haitian finances. The
reasons why we made this request
are not thoroughly clear since the
Haitians were meeting the interest
on their foreign debt which was held
in France and were in arrears only
in the matter of certain amoritization
payments. The attempts by the
American government to negotiate
such a treaty were, however, repulsed
by the Haitian government.

On July 27, 1915, a revolution broke
out in Port-au-Prince, the capital of
Haiti. The president, Gwillaume
Sam, was forced to leave the presi-
dential palace and was compelled to
take refuge in the French legation.
Before leaving the palace, however,
he apparently ordered the command-
ant of the prison to kill all his poli-
tical enemies who had been impris-
oned. The Commandant of the pris-
on, General Oscar, then went from
cell to cell with a troop of soldiers
and shot 164 persons in all. The news
of this massacre so enraged the peo-
ple of Port-au-Prince that they broke
into the French legation and killed
President Sam. They then dismem-
bered the body and paraded through
the streets of Port-au-Prince with it.
At this juncture an American battle-
ship appeared in the harbor under
the command of Admiral Caperton.
Marines were landed and order re-
stored in the city. The Americans
then called a meeting of Congress to
elect a new president. They inter-
viewed the various candidates and de-
cided to support Senator Dartigue-
nace. The Americans then exerted
their influence to elect Senator Darti-
guenave and he was accordingly
chosen president.

Immediately upon the election of
President Dartiguenave, the Ameri-
can representatives presented him
with a treaty which granted to the
Americans not only the power of col-
lecting the customs and administer-
ing the finances of Haiti, but also the
control over the Haitian gendarmerie.
This force was to be manned by the
Haitians but officered by Americans
appointed by the President of the
United States. The control over pub-
lic works and sanitation was also
granted to the Americans. A vague
clause was included stating that the
Americans would help to preserve or-
der in the country, and the Amer-
icans have used this clause to author-
ize their maintaining a force of ma-
rines in the country during the last
decade. Curiously enough, no clause
concerning the control of education or
the courts was put into the treaty.
It is said the American officials forgot
about these two services. At any
event, they are still under Haitian
control.

After some delay, the President and
the Foreign Minister of Haiti signed
this treaty but in order that it be
legal, it was also necessary to secure
the consent of the Haitian congress.

The University of Illinois is in-
stalling, at more or less stupendous
expense, a loud-speaker system in
their new stadium. Thus, I proclaim,
the commercialization of football
continues merrily and with huge
profit to all concerned.

The purpose of this system, I con-
tinue, according to the press, is to
explain to the spectators what is oc-
curring upon the field. But, you
say, this is ridiculous. For surely
there is not, upon the quadrangles,
a man so scholastic that he cannot
tell an off-tackle slant from a drop-
kick or a fumble from an end-run;
and while it is true, though sad, that
there are co-eds—let us hope that
they are Lower Juniors—who are not
wise in the ways of the pigskin, these
persons, being so exceedingly dumb,
are, perforce, fair enough to obtain
escorts old enough to know better,
who will derive, strangely enough, a
thrill from expounding—to the co-
ed I have been talking about—the
writings of the late Mr. Camp. Nor
is Chicago uniquely learned in this
respect; it is certain that football is
generally understood in Urbana.

And the alumni, you tell me, are not
altogether ignorant in these matters.
Certain of them, to be sure, cannot
understand why the old methods—
the center rush and the flying wedge
—should have been abandoned; and
j certain others cannot see the wisdom
of hitting the line when a forward
! pass would gain fifty yards, maybe.

(Professor Comparative Literature)
Certain recent critics are appar-
ently alarmed at what they term
the preoccupation of contemporary
fiction with sex psychology. They

Yet, on the whole, the alumni display
a comprehension of the intricacies of
football which is commendable in per-
sons so nearly senile.

And now, you say, I have very
neatly demonstrated that the com-
mercialization you—by which you
mean me—have been deploring is no
commercialization at all, but a fool-
ish waste of supposedly good money.

But, say I, you forget the public.
And, the public be—jammed into our
stadium, is the motto of the Univer-
sity of Illinois. The public, of course,
knows less about football than does
a professor of Sanskrit Culture, but
the U. of I., being a paternalistic in-
stitution, takes care of such difficul-
ties; the public may sit at its ease,
unless the man in front elects to stand
up, nice and dry, if it remembered to
bring a tent, and from some distorted
cornucopia nearby a voice will issue,
proclaiming, “There goes Ted Strange
on one of his long runs—no, that was
wrong, he fell for a loss of eleven
yards,” or maybe “Kitten just missed
a hard field goal from the two yard
line; Illinois now leads 9-9.” All this
will the fatherly U. of I. do for the
public, for the purely nominal pay-
ment of three dollars per person.

In order to force congress to ratify
the treaty the Americans seized the
customs houses and shut off the pay-
ment of funds to the Haitian officials.
In October, the payment of current
salaries was resumed but on the or-
der of Secretary Daniels the question
of back salaries was held open until
after the treaty should be ratified.
Despite this financial pressure the
senate was still reluctant to ratify
the treaty and on November 10, Sec-
retary Daniels cabled Admiral Cap-
erton to call a meeting of the presi-
dent and his cabinet and to inform
them that if the Haitians did not
ratify the treaty, the United States

wolld assume complete control of the
island and would proceed to the paci-
fication of the inhabitants. This
threat of force was sufficient to in-
duce the Haitian Senate to ratify the
treaty on the following day. They
added, however, twenty-three reserva-
tions interpreting the meaning of the
various clauses. These reservations,
however, have never been accepted by
the United States. The American
Senate ratified the treaty in the first
part of 1916 and it went into effect
in May of that year.

The original treaty was to extend
for ten years, and included a provi-
sion that it might be renewed for a

seem to regard the prominence given
to relations between the sexes in
present day literature as the reflec-
tion of a social tendency which, they
solemnly warn us, threatens the very
sanctuary of our national virtue.
They talk as though all this were
something quite new and sinister.

To the historian of literature and
manners the alarm of these gentle-
men causes little but amusement.
The modern emphasis on love be-
tween the sexes is neither sinister
nor new.

The subject is one which has inter-
ested men and women ever since so-
ciety first became self-conscious, and
in at least one great period it domin-
ated narrative and lyric writings as
completely as it permeates the poetry
and fiction of our own day. Moreover,
the period was one which far from
being pernicious in its influence has
contributed vastly to the finest ideal-
ism of the modern world. During the
latter part of the twelfth century two
great forces which had for several
centuries been gathering impetus
reached their height. They were
Chivalry, with its emphasis upon
courtesy and nightly conduct, and
Courtly Love, with its fantastic code
of sex relationships. Both were re-
flected in a host of lyric and allegor-
ical poems and in a vast mass of ro-
mantic narratives known as romans
courtois, the earliest medieval prede-
cessors of the modern psychological
novel. According to the Courtly code,
ideal love can exist only between a
married woman and her lover; and
the romances, as well as the Celtic
1 tales from which they derive certain
elements, are full of stories in which
the reader’s sympathy is elicited for
the lover and the lady, while the hus-
band receives scant consideration.
Chretien de Troyes, the greatest
writer of courtly romances, devotes
long passages to discussions of the
emotion of the lover or of the lady.
No other medieval writer has ever
analyzed the sensations and emotions
created by sex appeal in greater de-
tail.

Courtly Love was a fad. The mor-
alists of the day fulminated against
it as the present-day critics fulminate
against the newer sex psychology. Its
ridiculous refinements and its some-
what sickly sentimentalism gradually
gave place to a more normal view of
sex matters. Consequently the at-
tentive student of contemporary so-
ciety has little fear that either so-
ciety or literature is going to the
demnition bow-wows because of a
temporary preoccupation with one of
the fundamental facts of human in-
tercourse.

I______________________________________

further term of ten years at the re-
quest of either party. In March, 1917,
the Haitian secretary of Foreign Af-
fairs, Louis Borno, signed an agree-
ment with the American minister to
Haiti extending the treaty for a fur-
ther term of ten years. This treaty
! was not ratified by the Haitian con-
gress. Many of the Haitians now
claim that the consent of the Haitian
congress was just as necessary for
the extension of the treaty as it was
for the original ratification of the
treaty and that Haiti cannot be said
to have asked for an extension of the
agreement. Many of the Haitians
believe that the treaty really expires
in May of this year.

In the spring of 1916, many mem-
bers of the Haitian congress tried to
impeach President Dartiguenave on
the grounds that he was subservient
to the American government. The
president then requested the Amer-
ican chief of the Haitian gendarmerie
to disolve congress and this was done.
Later meetings of the congress were
also broken up. A new congress was
elected in January, 1917, under the
supervision of the American officers
of the gendarmerie. When this con-
gress convened, it was presented with
a new constitution of Haiti which had
been written by the then assistant
secretary of the navy, Franklin D.
Roosevelt. It will be remembered that
Mr. Roosevelt declared in 1920, when
he was a vice presidential candidate,
that he ought to know something
about the constituion of the Republic
of Haiti since he had written it. This
new constitution granted to foreigners

Deserve Honors

This battle marked the close of
the doubles division of this season’s
remarkable I-M tennis season—re-
markable in the huge list of entries,
in the brand of tennis played, and
in the resulting close games and long
struggle to reach the final rounds.
The champions received a huge lov-
ing cup and handsome medalletes at
the close of the match yesterday, and
they had no doubt but what they
well deserved them—they knew that
they had earned them. They defeated
Sigma Nu the day before in th semi-
final, bracket by a 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 count.
The runners-up won their semi-final
match from an independent combin-
ation, Junker and DeBois. 1-6, 10-8,
6-3, after a spectacular comeback
won this important game, one of the
most greulling battles of the ntire
tourney. The more decisive wins of
the Betas in not only the closing
brackets, but throughout the whole
event, indicates that they were the
right team to win. In a play-off for
third place, the Sigma Nus, repre-
sented by Widmann and Clark, cop-
ped from Junker-DeBois by 6-3, 6-4,
6-3.

Madison, June 9.—Badger track
athletes will now bend their efforts
for the coming National Collegiate
track and field meet that is to be held
at the Soldiers Field in Chicago on
Saturday June 12.

Coach Jones has a half dozen per-
formers who warrant their entrance
in this great gathering of collegiate
sgtars, not only of stars, but of great
track teams that come from every
corner of the United States. The
Badgers, by finishing fifth in the
mighty meet of the Big Ten last week-
end showed sparkling performances of
several stars. These same men should
show their wares at the biggest gath-
ering of stairs and find places well
leaders.

Captain Kennedy has showed only
too well for some of the runners of
his distance, that he is one of the
greatest quarter-milers in the coun-
try. Jones has his captain entered in
this pet event and he is unanimously
picked as a possible winner. In the
high jump, the high hurdles and pole
vault, McGinnis will be the Badger

who will pick places in each,
versatile youngster has. shown
mettle and is sure to do his
against such a great field.

U. OF W. TO HAVE
BIG I-M FIELD

Madison, Wis.—The addition of
a plot of land ten acres in size bor-
dering on the land of the new dor-
mitories, will give to the University
of Wisconsin one of the finest in-
tramural Athletic fields in the coun-
try. The land will be fixed over into
baseball diamonds for the spring part
of the program and will serve a
greater purpose for football in the
fall. The extension of such a pro-
gram in the neighborhood of Camp
Randall will tend to center the entire
Badger athletic program away from
the lower campus. With the dorm-
itories on the verge of completion, it
means the growth of a new center for
Cardinal athletics, and an extension
that should carry them out of the
business district of the city. Another
factor that will make this the real
center of Wisconsin warriors is the
fast growing impetus for the field
house and the sanction of the regents
to a location just across the street
from the new intramural field.

FOR TOURNAMENT

Maroons Have Edge For
Team Honors in
Meet

Chicago’s undefeated golf team
plays at Lake Forest today, mainly
to try out and get used to the Knoll-
wood Country Club Course, where
the Conference Championship Tour-
nament is to be held tomorrow and
Saturday.

Maroons Favored

Kenny Hisert, Dorsey, Bartlett,
and Patterson, the Maroon foursome,
should be the favorites for team
honors, having registered dual meet
victories over all the schools repre-
sented except Northwestern.

They should also have a good
chance for the individual champion-
ship, Captain Hisert having copped
that event last season.

Purdue, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio,
and Northwestern are the other con-
testants. Northwestern, winner of
the team championship last year,
and Michigan are the other outstand-
ing outfits. According to Hisert,
“Northwestern is favored by many
to win again this year, but I do not
think that they will repeat. There
are four reasons—Dorsey, Bartlett,
Patterson, and myself. We are out
to win, and if we are up to the form
that has characterized our play this
season I believe we will clean up.”

The tournament is to be conducted
on the same plan as in previous years
—seventy-two holes of medal play.

Following the request of presi-
dents of western conference uni-
versities that migration of students
to athletic contest, football games
in particular, be curtailed, the Big
Ten athletic directors have voted
to do everything possible to com-
ply with the suggestion.

One of the first steps in this di-
rection has been taken and no
tickets will be sent to another in-
stitution whose team and rooters
have to travel a great distance and
miss classes on Fridays and Mon-
days. The presidents, however,
held out no objection to students
making the trips which can be cov-
erd in one day. This would in-
clude the games between Chicago,
and Northwestern, Illinois and
Chicago, and Purdue and Indiana.

Scientific

Hitter

McConnell, a member of the Alpha
Sigma Phi fraternity, has been a
strong factor in both the attack and
defense of Norgren’s nine this year.
He is one of the three leading hitters,
and his fielding bobbles have been un-
usually few. Although McConnell is
not noted for the distance of his hits
he manages to place them scientific-
ally, and it is by this means that he
has mounted up his large batting
average. His ability to come through
in a pinch prompted Norgren to give
him the favored third position in the
batting lineup.

John Ludlam, of Knoxville, Pa.,
pitching his first year for Coach Carl
Lundgren, is the leading Illini hurler
for 1926.

iLudlam won four and lost one con-
ference game; while he won eight
and lost but one during the entire
season. Johnny, a senior in Educa-
tion, went there last year from Penn
State college. As a freshman he
played at second base, and was one of
the best freshman hurlers. This
spring Ludlam started out with two
of the six Illinois victories on the
Southern training trip; then won four
straight games in the conference, only
to lose his last one to Michigan when
he forced across the winning tally in
the ninth with the bases full.

His other two victories came

non-conference games, j

He won

in

through with his eighth win against
Mississippi A. & M. when he singled

Star Gopher Men
Coming to N C A

Captain Bill Gruenhagen, Fred
Just, and probably two other mem-
bers of the Minnesota track team,
will enter the national intercollegiate
track meet at Chicago June 26, ac-
cording to a statement made by Coach
Sherman Finger of the Gophers.

Both men placed in two events in
the conference meet at Iowa last Sat-
urday, and on the strength of their
performances in the Big Ten compe-
tition it has been decided to take them
to the national meet.

Most of MacGillivray’s varsity
swimmers have connected with life
guard jobs for this summer in order
to keep in trim for next fall. As a
result the men will be able to imme-
diately swing into action next year.

Captain Ed. Noyes will face his
second term of leadership with the
mermen and with the experience
gained in former duals will be one of
the bulwarks of next year’s Var-
sity, The yearling Captain, Cornie
Oker is expected to cop inumerable
honors in the dashes, relays and back
stroke evnts. Lavezorrio, Hough,
Harris, will be new additions to the
relay and crawl events and with the
veterans, Greenberg, Rittenhouse and
Noyes, a fast relay team is expect-
ed. Last year’s relay combination
tied the conference record and Mac
is looking forward to shattering it
with the group of swimmers.

The crew will have the backing
of Eddy Fellinger and Tudor Wil-
der for the dives, two veterans who
just failed to place in the confer-
ence. In the breaststroke event,
Mygdal will lead the field. Florez, who
was ineligible last season is expected
to put up a good fight for a berth
in this event against Baumrucher,
another veteran, Grandell, a fresh-
man star, Stevenson and Getsov of
numeral fame.

MacGillivray is glad to have Bob
Markley back again at the breast-
stroke, who was ruled ineligible this
season. The tank, is to be kept
open all summer, so the men may
have an opportunity to benefit from
vacation practice.

Comes From Arkansas

McConnell was among those who
made the Japan tour last spring. He
began his career on the diamond with
the Hot Springs, Ark., high school
nine where after he had played on
most of the infield posts he was finally
placed at short.

His long experience has given him
the faculty of sizing up a situation
in a moment, and his playing in the
important shortstop job with Brignall

at third
field the
ness.

should give next year’s in-
necessary amount of steadi-

Prospects Bright

Next year’s nine will be practically
the same which took the field this
spring, and McConnell will, in all
probability, be conducting a winner.
Although Gubbins will leave, Marks
will be available for mound duty.
Marks, who was ineligible during the
latter part of this season, has plenty
of stuff if he could control it. Zim-
merman, who did not pitch effectively
in the few innings in which he was
given an opportilnity to, will also re-
turn for duty. Kaplan, a freshman
southpaw’ chucker, should help Nor-
gren in his need for good hurling.

The infield which played this sea-
son will perform again next spring.

Brignall, one of the
ence hitters, will be
McConnell at short,
on second, and Price

leading confer-
at third, with
Kyle Anderson
or Macklind on

first. Webster wil be behind the plate
to continue the good work which he
accomplished for this year’s team.

ARTICLE TELLS OF FIRST YEAR
OF STAGG’S ATHLETIC REGIME

Another laurel is added to Coach
A. A. Stagg’s long list of honors in an
article appearing in this week’s Big
Ten Weekly. The story is called,
“When Stagg Played Halfback” and
gives a beautifully condensed history
of the birth of football at the young
University of Chicago. The steadfast
character of Chicago’s Old Man, then
a young man with unbeatable athletic
ability, is very ably portrayed
throughout the article.

It tells how Stagg was called to
Chicago to be its first athletic and
physical director. At Yale he had
been one of her greatest baseball
pitchers and in his senior year had

been placed on Walter Camp’s All-
American team—although he had only
a year’s experience. Then at the call
to the new University he brought all
of his football determination with
him and succeeded by interviewing
each male student in getting together

fourteen men who had the
foothall stuff.

That first year he played
on his own team, with the

inherent

halfback
full ap-

proval of all his opponents and with
the team he had built up, succeeded
in winning eight of the games on the
schedule of thirteen. And all of this
in the face of the handicap of having
no athletic field nor any athletic
equipment to start with.

When it9s a rainy
night—and with three crafty
bridge players your luck
is running wild
—have a Camel!

Camels represent the utmost in cigarette quality. The
choicest of Turkish and Domestic tobaccos are blended into
Camels by master blenders and the finest of French cigarette
paper is made especially for them. Into this one brand is
concentrated all of the knowledge, all of the skill of the
world’s largest organization of expert tobacco men.

WHEN the dark skies art
pouring rain outside.
And fickle fate deals you
hands at bridge that you
play with consummate
skill—have a Camel!

For Camel is the silent
partner that helps every
deserving player win his
game. Camels never hurt
or tire the taste, never
leave a trace of cigaretty
after-taste. Regardless of
the gold you spend,
you’ll never get choicer
tobaccos than those
rolled into Camels.

So this evening as you
ply your unerring skill,
evoke then the mellow,
est fragrance that ever
came from a cigarette.

Have a Camel!

Our highest wish, if you
do not yet know Camel
quality, is that you try
them. We invite you to
compare Camels with
any cigarette made at
any price.

AMERICA GOVERNS
HAITIAN REPUBLIC

(Caatinued from page 2)

the right to hold land. This had been
prevented in Haiti since 1804 when
the blacks had finally succeeded in
driving the French out from the
country and in winning their economic
and political independence. The
Haitians had always been afraid that
if the whites were permitted once
more to own land they would soon
reduce the natives again to economic
subjection.

The Haitian congress refused to
ratify this constitution but it was in
turn dissolved by Major Smedley D.
Butler who was then the American
commander of the Haitian gendar-
merie. The immediate order to dis-
solve the congress came from Presi-
dent Dartiguenave but the real order
came from the commander of the
American forces.

The American occupation was then
faced with an interesting problem.
What political body could ratify the
constiution? The Americans then
turned to the plebescite as a means
of getting the constitution ratified.
Copies of the constitution were print-
ed and distributed through the island,
but it is distinctly problematical how
much the Haitians knew of its con-
tents since at least 85 per cent of
them ar illiterate. The election,
nevertheless, was held in the spring
of 1918 and the polling places were
in charge of gendarmes, supervised
by American officers. Two sets of
ballots were prepared; the first con-
sisted of slips of white paper which
signified approval; the second con-
sisted of slips of blue paper which
signified disapproval. The voters en-
tering the polling places were handed
white slips. If they wished to vote

“no,” they could ask the
charge for blue slips. As
expected, very few asked
slips and the constitution

officer in
would be

dared to have been ratified by a vote
of 98,000 to 769. The testimony that
we took in Haiti on this point seems
to indicate clearly that the Haitians
were not given a fair opportunity to
vote on the constitution.

The constitution provides for a con-
gress of two houses, the members of
which are to be elected by the people
and who are to choose the president
in joint assembly. It is provided that
the elections for this congress are to
be held in January of the even years,
and that the President of the Re-
public shall designate the year. This
has been interpreted to mean that the
president is not compelled to designate
the year and neither of the Haitian
presidents has as yet done so. No
congress has been held, therefore,
since that which was dissolved in
1917. Who, then, constitutes the
Haitian government aside from the
president and how is the president
chosen? The legislative powers are
given to a Council of State which con-
sists of twenty-one members appoint-
ed by the President and who hold of-
fice only at the pleasure of the Presi-
dent. This council in turn elects the
President! It will be seen from this,

Dispose of your USED TEXT
therefore, that the government of
Haiti is at least a self-perpetuating
oligarchy.

We offer this feature collection of magnificent beaded
bags at prices which, we believe, are the lowest ever
asked in Chicago for bags of this character. It will be
a pleasure to carry one—so marvelous are the color-
ings and designs of these new bags. The beads are so
fine and the bags so soft and well made that they are
equal to bags usually sold for twice the price.
