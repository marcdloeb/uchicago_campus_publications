Lauds Prohibition as Uphold-

Standards

have any bearing on the prohibition
question. It is a living problem, be-
longing to the present alone.”

Thus Shailer Mathews, Dean of the
Divinity school, summed up the ques-
tion of justifying license, discounting
scriptural consideration that has over-
run the country ever since the Church
Temperance society of the Protestant
Episcopal church declared itself “over-
whelmingly in favor of a modification
of the Volstead Act.”

Bible No Moral Code

“Polygamy, slavery and carnage in
war have been justified by the Bible,
continued Dean Mathews, “but civili-
zation has advanced beyond these, as
it has advanced beyond the daj s of
the saloon and all its inconceivable
horrors.”

Flaying The edict of William < ardi-
,,a| O’Connell, ranking prelate of the
Roman Catholic church, who declared
that “compulsory prohibition is flatly ।
opposed to Holy Scripture.” the schol-
ar exclaimed that "any man who uses
the Bible to justify the abolition o
the eighteenth amendment does not
know how to read the Bible.”

For the first time since the day of

tofore all reports concerning Dean
Wilkins’ condition have been issued
by Drs. James and Kretschmer, who
were constantly in attendance to him,
but yesterday a Daily Maroon re-
porter was accorded the privilege of
hearing welcome news from the Dean
himself.

“I shall leave the hospital Friday
to go home,” he said briefly, “that is
all, I guess, for the present.” This
conversation confirms the report re-

Keeney, who is a representative of
Federation, has been active on the
Board for two years.

A discussion around the fire place
in the Y. W. C. A. room of Ida Noyes

the different groups comprising the
Board were discussed. According to

SHOW DISEASES IN
MICE AS HEREDITARY
IN MICROPHONE TALK

Relating in detail the methods by
which she conducted tests on 50,000
mice and arrived at the conclusion
that the tendency to contract cancer
is hereditary, Miss Maud Slye of the
University biological laboratories
gave the radio audience an insight
into scientific procedure in a talk last
night from The Daily News station,
WMAQ.

Explaining the Mendelian theory of
heredity, which is generally accepted
by scientists, Miss Slye told how she
first bred mice to develop pure
strains. Some of the mice produced
were resistent to cancer, while others
were susceptible.

By crossing mice of these two
types, the investigator was able to
determine how the tendency to can-
cer was inherited. Her results, she
asserted, show that the trait may lie
dormant in an individual for a gen-
eration and still appear in his child-
ren.

Another important result of her
work is a practical elimination of the
germ theory for the origin of cancer.

Erroneous conceptions about the fin-

mostly to reporters’ passion for mak-

Various types of positions may be

WINTER NUMBER OF

CAMPUS TOMORROW

Poetry of Edward Sapir, associate
professor in the department of an-
thropology, will be included in the is-
sue of the Forge, the University jour-
nal of verse, which will appear to-
morrow. “Since the amalgamation
of the Circle and Phoenix,” said
George Dillon, president of the Poetry
club, under whose auspices the maga-
zine is published, “the Forge is the
only literary publication on campus.

and as such deserves the
everyone.”

Women desiring to sell

Like father, like son.

Once again the old adage rings
true, this time in the halls of Kent
Chemical laboratory where Prof. Wil-
liam Draper Harkins and his 20-year
old son, Harry, have undertaken an
experiment that may give to the
world a cure for nephritis, besides
throwing light upon cancer — the
mystery disease of humankind.

With the hope of determining the
surface tension of human blood taken
from diseased bodies, Dr. Harkins,
adviser to the Department of Chem-
istry has begun experimentation that
will run into months, if not years.
Hany, who is a graduate student,
has charge of most of the laboratory
work, while his father is directing the
technical and theoretical procedure.

“Our work along this line is not
the first of its kind,” declared the
elder Harkins, “but it has never been
dealt with exclusively enough to
benefit mankind.

“Definite results of our calcula-
tions will merely give us an addi-
tional problem: to find a quantity
that if injected into the patient’s
bodv will raise or lower the surface
tension, as the case may demand, to

reach normalcy.”

Standards of living in the United

China, and who has traveled extensive-

head marshall of the University, will
act in his official capacity; and the
college marshalls and aides will assist
generally.

The reception will mark a great
event in the history of the University.
Few such affairs hav^ ever been ar-
ranged. Its purpose is to acquain' the
host of students with the present ad-
ministration, in answer to a suggestion
voiced last quarter by Pres. Mason.

Expect Large Gathering

“We expect every student that-can
possibly make arrangements to have
tonight free, to come out for the re-
ception.” said Miss Graham yester
day. “As a matter of courtesy to the
new administration, at least one-half
of the undergraduate body should be
present. There are too few events
in the school calendar to allow the
students to come into persona! contact
with the higher officials of the Uni-

there, and already the competition

Industry in China at present is not

laws are made and executed by small
groups of foreigners seeking persona!
gain, and endangering high standards
in the United States and other nations.

DIPLOMAS: ^ BIT OF HISTORY

ONE account, published Wednesday of a pro-
posal to stop the giving of actual diplomas
at convocation, has moved an officer of the Uni-
versity to comment thus on the proposal:

To the editor:

I am somewhat perplexed and also amused at the
editorial of Feb. 3 “How Will You Have Your Sheep
Skin?” I am at a loss to know why the question of
technique concerning this matter should have arisen.
What would be the “greater convenience” if the Presi-
dent handed a dummy to each candidate “to be ex-
changed for a diploma later”? It certainly would not be
as convenient for the Recorder’s Office and I cannot see
how it would be as convenient for the candidates. As to
whether or not there should be any diploma at all, that
is another question.

There is a bit of history connected with this subject
which may be of interest. The President is not follow-
ing a “tradition” in giving to each candidate his own
diploma. He is following a carefully worked out prac-
tice. This practice like many other improvements in
educational methods is due to William Rainey Harper,
the first President of the University. Many years ago
he said to the writer, “We ought to arrange some way
to give each candidate his own diploma so that there
would be no need of exchanging after the degrees are
conferred. Work out a plan.” The result was that
after a few experiments the present plan was evolved
and has been in successful operation ever since. The
diplomas are arranged in alphabetical order for each
group and are put in cloth rolls provided with loops so
that each diploma can be pulled out promptly as the
candidate approaches the President’s chair. Correspond-
ing lists have been handed to the Head Marshal, who dis-
tributes them among his assistants, in order that the
candidates may be lined up in such a way that when
they take their seats and from there ascend the plat-
form they will come in the same order in which the
diplomas are already arranged. Just after the last roll
call the Head Marshal sends a report to me on the stage
and if there are any absentees their diplomas are passed
by in the distributing. Again and again we have had
compliments from visitors from other institutions on
the smoothness of the whole proceeding and interested
inquiries as to how we do it. Repeatedly has it occurred
that in some of our largest convocations things have
gone through without a single slip of any kind. This is
due to the thoughtfulness of President Harper, for whom
no item was too small to be overlooked and no great de-
velopment too vast to be beyond his prophetic vision.

Yours sincerely,

F. J. Gurney,
Assistant Recorder.

should not be a feeling of being driven through
the last three quarters.

It is not too soon for the freshman to think of
his sequences. Let him decide what he wants to
specialize in; and begin taking the course now.
Thus he will avoid the oppression so often felt
by the senior. Certain courses are not offered
every quarter, or even every year, and in order
to make these available, the student should have
his work definitely planned out. If his sequence
is drudgery, he can finish that drudgery early,
and have some time free for electives. Do it now.

SOCIAL SPHERE

'T'HERE perhaps has not been an equal to the
■*■ excitement pervading the campus today, the
day of the President’s reception. One thousand
undergraduates are planning to attend the func-
tion, which has long been spoken of as one of
the few social presentations of the season.

This reception, held for President and Mrs.
Max Mason, will occur this evening at seven-thirty
in Mandel Hall and Hutchinson Commons. It is
to be formally opened by an address delivered by
the President and one delivered by the Vice-
President, Mr. Woodward, in Mandel Hall. After
this opening the guests will go to Hutchinson
Commons where they will be received by the
President and Mrs. Mason, Vice-President and
Mrs. Woodward, Mr. and Mrs. Robert V. Mer-
rill, and Charles Anderson, president of the Un-
dergraduate council.

This reception marks so significant a factor in
our sphere because of the very nature of its pur-
pose, to introduce the undergraduate students to
the President and the newly appointed Vice-
President; its significance is also marked by the
fact that it is an original affair, this marking the
first reception of its kind for the University.

Preceding this reception on Wednesday the
girl's dormitories have planned to present as is
the custom in every Winter Quarter an Inter-Hall
Vaudeville in Ida Noyes theatre at three-thirty.
Each Dormitory presents a stunt, skit, or play as
their fancy chooses. Kathleen Brimrose is man-
aging the production for this year.

DO IT NOW

NOW that registration is approaching, the time

is ripe to think of sequences. These are sup-
posed to be made out by the end of the sopho-
more year, but too often they are neglected. As
a consequence, a senior is frequently taking three
courses for his major at the last moment, or is
feverishly trying to complete a necessary unit by
correspondence.

The Senior year should be one of additional
achievement beyond the requirement of a major
or minor, or it should offer an opportunity for
much-desired electives. But, above all, it should ,
not be crowded with necessary courses; there (

VOX POP

The Daily Maroon,
Dear Sirs:

Who is responsible for the vile publicity ac-'
corded the triple-A students of last quarter? He
has been guilty of laying bare confidential mat-
ters. Were those people listed, consulted, and
asked beforehand if they wanted their grades be-
trayed all over the campus? They were not. Do
you publish the list of F or E students? It is not
less of a stigma to be known as an A student than
an E student.

Moreover, every one knows that grades are not
uniform: one instructor’s A is another’s B; that
for work one loves one may get an A; that one
doesn’t necessarily get an A every quarter. In
fact, in this last connection it is not too much to
assume that many, though they are now classed
as A students may never before have received
three A s, though they may have done the same
caliber of work.

Was this publicity intended to impress some-
one? The students themselves? What folly to
awaken in them a bloated spirit of intellectual
superiority when perhaps they are of only average
intelligence (it’s possible) I

If you don’t do another thing, gentlemen of the
Maroon, please give this to him who has betrayed
confidential records.

Irately yours,

A. A. A. (of last quarter).

CHANCES OF WIN
FROM WISCONSIN

Which Reveals That Spradling,

High Scorer, Lives in Frankfort

McDonough, Hoerger and
Farwell Out of Cage

Team Lineup

Injuries are playing a potent part
in reducing the already depleted
ranks of the Maroon eagers. With
McDonough still ailing with a twisted
ankle and Hoerger not yet fully re-
covered from a slight illness, the
Maroon defense suffers considerably.
Now Lalon Farwell, the former Hyde
Park star and reserve guard, is con-
valescing from a few’ stitches in his
jaw which were necessary as a result
of colliding with Wallie Marks’ elbow
during scrimmage last Monday night.

Need Subs

That the Maroons are in need of
capable reserves should any of the
Maroons be eliminated via the foul
route is obvious. Last Saturday
night, against the Buckeyes, with
Alyea out of the fray after four
fouls, the team was in an embarras-
sing dilemna For this reason Nor-
gren is devoting much energy toward
polishing off the playing of the sec-
ond team. Games with the Badgers
are always bitterly contested and
fouls may early eliminate the best
players of both teams so that the
burden will fall on the backs of the
reserves.

Meanwell’s eagers come here after
a layoff of nearly three weeks, and
according to all reports from Madi-
son, they have reached peak form.
Behr, one of the highest scorers of
the Big Ten is a “bear” on the floor
as well as in shooting. His diminu-
tive teammate Andrews is a streak
of greased lightning and a tiger roll-
ed into one.

Sophs Good

The sophomores of Meanwell’s crew
are so good that even Capt. Brooks
is a sub. Hotchkiss plays forward or
center. The guards Powell, Merkle,
and Barnum are three husky guards
that may or may not make the shoot-
ing of the Maroons any poorer. On
the whole, it looks like a tough week-
end for the Norgrenites. But then
since the locals beat them decisively
on their own floor, they should logic-
ally win with the advantage of the
home floor. But, unfortunately bas-
ketball isn’t logical, as has been re-
peatedly demonstrated throughout
the present season.

Take Pictures of
I-M Cup Winners

Today at 1:00 p. m. sharp, pic-
tures of the various Intra-Mural
champions are to be taken. The
men are to be in front of Bartlett
Gymnasium at that hour. Here is
the list of the champions.

Shapinsky: Tennis singles cham- |
pion.

Golf winners: University and
Freshman.

A. T. O.: Wrestling winners
last Spring.

Delta Sigma Phi: Spring Ath-
letic Carnival winners.

Macs: Horseshoe winners.

Oker and Krogh of Kappa Sig- i
ma and Johnson of Phi Kappa
Sigma high point men in the
swimming events for last fall are
asked to be present.

The Intra-Mural managers are '
also to have their pictures taken

My attention has been called (this
is the proper form) to a malicious at-
tack made on me in yesterday’s
Whistle. It is not my custom to read
the Whistle—indeed, it is not the
custom of many other people, either
—so had not this public-spirited ac-
quaintance, who does not even shud-
der to read the Whistle, brought the
matter to my notice it would have
entirely escaped me. Even so, I
should not now be deigning to make
answer to that attack were it not so
entirely vitriolic. As it is, I con-
sider it my duty, bending meanwhile
a gaze of gentle reproach upon Ter-
rible Turk, to respond-.

I had. in the first place, considered
my argument with Turk over the
chapel rushing argument as definitely
settled. I had thought Turk ignom-
iniously unhorsed in his career with
me in the lists, to be lying, in fact,
in the dust, thoroughly humbled and
cognizant of the error of his ways.
I had, accordingly, turned my back
on him, and walked off to busy my-
self with more interesting and more
worthwhile matters. But, reading!
what Turk has to say in yesterday’<!
Whistle, I see that immediately upon |
my turning away from him he sprang

INTRA-MURAL CAGE

TOURNEY DRAWS TO
SUCCESSFUL CLOSE

r

Alter last night's play in the intra-
mural basketball tournament and the
four “A” league tilts tomorrow night,
the champions in each league will be
pretty well decided, The finals, which
will bring fort the all-university cham-
pions of 1926, will probably start
sometime within the next week or so.

This season was probably one of the
most successful basket years which
the intra-mural department has pulled
off since the beginning of its existence.
The finals will close the season for
the second major sport of the year
and will be played off as the feature
of the Winter Athletic Revue, to be
held soon.

The Macs, who won the non-Greek
title, will contend with the other
leaders for the honor of the champion-
ship of the University.

The above official and up-to-the
second compilation indicates the lead-
ing individual point scorers of the
present somewhat-contested Big Ten
basketball scramble, and also serves,
very appropriately, to introduce the
subject of this article, Mr. George C.
Spradling.

To those who occupied the none-too-
steady and altogether-too-scarce
bleachers in Bartlett gymnasium on
the night of January the 20th he
needs no introduction, for all that
they have to do is recall the Purdue
team that played the second half—
he was it! Along with pulling down
Norgren’s floating hopes he also col-
lected 16 of the 59 points credited to
him above. His method of collection
was to shove his nose about a six-
teenth of an inch above the floor and
then dribble the ball along a snake’s
course past, around or through Mc-
Donough or Hoerger or anyone that
happened to be in his near vicinity
until he came to a position under the
basket from where he would shoot.
At this point the official scorer would
mark down a basket opposite his
name without even waiting for the
result of the heave.

Captain George was born in Frank-
fort, Indiana, played basketball on
the Frankfort, Indiana, high school
team and when vacation time rolls
around, as it does once in a while, he
leaves LaFayette for Frankfort, In-
diana. Yes, his father and his moth-
er think he’s just a great big boy.

Washington Park Rink Is
Scene of Prelims
Today

At last Old Man Weather has come
across with the necessary ice to stage
the longed for but pro-longed Intra-
mural Ice carnival. This big affair
has been postponed several times but
has only grown in interest with each
postponement. Over 140 entries have
been received by the Intramural De-
partlment and everything has ]>een
put in readiness to make the first
meet of its kind a highly successful
one for both the participants and the
1-M management.

That is, everything but the ice was
provided for and that was left to take

care of itself. Now, if the thermom-

eter doesn’t take a sudden jump up-
wards, Fritz Crisler is going to start
the carnival at 3:30 this afternoon
when he lines up the men contestants

for the preliminary events. A 220 yd.
track has been cleared off and slicked

up at the Washington Park lagoon.
All men entered in the 220, 440, 880,
and one-mile events are requested to
report at the southeast end of the
Washington Park bathhouse by 3:00
o’clock this afternoon. Preliminaries
in these events will be held to decide

up from his horizontal posture and
stealthily followed me, his dirk up-
raised to strike me unawares.

That dagger blow fell upon my de-
fenseless back yesterday. I find Turk
heaping upon me the most vile terms
of abuse and opprobrium; I find him
resorting to the most underhanded
and shady insinuations. I am
aroused; I defend myself. I point
out to Turk that no gentleman would
ever descend to mere vulgar and
tawdry personalities. I point out to
him that I had had faith that he was
a gentleman. And I am grieved to
tell him that that faith has been dis-
appointed.

Due to the small number of women
entries, it will not be necessary to run
preliminaries for them, but the 220
and 440 yard events to be held Thurs-
day will be none the less interesting.
Probably the most thrilling of all will
be the men's relay, with eleven teams
competing for honors. This is to be
held on the final day, as is the fancy
skating event, which will also be very
popular with the spectators.

All of the customary awards are to
be presented to the winning individ-
uals and organizations.

Kreuger Elected
Wrestling Captain

David Kreuger, former Lind-
blom wrestler in the 117-pound
class, was elected captain of the
freshman grapplers last Saturday
afternoon in a meeting of the
squad.

The freshman team is coming
along very well, according to
Coach Vorres and is pretty well
represented in all weights. In a
few of the classes, though, there
are no outstanding men.

“Young” Proudfoot is a fine
heavyweight wrestler who is also
a numeral man on the frosh foot-
ball outfit. Green, who wrestles
at 125 pounds, is also a strong
man for the grapplers. He is a I
product of Springfield, Illinois.

Krueger himself is the best man
in his class and would be an asset*
to any wrestling squad. Coach
Vorres has been very much pleased t
with the work and personnel of •
the group.

scheduled to be run off in connection

DELTA SIGS WIN

FAST CONTESTS

Many Tilts Are Forfeited
But Large Crowd
Attends

By Jack Welty

Featured by several of the fastest
games of the season two league cham-
pionships were decided last night in
Bartlett gym. Many of the games
were postponed or forfeited due to
the inclement weather but the larg-
est crowd of the year turned out to
view the encounters.

In the best game on the program
Delta Sigma Phi defeated Delta Tau
Delta 17 to 12 for the championship
of the Sigma league. The encounter
wes replete with thrills and a great
number of fouls were committed by
both aggregations.

Healy Stars

Healy was the big man for the
Delts and besides playing a good floor
game contributed three baskets. Fer-
ris and Gaskill were the main cogs
in the Delta Sig attack.

The A. T. O.’s led by Kyle Ander-
son and Kassell, each of which sank
four markers continued their flag
quest by downing the Phi Sigma
Delta five by a score of 23 to 15.
Murphy’s guarding was also a fea-
ture of the winners while Preiss with
5 field goals bore the brunt of the
losers offense.

Dekes Win

The Dekes had an easy time with
the Sig Chi’s who were handicapped
by the loss of their two star scorers.

THE MIRACLE

A fiasco in three acts, four reels, and
a few scenes by the Director.

ACT I—The curtain rises disclosing
a jungle scene in Siberia. Wockle-
birds flit from limb to limb much
like the eyes of a man at the Follies.
The Female chorus of sixty, and
seventy-five, prance across the stage.
They are followed by six hundred
Spanish dancers, twenty-four Pilgrim
maids, thirteen thousand Greek ban-
ana growers, led by Fred Handschy
in a Charleston novelty. Teddy Linn,
disguished as a college professor,
strides in whereupon they break down
into song—

Oh, we are the heroes of our U. of C.

Hurray for the red, white and blue
In our Venice gondola we drink Coca

Cola,

To the king our full homage is due.
So on with the slaughter, I’ll marry
your daughter

And show them how Gascons can
die.

‘Sippi, I’m dippy to see you again

Hit the walk—Join a frat-Swat the
fly?

They are interrupted by two college
students in red underwear, feeding
each other from nursing bottles. Sud-
denly one turns upon the other. “You
stole my wife, you horse-thief.” The
other turns pale, and gasps. “Is that
right. Richard? Oh. voodoo’ll I do?” ‘
Blades are produced, a shot is heard j
in the distance, and two icemen car- j
ry them out . . cold.

ACT 11—In front of Cobb Hall. |
The spirits of Boccacio, Pater, the!
Four Marx Brothers, and Will Ghere!
crawl around the C bench chanting:!
Roses are blooming in Rosenwald.
Near die rye in our dear Ryerson—
Angels are harping in Harper yet.
And the work of the Cashier is dun.
The rain still is falling near Reynolds
That we ken from our work in Kent
lab—

And that loud speaking chap in our
Chapel

Is the bozo we’d all like to grab!

They turn and run out as they are ac-
costed by the Junior Class Council.
The College Student, costumed as a
Deke, sidles in; they advance upon
him. "Buy a Ticket to the Class Din-
ner, Feb. 11?”

C. Student—“Sure .sure. Can you
get me about twenty-five tickets?”

George W.—“I’ll have ’em for you
this afternoon, (exits over footlights)

Enter a Club girl, but intelligent.
She is addressed by the College Stu-
dent. but honest. “Hello. How are
you, and would you care to have lunch
with me? Wait and I will get me
some bucks.”

She—“How dare you speak to me
thus? I'm not t—k—o—a—g—! Sir,
call me a conveyance.”

C. S. (obligingly—Allright. You—
you ash care—YOU!”

Peace is finally restored, the maiden
is placated and promoted, he stops a
frat. bro. who is passing by. “Say, old
man, let me have ten dollars will
you?”

Frater—“Nope, you're credit is sunk
with me.”

C. S.—“Really, J’m good for it.
See this—(he calls to George W.)—
Hey. can you get me that twenty-five
this afternoon?”

Geo. W.—“Sure.”

C. S.—“Please give him ten—
Thanks. (To Bro.) Now do you see?"

He takes the money and dashes off
stage. He is heard cranking nis car.
when he is approached by Chuck An
derson. armed with a statement and
a collection plate—“Help the Drive?”

He sings blithely, as the girl skips
into the car beside him, "No. we can’t
contribute. We’re off on a Student
Friendship drive ourselves now!"
