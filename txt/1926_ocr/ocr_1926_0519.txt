PROF. KRUGER
TELLS TRIALS
OF CHRISTIANS

CHI PSI’S BOW TO
MIDNIGHT FOOTPAD

German Scholar Presents
New Discoveries in
Roman Times

“Christianity owes its triumph
primarily to the deeds of its adher-
ents” is the opinion of Prof. Gustav
Kruger of the University of Gies-
sen, Germany, who spoke before a
group of theology clubs at the Uni-
versity yesterday afternoon on “Re-
cent Studies in Early Christian
Martyrdom.”

Review* Document*

Dr. Kruger presented a scholarly
review of evidence to be found in
writings and documents on the pros-
ecutions of Christians under the
Roman empire, telling how, for a con-
siderable period, the laws authoriz-
ing their punishment were optional,
and not employed to a large extent,
until “the reign of Decius first
brought a radical change.”

Decius ordered all Christians to
make public sacrifice to the Roman
gods, and they received certificates
showing that they had complied, but
“some Christians purchased their lib-
erty by means of securing such a
certificate or ‘libellus’ in some man-
ner without actually sacrificing.”

A housebreaker,possessed of the
technique but not of the courage
that makes a jgood thief, success-
fully garnered Chi Psi jewelry val-
ued at five hundred dollars in a
robbery Monday night and then
left it on the back doorstep. He
had just completed a successful
robbery of the lodge and was de-
parting with his prize, when he
realized the fate that awaited him
should he be captured by his
Greek victims, and, terrified by
the thought, dropped the loot and
speedily left the vicinity of the
house at 5735 University Ave.

Ten jeweled fraternity badges
and six watches wete in the bun-
dle that the joyful Greeks discov-
ered wrapped in a towel in the
backyard yesterday morning in the
search that followed the discovery
of the robbery. Cash amounting
to $150 went away in the pockets
of the thief, however, and the rob-
bers report that not even a nickel
with which to call up tthe police
was left in the sacked house.

The police were notified Tues-
day morning, and according to
one of the more prominent senior
members, are expected Friday
morning.

PRIZE CONTEST
TRYOUTS HELD

East, West, North, South—from
every point of the compass the en-
tries for the World’s Greatest In-
terscholastic to be held on Soldier’s
Field on June 4 and 5 are pouring
in from the pick of the athletes in
all parts of the country. Eighty-one
entrants from sixteen high schools,
entering in over two hundred events
is the record to date, and every man
entered has made an exceptional rec-
ord in his specialty at recent meets.

East High Enters

The far-famed relay team of East
high school, Columbus, Ohio, is en-
tering the National meet, hoping to
add to its record of breaking two in-
terscholastic records in the half and
quarter mile relays. The high school
is quite wrought up about their team,
postponing a local meet in favor of
the University’s, and an anonymous
donor has contributed the funds nec-
essary for the four athletes to make
the journey.

Heads Meet Today

Today at noon, the heads of the

First steps in the preparation of
the Senior vodvil were taken yester-
day when ten prospective numbers

friars, and other campus productions.,
as well as several entirely new acts
and personnels.

are Janet Good and troupe; Rudolph

WOMEN TO OCCUPY

To fill the “horse shoe” of Mandel

Committee. The boxes will be re-
served for the first twelve women’s
organizations to register with Cath-
erine Fitzgerald, chairman of the
committee. Owing to the fact that
W. A. A., Federation, Y. W. C. A.,
Freshman Women’s club, and the
twelve social clubs have assured the
committee of the support of their
members, those wishing boxes have
been urged to sign early.

In an effort to acquaint every
woman on campus with the plans of
the committee, announcements will
be made in all the women’s halls in

SABBATH TENNIS

JENNIS is a real, live, wholesome and invigorating sport for red-
• blooded men and women. It is popular with hundreds of
University students, and when the weather permits the fine courts
provided for a nominal fee are busy—for six days a week. The
other day they are idle, though the weather be perfect.

The very students who are most in need of and most entitled
to the mental relaxation and physical stimulation offered by tennis
are deprived of that benefit by the six-day policy in the administra-
tion of courts. They are the men and women who are forced to
work in order to attend school and have little or no time for day-
time recreation except on Sundays. Often these people must sit
in stuffy offices perhaps in sight of their fellow students who are
wielding the rackets. On Sunday they have a few hours to them-
selves and the courts are idle. ,

True, there are public courts, but the townspeople crowd them
on Sunday and they are not numerous enough for all who would
play, aside from students.

Sunday tennis is in no wise a violation of any reasonable con-
ception of Sabbath Day observance. The sport is a wholesome
mental and moral influence as well as being physically healthful.
The cost of keeping the courts open on Sunday would be negligible.
There can be no valid objection in the minds of reasonable men
to the plan—yet the University’s tennis courts are idle every seventh
day.

COMPULSORY CHAPEL

COMPULSORY chapel does not necessarily make us good. That
point seems clear enough. Attending a twenty-minute religi-
ous service once a week, and knowing that the boy in the balcony
will mark us absent if we do not attend, is no sure road to salvation.
We come to think of chapel as a part of the weekly routine, like
winding the clock, feeding the goldfish, and washing the windows.
Religious and ethical concepts can not be forced into us.

We understand all this. But do we not learn something
from chapel, anyhow? A chapel service that is part of a time
schedule may not inspire us; but it reminds us, nevertheless, that
there are things beyond the happenings of the day, and beyond
the time schedule.

We can see the virtue of a voluntary chapel service, where
those who wished might attend, and those who did not wish need
not bother. But would many of us attend such a service? Would
not the best college chapel service in the world play to an empty
house on such terms? Do college students (or anybody else) choose
what is best for them?

Compulsion in college is simply an instrument of economy.
We are required to go to chapel at a certain hour, and to classes
at certain other hours, in order that the greatest possible number
of us may take advantage of a given lecture or exercise.

CLOSE QUARTERS
RESULTS IN
DIVORCONS

By John Allison

Close Quarters at the Blackstone
is that type; of show wherein the
beautiful lady is prevented f i;om mar-
rying the pure young hero because ot
a shady past. She finds him the right
man and he agrees that she is the
right woman but a sacrifice must be
mde in order to provide a scene of
anguish. The original story was
done by Dumas, the younger and has
eince suffered favorably at the hands
of Augustus Thomas. The theme is
trite and has been used an endless
number of times but never has it had
the galaxy of stars to put it across.
When a theater advertises an all star
cast it is always wise to see if there
is anybody of note in it. This con-
pany can rightfully boast of at least
seven people of star calibre. Miss
Ferguson, Effie Shannon and Mar-
garet Lawrence provide the female
end of the c?st. Miss Lawrence is
especially good and while she por-
trays a different type of character
than she did here last in “Secrets”
it only adds to her versatility. The
movies have given us -lots of Elsie
Ferguson but it waits for the stage
to use her glorious voice. The men
include Wallace Eddinger, Bruce
McRae, Percy Ames and Geoffrey
Kerr. All have appeared in Chicago
before even if only as leading men
for either Ethel Barrymore or Ina
Claire.

The down town dailies announce
that the same company sans one or
two will put on a French affair called
“Divorcons.” This begins Monday
and with the star lineup it should
prove an excellent attraction.

TEA FOR SENIOR
WOMEN HELD IN

IDA TOMORROW

Revive Custom Originated
By La Verne

Noyes

Senior women will come together
for the last class funciton of the year
at a party tomorrow from 4 to 6
in the library of Ida Noyes hall. The
event, traditional in the annals of
the building’s history, is being spon-
sored by the Ida Noyes Advisory
council.

Graduating Women Convene

The party is a revival of a cus-
tom originated several years ago by
Laverne Noyes, when the women’s
building was erected in memory of
his wife. He felt that the graduat-
ing women should be brought togeth-
er for an informal event before they
left the University. A tea or an
informal party has been given each
year in acordance with his plan.

Arrangements for the party are
in the hands of three members of
the Advisory council, Mary Monilaw,
Lucy Lamon and Winifred Williams.

Get the facts
about the Bond Business

THERE is a great deal of misinformation
among college men concerning the bond
business. Some think it is an easy, quick way to
large earnings. Others underestimate its possibil-
ities. The truth lies in between.

Businesses differ in the kinds of ability they
require. Some men who would succeed in one line
of business would only rut themselves in others.

We discuss these things frankly with college
men who are interested in entering the bond busi-
ness—whether they are undergraduates or men
who are not satisfied with the work they have
taken up since leaving college.

Every man we employ is given several months’
training, with pay,in our bond school before being
assigned to actual work. This serves to give the
man the best chance to succeed — and it also
protects our clientele from unsatisfactory service.

If Ion Are Interested

in the bond business as a vocation, we shall be glaa
to send you our pamphlet giving useful information.

FOUR TEAMS AFTER WEEKEND SCALPS

ROUSE BECOMES

THIRD INELIGIBLE

OF TRACK SQUAD

Shabinger and Boynton Are
Other Two Men
Off Team

Two things there are, it seems,
that the Maroon track team can be
sure of this season; first, lots of mis-
fortune in training, and second, and
worse, an over copious supply of
ineligibilities. During the early part
of the season the accidents that be-
fell the men while they were getting
into condition were alarmingly num-
erous and occurred at most unhappy
times—almost always just before a
big meet. But now the attack on the
Maroon team strength has shifted.
“Old man ineligibilities’’ is taking his
turn and his ruthless methods are
slowly but surely sapping the
strength of the cinder squad.

Three Men Ineligible

The latest victims to fall under
the dread scholastic ban are three
in number. Rouse, one of the squad’s
best discus hurlers, became ineligible
this week. In the Quadrangular meet
last Saturday he hurled the plate
125 feet, 7 inches, in an effort that
took third place among that note-
worthy company. Shabinger, Rouse’s
teammate in the weights, and the
best javelin thrower in the Univer-
sity, went under the ineligibles’ ban
at the same time. Shabinger, curi-
ously enough, has better than a “B”
average to date, but somehow he has
gone under this quarter. Then, on
top of all this came the announce-
ment of Holmes Boynton’s slump in
standing. Boynton has been one of
Chicago’s best bets in the mile all
during the season and in the last
dual meet, with Purdue, he took a
third in his event.

Mias Minnesota Dual Meet

Thus the three men are kept from
going to Minneapolis for the dual
meet with Minnesota next Saturday.
So that the Maroons, who otherwise
had an even chance to win out over
the Gophers, now find that they have
an uphill fight on their hands. For
the loss of Shabinger means the loss
of a first and five points in the jave-
lin, and the unwholesome prospect of
a slam for Minnesota in that event.
Boynton’s and Rouse’s absences from
the fray will mean another six dr
seven points gone. All o fwhich it is
hoped however will merely serve to
point the fighting Maroon spirit for
the event.

New Grid Elections

Cause of Comment

Stanford’s plan of electing a field
captain previous to each game and
an honorary cptain at the end of
the season has evoked a great deal
of comment on the coast. The Daily
Californian contains the following
two opinions:

Benton W. Holmes ’25, captain of
the 1926 Varsity basketball team—
“I think that the Stanford plan is
better. After a man has been elected
captain for a season he is apt to fall
down. People expect a captain to be
far better than the best of his men.
After all, a captain is not much more
than a figurehead.”

F. L. Kleeberger, chairman of the
physical education department—“The
system adopted at Stanford puts too
much power in the hands of coaches
that are not, as a rule, graduates of
the university at which they are
coaches.

Entries for Revue
Close Next Friday

Entries close this Friday at six
for the Annual Spring Carnival to
be held May 27th and 28th. Al-
ready most of the fraternity or-
ganizations have sent in their en-
try blanks filled out with the num-
ber and names of the men who
will compete for them.

It is expected that all the frat-
ernities and many non-Greek or-
ganizations will be entered in the
meet as was the case last year.
Besides, there are usually many
unattached men who compete in
this event.

It has finally been decided that
the revue will be held at Stagg
Field as a final tribute to the old
track before it is dismantled to
be replaced by the new one, run-
ning east-west instead of north-
south.

WHAT of IT?

MOggENSTERjj

Wake Burke, freshman mile star,
has a sad tale to tell about on these
spring days. Burke comes from Ten-
nessee, where there is no evolution,
and from Dyersburg (in Tennessee),
where there is no running water.
When the editor of the renowned
Dyersburg World-Herald found out
last fall that Burke was coming up
to Chicago to school, he contracted
with Burke to write bi-weekly ar-
ticles back home to the paper, set-
ting down such observations as would
come to a gentleman from Tennessee
in a city like Chicago.

In the course of time, Wake wrote
an article for the southern journal
built around the theme of shin-
splints, an ailment which, as a run-
ner, he had, of course, had acquaint-
ance. The article, innocent enough
in its appearance, precipitated an
uproar in Dyersburg unparalleled in
the annals of the town. Burke’s
mother wrote him, assuring him em-
phatically that, did ever such another
article appear in the Dyersburg paper
he would be forthright disowned. Old
school teachers, the mayor, next-door
neighbors—posted off letters deplor-
ing the evil that had crept into his
soul in the big city. For Wake.had
spread the gospel of evolution in his
story.

In his article, Burke related the
manner in which shin-splints evolved.
Our ancestors, he said, had original-
ly been three-boned fellows in their
legs. But, in pulling themselves up
trees, walking about when they felt
so disposed, and doing the other
things one does with one’s legs, these
remote members of the family saw
their three bones gradually unite into
one. And nowadays, Mr. Burke neat-
ly summed up, when a track man
gets shin-splints, after he has done
too much running, it is merely his
one-time three bones trying to pull
apart back into their former condi-
tion.

I feel a keen sympathy for Wake
in his hour of need. It is unfortun-
ate enough to have one’s mother
about one’s ears, but when one’s
school teachers and mayor join the
parade, one is inclined to get down-
right discouraged. I should suggest
as a possible means of getting back
into favor in Dyersburg that Wake
send back a report that John Thomas
Scopes, the hero of Dayton (now here
in school learning more heresies),
has flunked out in Zoology.

BALL ARTISTS TO

PLAY-OEE TITULAR

GAMES MONDAY

Kappa Nu’s Only Team.
Assured of Chance
To Play

Playground ball goes on merrily
apace. Postponements last week,
rain last week and both rain and post-
ponements today have all served to
keep it going on merrily and also
apace. The semi-finals, which were
expected for today will not come due
until Monday of next week. Today’s
games are all postponed until Thurs-
day because of the unfortunate ac-
tion of the elements yesterday after-
noon.

In each league there is an indi-
vidual mixup; for two or three teams
tied for the lead of almost every
one of the leagues. And still the
competition is waxing keener and
keener each day, for none of the
teams will give up the hope of league
championship.

Only one league has finished out
its schedule and has undisputed
champion in the field. The Gamma
preliminary round ended last week
when Kappa Nu won its way to vic-
tory over the Delta Sig after four-
teen innings of bitter battle.

Beta league is near the end of its
schedule with the final game for the
league championship scheduled for
Friday of this week. Pi Phi Pi will
play Sigma Nu for top honors. The
Pi Phi Pi teamwork will be pitted
against the experience of the Sigma
Nu outfit for the Sigma Nus have
been the University champions for
the last two years.

So intramural officials and inter-

ested fraternity group hope for
“break” from the elements.

a

POSTPONE I-M NET
MATCHES BECAUSE
OF BAD WEATHER

Because of the rain yesterday af-
ternoon, no intra-mural tennis match-
es were played off. This week’s play
is the third and accordingly, all third
round matches must be played off by
Friday afternoon or both contestants
will be disqualified.

At present the tourney is still a
free for all with no one in the lead.
There are many among the thirty
odd men remaining who have a good
chance of copping the title for 1926.
Shapinsky, star sophomore varsity
man, won this title last year and the
coaches are watching this meet for

more new material.

Among those who have showed
well in play already are J. Clark
Sigma Nu, Place of Beta Theta

up
of

Pi

and Chuck Gaskill of Delta Sigma
Phi and intra-mural fame in many
sports.

Burg Tells How
Psychology Aids
Record - Making

By Victor Roterus

“I attribute the extra six inches
to mental attitude,” Anton Burg,
high jumper extraordinary, declared
yesterday. This statement was in re-
ply to the question, “Here you’ve
been jumping around the 6 foot mark
for almost a winter. And then sud-
denly at Columbus you ascend the
bar at 6 feet 6 inches. How do you
account for it?”

Forced To Win

Then when the words “mental atti-
tude” failed to bring any sign of
accurate comprehension on the face
of the questionner Burg went on to
explain. “By mental attitude I mean
confidence and determination. The
last characteristic results when one
is being subject to strong pressure.
Anson of Ohio State kept equalling
my leaps up to six feet five inches,
some three inches more than I had
ever been able to do in practice. Rut

to beat Anson I was forced to
still higher.”

He illustrated what the lack
pressure or competition will do

go

of
by

using the high jumping event of the
Penn Relays as an example. Hore
Burg won first place with a leap of
6 feet 3 inches, but in an exhibition
attempt to break the Penn record at
6 feet 5 5-8 inches he failed to do
what he would have done under the
stress of competition. As he said, “I
think my jump was as good as the
one at Ohio State. Anyway I was
well over the bar, but I was inclined
to be careless and consequently
knocked the pole off with a dragging
foot. Now if someone had been
competing with me at this height I
would have utilized every ounce of
my strength and would have taken
care not to have left my foot drag.”

“Popular Belief Is True”

That the popular belief of “ris-
ing to the occasion” is no myth is
also well illustrated in the case of
Burg. Last year he was able to clear
only 5 feet 11 inches. But his jump-
ing was not needed, because of the
excellency of Russell. This year the
jumping burden was shifted to the
shoulders of Burg and he has more
than taken care of it.

He was just an eighth of an inch
short of the inter-collegiate record
at Columbus Saturday and he hopes
to break it during the Conference
meet at Iowa City a week from Sat-
urday when he will meet Anson and
McGinnis, who are capable of put-
ting Burg into the right “mental at-
titude” to break records. This will

Saturday

been roused to a high pitch by the
showing of the Norgrenites in the
last two games, the victories over
Illinois and Northwestern, and are
anxious to see them repeat against
the Boilermakers Saturday. A ten
day period since the Wildcat game
has afforded the team some valuable
practice games with the Frosh and
Industrial nines, and has given Nor-
gren a chance to polish up the new
combination made necessary by the
ineligibility of Wallie Marks.

Good playing by Roy Price, the
new first-baseman, has partially off-
set the great loss which Mark’s in-
eligibility brought to the hurling
staff. Bill Macklind, who pitched good
ball on the Japan trip, is counted on
to grace the mound should the pow-
erful Captain Joey Gubbins need his
help.

Maroons Improve

Consistent hitting and almost er-
rorless ball has characterized the re-
cent practice tilts of the Maroons,
and these factors should win many
more games, as they did the last
two. Hoerger, McConnell and Brig-
nail have kept up the batting pace
which they set in the Illini and Wild-
cat games, and the whole team has
been showing well in the field.

Purdue Strong

Purdue has a strong outfit this
year, having lead the Big Ten race
at the opening of the season, includ-
ing a 7 to 6 win over the Norgren-
ites at Lafayette. Coach Lambert
boasts one of the hardest hitting
nines in the conference, but poor
fielding has handicapped their play.
Northwestern, who also lost to Pur-
due in an early season contest, hand-
ed them an 8 to 4 setback at Evans-
ton last Saturday, which adds to the
Maroons hope for the coming contest.

game. Midway sport enthusiasts have

GRADES OF ATHLETES
HIGHER THAN AVERAGE

The revolutionary fact that major
sport athletes in the colleges have
made a higher average than the gen-
eral university grade has been re-
vealed by Fred Turner, assistant
dean of men at the University of Il-
linois.

Dean Turner’s research, published
recently in the “Big Ten Weekly,”
considered the scholastic work of
the members of the football, base-
ball, basketball and track teams for
five years. A grade of “C” is gen-
erally considered an average univer-
sity grade and of these twenty teams,
only one was below it. Track men
were the smartest, basketball, base-
ball and football following.

The general public seldom con-
siders that there are other student
activities besides athletics which re-
quire time. Dean Turner compared
the class-room exploits of the athletes
with the grades of students in four
outstanding activities. He found
that athletic managers and Y. M. C.
A. workers were first; track athletes
next; Student Union officers fourth
and basketball players fifth. Mem-
bers of the staff of the student daily
were sixth, baseball seventh and
football eighth. In two years the

^e his fourth meeting with this tai-1 football squad surpassed the editors

The outstanding ability, athletic
prowess, and all around leadership
of the entries in the World’s Great-
est Interscholastic, scheduled for
June 4 and 5 on Soldier’s Field is
very evident from a glance over the
records of the the men already signed
up for the meet.

Especially is this true of a man,
George Miller by name, that is enter-
ing from Havelock high school, lo-
cated at Havelock, Nebraska. Mil-
ler is completing his last year of piep
school competition and is entering
the National meet in search of a
crowning achievement of his four
year’s of work.

His record is practically unequalled
by any athlete in the United States
as an all around man. He is a star in
football, basketball, baseball and
track. During his high school career
he has been captain of a team in
every sport sponsored by the Have-
lock authorities.

On the cinder track, in the weight
events, and at the jumping standard.

hurdles, pole vaults, swings the dis-1
cus, .puts the shot, and twirls the |
hammer, at an equal rate. Recently
he broke the state record for the |
javelin throw.	•

Miller is just nineteen, weighs 165, ।
and the Western sport addicts pro-
claim him as the coming collegiate
wonder.

evenly balanced in Saturday’s track
meet according to the previous
showings of the two squads.

Like the Maroons, they have few-
outstanding men, but are stronger on
thetrack, while the Maroons have the
edge in the field events. Gruehagen,
stellar dash man and placer in the
Drake Relays, will boost the Gopher
hopes in the 100 and 220 dashes.

Hisert, Patterson, Dorsey and
Bartlett are expected to cop the golf
match at Illinois. This par-shooting
foursome has registered wins over
Iowa, Purdue, and Ohio, and has yet
to be defeated. The Maroon tennis
team has been less successful, hav-
ing only one victory to its credit, and
the meet with Wisconsin will un-
doubtedly be a close one.

What Is

Underwriter?

One who executes and delivers
a life insurance policy. In
other words, a person whose
business it is to offer the
known benefits of life insur-
ance to individuals, to corpor-
ations, to partnerships, etc.

But further, the life under-
writer is one who must con-
vince those clients of the
benefits offered. This means
stimulating contact with hu-
man character, and with large
affairs. Some underwriters
prefer the game of character
and deal mainly with indi-
viduals. Others prefer affairs;
to them is open the great field
of business insurance.

Furthermore, the business of
life underwriting pays highly
for initiative and ability.

And still more, the life under-
writer offers to his client a
commodity which has no risk
in it, does not deteriorate, and
adds no burden of mental
worry. The life underwriter
sells absolute security, the
foundationofserenity of mind.

It is worth while to think
these things over now and to
remember them when, per-
haps, you find yourself wrong-
ly placed in whatever business
you may ha’ e chosen.
