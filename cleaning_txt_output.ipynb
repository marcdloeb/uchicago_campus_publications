       "'SG elects Fortier president; by-law amendment adopted\\n\\nNew officer’s for the 1954-55 Student Government were the principal item of business for the first meeting of the new SG assembly last Tuesday.\\n\\nAl Fortier (ISL-col) was elected president of SG. Other officers elected were Emil John Writedns illegal, eight ballots void\\n\\nA major controversy in the re- Asked why he didn’t petition cent Student Government elec- and register as an official candison (ISL-col), vice-president; Sabina Wagner (ISL-col), secretary; and Pat Parker (ISLbus), treasurer.\\n\\nAn amendment to the SG by-laws was adopted which provides that any party receiving 25 per cent of the total vote in an SG election and holding a seat in the assembly is entitled to a committee-at-large, and thu S to a representative on the SG executive council. This gives the Student Representative party a seat on the council, which it would not otherwise have had.\\n\\nThe former by-law provided that any party with 20 per cent of the seats in SG was entitled to a committee-at-large. Clark Kucheman (ISL-FTS) proposed an amendment whereby this requirement could be waived by a two-thirds vote of the assembly. ,\\n\\nPhoto by Tipton\\n\\nAl Fortier, newly-elected Student Government president, discussing SG activities with members Jan Porter and Paul Bresiow.\\n\\ntions centered around the three seats in the Medical school. Although three positions were open to Med school candidates, SRP ran none, and ISL had only two.\\n\\nAfter the ballots were counted it was reported that eight of the Med school ballots had been counted as void because each had the name of Fred Solomon written in. Solomon thereupon contested the ruling that the ballots were invalid and asked for the rule which governed write-ins.\\n\\nThe rule governing write-ins, according to Jim Handler, chairman of the SG election and rules committee, is as follows: “Any writing on a ballot shall render the ballot void.” This rule is interpreted by the E and R committee to cover any and all writing.\\n\\nAnderson wants UC support:\\n\\nISL wins election\\n\\ntells why Douglas did not get here\\n\\nDouglas Anderson, Senator Douglas’ Illinois representative, denied categorically that he had ever spurned the support of the Independent\\n\\ndate, Solomon replied:\\n\\n“For personal reasons I did not know until late last week that I could spend any time in Student Government.\\n\\n“In this context,” he added, “writing means extraneous remarks, defamatory remarks after a candidate’s name, and the like. It does not mean ‘no write-in votes allowed.’ I assumed a democratic election would allow a voter to vote for candidates of his choice, whether or not their names appeared on the ballot.”\\n\\nAt the Student Government meeting last Tuesday, Jerry Zisook moved that Solomon be seated as the third Med school delegate. Eli Stein immediately challenged that the motion was out of order and suggested that the ruling could be brought up in Student - Faculty - Administration court. The motion was declared out of order by the chair.\\n\\nAward Fulbright to Towle at last\\n\\nin 42 seat landslide\\n\\nvoters of Illinois and groups at the University of Chicago.\\n\\nAnderson maintained that the only reason that Douglas was unable to appear on campus was that Douglas had previously scheduled meetings with the IVI in the fifth, second, and seventh wards that same\\n\\nFor the first time in Student Government history a political party captured all but three seats, as the Independent Students League won 42 of 45 contested positions in the all-campus election last week.\\n\\nStudent Representative party candidates were elected to fill one position in the college, one in the social sciences division, and one in the federated theological schools. There were no independent candidates on this year’s slate.\\n\\nThis election, described by Clive Gray (ISL), last year’s SG president, as the “biggest landslide a party ever had,” gave ISL control of SG for the sixth time since ISL’s inception in 1948. •\\n\\nTwo seats in the assembly are vacant. At the first SG meeting held last Tuesday, Al Fortier was elected president, thereby relinquishing his seat as a delegate. The other vacancy is in the medical school, where only two of three seats were filled. SRP had no candidates in this division.\\n\\nApproximately 32 per cent of the total student body cast about fifteen hundred ballots. This vote is 4% less than the 36% that voted in last year’s election, and 5% less than the record vote of 37% in 1952. Three schools were uncontested, and had a very light\\n\\nvote this year.\\n\\nISL candidates received 62.2% and SRP candidates 37.8% of the total votes cast for individual candidates.\\n\\nIn the following tabulation of the election results by divisions and schools, winning candidates are listed in boldface type.\\n\\nnight. Douglas, he said, “was eager to speak on the campus if an open date could be arranged.” Ralph Fertig, who maintains that Anderson had made the controversial statements in a telephone talk with him, agreed that this was the reason that Douglas could nut appear.\\n\\nAnderson called it inconceivable that he could have made such remarks. He said he was a founder of the Americans for Democratic Action and had worked on arrangements that were to unite the\\n\\nIVI with the ADA.\\n\\nAnderson said that Fertig had “gone off on his own hook” making arrangements for speakers on the strength of Douglas’ name before final arrangements had been made with Anderson.\\n\\nFertig and John Gilmore, who made calls to Barratt O\\'Hara, Democratic incumbent from the second Congressional district, and other notables scheduled to appear at the rally, denied Anderson\\'s allegation.\\n\\nDr. Charlotte Towle, who was denied a Fulbright scholarship by the foreign scholarship board in Washington in September of this year, has been granted the Fulbright upon reconsideration of the board. Professor Towle will lecture on generic social case work at the London School of Economics, starting in January.\\n\\nDr. Towle, professor of social service administration at UC, is believed to have been originally denied the Fulbright because she urged clemency for the Rosenbergs and because she belonged to an organization advocating aid to the Spanish loyalists.\\n\\nBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES\\n\\n(two elected)\\n\\nMarty Gouterman 31 (ISL)\\n\\nGary Friedman 33 (ISL)\\n\\nLawrence Lichtenstein 22 (SRP)\\n\\nJoseph Yavit 21 (SRP)\\n\\nBUSINESS SCHOOL ’\\n\\nl’at Parker 11 (ISL)\\n\\nCOLLEGE\\n\\nPhoto by Tipton\\n\\nSG ballots being counted.\\n\\n(13 elected)\\n\\nJan Metros Al Fortier E.

In the final round, the judge, in violation of tournament tradition, allowed the decision to be made by a Purdue girls’ speech class who witnessed the debate. The girls voted 15 to 13 for the opposition.\\n\\nThe score sheet of the judge had indicated a tie, a situation in which the verdict ordinarily goes to tile negative, since the affirmative bears the burden of proof and is bound to demonstrate some advantage for its side.\\n\\n“The success of Chicago in the 16-team tourney was based upon its previous analysis of the question rather than on speaking skill,” stated Marv Phillips, Forum director. “Many of the issues which the team had rejected as indefensible in their preparation for the meet were found to be the basis of opposition arguments. Our prior determination of the\\n\\nweaknesses in these arguments gave the UC team a considerable advantage.\\n\\n“It appeared,” he added, “that most of the other teams had built cases upon shades of meaning in the topic itself, intending to surprise their opponents, rather than upon real life attitudes on the question. Since most teams anticipated such tactics the element\\n\\nof surprise lay solely with the Chicago team which had followed the latter course.”\\n\\nThe next tournament Chicago will attend is to be held at Brandley on November 19. In the meantime debates with the larger colleges are being schduled on the UC campus to give the student body an opportunity to see the debate team.\\n\\nUniversity debaters, who participated in a tournament at Purdue university Saturday.

Kimpton’s statement criticizing the Free University of Berlin which appeared in last week’s Maroon was issued Wednesday by professor Hirsch, the Free University’s president.\\n\\nHirsch came to the UC campus as part of his visit to this country for the Bi-centennial celebration of Columbia university.\\n\\nHirsch was puzzled by Kimpton’s statement that an “air of fright” surrounds the Free university. \"There is no such ‘fright’ surrounding the university,” Hirsch commented, “and as to the endless checking of passports to which Mr. Kimpton referred, passpoets are checked only when you enter the country and when you leave.”\\n\\n“The Free university has developed by leaps and bounds,” he commented. It now has an exchange program with Stanford and Columbia for professors and witii Stanford, Columbia, and Harvard for students; the Free university was the first German university to give extension courses at night.\\n\\nThe needs of a new university are very large, stated Hirsch, and some are impossible to supply; a great deal of help, however, has come from the US through the Ford and Rockefeller foundations and the State department.\\n\\nHirsch said that 40% of the Free university’s students originally came from the Soviet zone of Berlin, and a few commute regularly between the Soviet zone and the university.\\n\\nOrgan concert at Rockefeller service\\n\\nRichard Luecke, a candidate for the Ph.D. in philosophy at UC and Pastor of Our Savior’s Lutheran Church, Chicago, will preach the sermon at the ninth annual reformation vespers at Rockefeller chapel, Sunday at 8 p.m.\\n\\nThe 16th century liturgical service, sung in Gregorian by the Valparaiso University choir, Valparaiso, Indiana, will be preceded by an organ concert at 7:30 p.m., played by Heinrich Fleischer, UC organist.\\n\\nMead says tolerance forced on Protestants\\n\\n“Religious toleration was universal in the English colonies by the middle of the 18th century, but Protestantism did not contribute to this religious liberty. It was forced into it,” concluded Sidney E. Mead, associate professor of history of American Christianity.\\n\\nMead spoke in the first of a series of four Walgreen foundation lectures on “The shape of Protestantism in America,” last Monday. This first lecture, “From coercion to persuasion,” dealt with the development of religious toleration in early colonial America.\\n\\nMead pointed out that early Protestant aims to establish religious coercion in the new world were frustrated by a variety of outside influences. The self-interest of individuals caused them to forget the cries of the church when it interfered with their personal ambitions; the vast spaces of the new land made banishment an enlargement of opportunity rather than a confinement; and England exerted pressure for a more tolerant attitude on religious matters in New England.\\n\\nBesides these influences, “a strange alliance developed between the rationalists and the pietist revivalists which forewarded the cause of religious\\n\\nC\\'shop drops all hoars after five\\n\\nC-shop hours have again been limited to 7:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Lack of student support was given by Robert M.

This alliance was purely practical and not theoretical. The rationalist approach to religious freedom, based on the intellectual conception that all religions good enough to preserve peace and order have a right to exist, could not be reconciled with that of the revivalists who, while having no interest in conformity, had no intellectual interest in anything.\\n\\nNevertheless, Mead continued, this alliance, combined with the earlier factors of self-interest, vast spaces, and pressure from the old world, brought American Protestantism—-in spite of itself — still further down the road toward religious toleration.\\n\\n’New year in Nov.\\' festival\\n\\nA “New Year in November” atmosphere will prevail at the Dewali festival 4 p.m. Sunday in the assembly hall of International house.\\n\\nFeatured for the afternoon will be movies pertaining to the meaning of Dewali, authentic Indian foods, and native Indian dances by Mehta Von Essen and Nina Guha.\\n\\nSponsored by the India Association, this Dewali festival celebrates the opening of the new year on the Indian lunar calendar, and is open to all those wishing to learn about the festival.\\n\\nDewali. the only national Indian holiday, is a traditional time of gaiety and friendliness and marks the end of the Indian fiscal year.

Ward managing editor\\n\\nEditorial\\n\\nMAROON prints all news\\n\\nFor quite a while now it has become less fashionable to revile the Maroon for faults which range from a mere vicious slanting of one story to hatching of vast conspiracies designed to subvert the government (SG, of course).\\n\\nSo we are sorry to note that once again we have to defend ourselves for doing something which it is our duty and our stated purpose to do: provide an unbiased coverage for all the news in an unbiased fashion, no matter how much the content or what we write might please or displease us.\\n\\nWe refer here to the story about Senator Paul H. Douglas which appeared in the last issue of our paper. We are told that this story is detrimental to the cause of the senator’s re-election.\\n\\nWe might remind our critics that the Maroon has not declared itself either for or against Douglas, that even if we were supporting the senator editorially, the practice of printing or suppressing news in line with orfe’s editorial policy i§ more suited to certain Chicago metropolitan papers than to ourselves. If the facts printed in the story are the truth, then it is the actions of the persons involved that do, or do not, reflect upon the various personalities.\\n\\nWe still propose to print all the news which we believe to be of interest to the student body. If this means stepping on the toes of particular interests, then we can only hope that the bones involved are sound enough to stand it.\\n\\nfrom the Democratic and Republican parties. In many cases, candidates and their friends put tremendous pressures on members of our Board of Directors in an attempt to Influence them. (You can be sure such pressures had no effect.) Never has the IVI endorsement been so eagerly sought as this year. Many candidates told us frankly that if the usual close county vote prevails the IVI endorsement will determine the outcome of several county races.\\n\\nNot only did Joseph Meek and Senator Douglas eagerly seek the IVI endorsement, but Senator Douglas has given full cooperation to our various district campaign committees. He has gone out of his way to appear at some of our public meetings. (Last February he flew from Washington to appear with Adlai Stevenson and Arch Carey at our 10th anniversary celebration.\\n\\nAnd our members have enthusiastically supported Senator Douglas because^ of his intelligence and devotion, because of his great fights on off-shore oil, his selfless attempts to wake up Americans to the need for economic planning to avert depression, and his strong support of the UN and economic aid to underdeveloped areas. It is a great record.\\n\\nWe hope that students, faculty and all others associated with your great university will go on giving support to America’s Number One Senator, just as they have in the past.\\n\\nLeon M. Despres, Choirman\\n\\nJames V. Cunningham. Jr.\\n\\nExecutive Director I.V.I.\\n\\nagreed to fly in from Detroit for the occasion and speak for the candidates. Mr. Cass initiated arrangements for procuring the Field House, and had received the consent of the proper administration personnel.\\n\\nBefore submitting a story on the meeting to the MAROON, on Wednesday, Oct. 13, I again checked with Miss Malone at the Democratic Party. She assured me that all publicity could be issued. That evening Mr. Anderson got in touch with me. He Informed me that the Democratic Party officials had made an honest and innocent mistake in scheduling Douglas for our proposed gathering. The Democratic Party, he explained, has priority over all other appointments, but this priority can only be utilized for Its ward meetings, and could not be extended to other groups such as ours. Mr. Anderson then made those statements which have formed the basis of controversy on last Friday’s article.\\n\\nI cancelled the MAROON story which announced our proposed Mass Meeting, and, in so doing, urged the editors of the MAROON to pursue the matter no further. Nothing appeared that week. The following week, I was Interviewed for the story. By then, rumors and reporters had it that the remarks derogatory to UC and to IVI were the Senator’s and not those of his assistant. I urged the MAROON to make It clear that there was no reason to believe that the stated positions were those of Mr. Douglas. There is still no evidence of the Senator’s holding such beliefs on the matter,\\n\\nand his welcoming of IVI support in the precincts and in his remarks at meetings would tend to indicate a difference of opinion.\\n\\nMr. Anderson has subsequently issued Identical remarks to a women connected with the IVI on the North Side. This woman reported the comments to the Political Action Personnel of the IVI IVI has had the good sense to discuss this problem of a highly paced advisor rejecting the support of liberals rather than denouncing those who report such discouraging remarks.\\n\\nRalph D.

No such meeting had ever been screduled by Students for Douglas. The Mr. Fertig that you mentioned is not and never has been a member of our organization.\\n\\nThe article went on to say that “the director of the Speakers Bureau of the Democratic Party in Cook County had told members of the Students for Douglas organization on campus to go ahead with publicity on Douglas’ appearance.” No member of Students for Douglas ever spoke with the Speakers Bureau. We have had no contact with them, whatsoever.\\n\\nThe article called Mr. Douglas Anderson the “administrative assistant to Douglas.” Mr. Anderson does not and never has held this position. Mr. Anderson is the Illinois representative of the Senator.\\n\\nThe article attributed to Mr. Anderson, the statement “Campaigning at the University of Chicago is the kiss of death” and further stated that “he expressed the wish that people at the University and the Independent Voters of Illinois, would not endorse Douglas,” allegedly because the Senator wished to disassociate himself from their “.radical political elements.”\\n\\nMr. Andrson has assured us that he has never made such a statement to any person, and that they are not his views. We can assure you that he has never made such a statement to Students for Douglas. Anyone who knows the Senator and is familiar with his record knows that they are not the views of Senator Douglas. All one need do is pick up a phone and call Mr. Anderson (as we did upon seeing the article), to confirm this.\\n\\nSenator Douglas has spoken in this campaign before numerous IVI meetings and has the whole-hearted support of that organization. Only a week ago Tuesday he addressed an IVI meeting at their Hyde Park headquarters at 1412 E. 55th Street.\\n\\nThe Senator has always been proud of his more than 26 year association with the University of Chicago, and has openly welcomed the support of its students and faculty, many of whom are now actively campaigning for his re-election.\\n\\nThis past Monday a representative of Douglas* campaign headquarters appeared at a Students for Douglas meeting on campus to enlist the service of students as poll-watchers, etc. The Senator’s wife, Mrs. Emily Taft Douglas, former Congresswoman - at - large from Illinois spoke on campus this past Tuesday at another sponsored meeting. Pick up any one of the numerous campaign pamphlets put out by Douglas’ campaign headquarters and you will discover what prominence the Senator’s long tenure at the U. of C. is given. Are these the ways one goes about “disassociating Douglas” name from the University?\\n\\nSumming up: the entire article In last week’s Maroon was from beginning to end a long list of prevarications, some of which, for the sake of conserving space, we have even neglected to mention in this letter. The atricle was not submitted by Students for Douglas, or by any member thereof. Students for Douglas knew nothing about the article until the Maroon published it. We are at a loss to know why the name of our organization was mentioned in the article. It sounded as though inspired and written by a “Student for Meek.”\\n\\n* Don Coss\\n\\nDavid A.

A few facts make this clear.\\n\\nBoth Joseph Meek and Senator Douglas actively sought the endorsement of the IVI, as did ninety other candidates\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL HOUSE MOVIES\\n\\nAssembly Hall, Monday and Thursday Evenings at 8:30 P.M.\\n\\nMonday, Nov. 1 — ANA - TA - HAN (The Devil’s Pitchfork) (Japanese American)\\n\\nThursday, Nov. 4—BELL FOR ADANO (American)\\n\\nEditor’s note: The story, appearing in last week’s Maroon, was written from information supplied by Ralph Fertig, at that time, chairman of the citizen’s committee for Barrett O’Hara. Douglas Anderson was not available for comment up to the time of publication.\\n\\nThe Maroon apologizes that this was not made clear in the story or headline as printed. For Fertig’s comments on the story read below.\\n\\nOur apologies also go to Frank Mc Culloch, Senator Douglas’ administrative assistant, whose title was given to Douglas Anderson, the senator’s Illinois representative.\\n\\nStudent explains Douglas story\\n\\nA great deal of confusion and concern has been called to my attention with reference to last week’s MAROON article on the abandoned Mass Meeting for Senator Douglas. While we who are engaged in electioneering may doubt the practical advantage of such a story — and I had grave misgiving’s about its appearance — the story was thoroughly accurate in its detail.\\n\\nIt is a sad commentary on Liberals that so many are prepared to throw to the winds freedom of the press when it ill suits a liberal candidate to have a story featured on him which is otherwise relevant to the paper’s readership. The continued attacks upon the Integrity of my co-workers in the campaign for Douglas, O’Hara, and Lohman compel me to explain in greater detail the entire situation which led up to the printing of last Friday’s story.\\n\\nAfter a conference with Director of Student Activities, William Birenbaum. held Tuesday, October 12, the Chairman of Students for Douglas, Don Cass, and I, speaking for the Committee for Barratt O’Hara agreed to co-sponsor the two candidates with other big name speakers at a Mass Meeting for the campus. Mr. Cass agreed to make arrangements for a location, and I was to contact Douglas and O’Hara. Mr. Douglas and his administrative assistant, Mr. Anderson, were both out of town. I was informed by their office that the Democratic party also schedules Douglas, and so I contacted the appropriate personnel there. Miss Jerry Malone, head of the Speakers Bureau at the Democratic Party Headquarters assured me we could have Douglas for Monday evening, October 18. Barratt O’Hara arranged his schedule for that same evening, and Mr. Emil Mazey, Secretary-Treasurer of the UAW-CIO\\n\\nB a*\\n\\n* s\\n\\nI\\n\\nB\\n\\nB\\n\\nB\\n\\nI g\\n\\nE E\\n\\nSCHNEEMANN’S\\n\\nRed Door Book Shop\\n\\n1328 East 57th Street\\n\\nNOrmal 7-6111\\n\\nAnnouncement of Our Winter\\n\\nthe book-cellar\\n\\nWeekdays 10:00 A.M. to\\n\\nSundays 2:00 P.M. to\\n\\nthe used book room\\n\\n4:00 P.M. to 10:00\\n\\nHours\\n\\nI\\n\\nE\\n\\nB\\n\\nB\\n\\n10:00\\n\\n10:00\\n\\nP.M.\\n\\n6 I\\n\\nB\\n\\nM\\n\\nc\\n\\nC\\n\\nB\\n\\nE\\n\\nThe shop will Hose WEDNESDAY evenings\\n\\nI B\\nw\\n\\n \\n\\n| RE - ELECT |\\n\\nI SEN.

The trunk, too, will be gone within three years. It is now completely dead, and bark will begin to drop off during the coming year.\\n\\nWhen no new branches appeared last spring, the tree was diagnosed as dead; cause of death: thirst.\\n\\nHaving grown in its late location since 1893, the tree enjoyed a\\n\\nworld wide reputation and has been granted coverage in such publications as International News report.

The first movement is a rather effective display piece, but the tepid and aimless slow movement and the rcpe.titive third became very tiresome with their unpianistic conception.\\n\\nAlthough the Bartok pieces from Mikrokosmos were particularly well done, the high point of the recital was, curiously, n o t originally written for two pianos, not was it on the printed program.\\n\\nEven considering the limitations of the literature, one would\\n\\nhave preferred hearing fewer piano versions of orchestra pieces. The 19th - century - style arrangement of a Bach chorale prelude which served as an encore rather accentuated this impression.\\n\\nThis was a remarkable arrangement of Debussy\\'s Fetes by Maurice Ravel, which the duo played with much spirit and feeling, although it could hardly replace the orchestral version. Ravel’s own Feria was considerably less effective.\\n\\nBob Bloch\\n\\nPlaywrights Theatre Club 1205 N.

Both are approximajfcely the same magnitude in significance: Gaslight is based bn frankly melodramatic premises, while La Ronde is from Schnitzler’s tracky psychological trifle.\\n\\nThey differ simply in that La Ronde is a distressingly poor film while Gaslight is a work of consummate craftmanship.\\n\\nThe problem of understanding why one film is a .failure and the other is not, in this case, resolves itself into seeing what characteristic stylistic elements, what approach to subject matter and the film medium each director has utilized.\\n\\nOphuls doomed himself to almost certain failure by the use of devices that just never seem to be convincing on the screen.\\n\\nChief among there was the use of a “Mr. Fate” character to further the action. And it wasn’t merely the off-key- singing and horrendous posturing of Mr. Walbrook that caused this.\\n\\nPlacement of the action in the context of a never-never-land betrays the most fundamental principle of convincing cinema.\\n\\nThe basis for Dickinson’s style lies in the realization that any characters or devices interposed between direct visual presentation of the action tend to destroy the unity and rhythm of the film.\\n\\nDickinson is a master of using objects in a way that illuminates and interacts with the world of character and action.\\n\\nIn the opening sequence, the slashed furniture a demented murderer leaves in the wake of his search reflects the chaos of his mind, the frenzy of his action, and the condition of his victim, now dying as just such a bundle of useless rubbish.\\n\\nAgain in the flickering of the\\n\\ngaslight as the husband leaves the attic we feel the emotional fluttering of his wife’s fears, doubts and anguish as she lies on hei\\' bed. In themselves trifles, these devices become significant when they make up the complex seam less texture of the film. Perhaps it is this element of not being told everything, of participating in more than a passive way, that sets the difference between good and poor cinema.\\n\\nF. G.

Though her passing grieved me, it was some satisfaction to be able to grant her last wish — to be buried at sea — which is no small task when you live in Pierre, South Dakota.\\n\\nWith the dinner guests fed and the cook laid to her watery rest, I put out the cat and turned to the problem of Homecoming.\\n\\nFirst of all, let us define Homecoming. Homecoming is a weekend when old graduates return to their alma maters to see a football game, ingest great quantities of food and drink, and inspect each other\\'s bald spot!#\\n\\nThis occasion is marked by the singing of old songs, the slapping of old backs, and the frequent utterance of such outcries as “Harry, you old polecat!” or \"Harry, you old rooster!” or \"Harry, you old wombat!” or \"Harry, you old mandrill!” All old grads are named Harry.\\n\\nDuring Homecoming the members of the faculty behave with unaccustomed animation. They laugh and smile and pound backs and keep shouting, \"Harry, you old retriever!” These unscholariy actions are performed in the hope that the old grads, in a transport of bonhomie, will endow a new geology building.\\n\\nThe old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time on Saturday, their backs are so sore, their eyes so bleary, and their livers so sluggish that it is impossible to get a kind word out of them, much less a new geology building. \"Hmphh!” they snort as the home team completes a 101 yard march to a touchdown. \"Call that football? Why, back in my day they’d have been over on the first down. By George, football was football back in those days — not this namby pamby girls game that passes for football today. Why, look at that bench. Fifty substitutes sitting there! Why, in my day, there were eleven men on a team and that was it. When you broke a leg, you got taped up and went right back in. Why, I remember the big game against State. Harry Wallaby, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. I mean he was pronounced dead. But did that stop old Harry? Not on your tintype! Back in he went and kicked the winning drop-kick in the last four seconds of play, dead as he was. Back in my day, they played fool bull, by George!”\\n\\nEverything, say the old grads, was better back in their day — everything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the old grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a smoke like today’s vintage Philip Morris — never anything so mild and pleasing, day in day out, at study or at play, in sunshine or in shower, on grassy bank or musty taproom, afoot or ahorse, at home or abroad, any time, any weather, anywhere.\\n\\nI take up next another important aspect of Homecoming — the decorations in front of the fraternity house. Well do I remember one Homecoming of my undergraduate days. The game was against Princeton. The Homecoming slogan was \"Hold That Tiger!” Each fraternity house built a decoration to reflect that slogan, and on the morning of the game a group of dignitaries toured Fraternity Row to inspect the decorations and award a prize for the best.\\n\\nThe decoration chairman at our house was an enterprising young man named Rex Sigafoos, nephew of the famous lepidopterist. Rex surveyed Fraternity Row, came back to our house and said, \"All the other houses are building cardboard cages with cardboard tigers inside of them. We need to do something different — and I’ve got it. We’re going to have a real cage with a real tiger inside of it —a snarling, clawing, slashing, real live tiger!”\\n\\n\"Crikey!” we breathed. \"But where will you get him?”\\n\\n\"I’ll borrow him from the zoo,” said Rex, and sure enough, he did.\\n\\nWell sir, you can imagine what a sensation it was on Homecoming morning. The judges drove along nodding politely at cardboard tigers in cardboard cages and suddenly they came to our house. No sham beast in a sham cage here! No sir! A real tiger in a real cage — a great striped jungle killer who slashed and roared and snarled and dashed himself against the bars of his cage with maniacal fury.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that we would have easily taken first prize had not the tiger knocked out the bars of the cage and leaped into the official car and devoured Mr. August Schlemmer, the governor of the state, Mr. Wilson Ardsley Devereaux, president of the university, Dr. O. P. Gransmire, author of A Treasury of the World’s Great Southpaws: An Anthology of Left Hand Literature, Mr. Harrison J. Teed, commissioner of weights and measures, Mrs. Amy Dorr Nesbitt, inventor of the clarinet, Mr. Jarrett Thrum, world’s 135 pound lacrosse champion, Mr. Peter Bennett Hough, editor of the literary quarterly Spasm, and Mrs. Ora Wells Anthony, first woman to tunnel under the North Platte River. ©Max shuiman, 1954\\n\\nThis column is brought to you by the makers of PHILIP MORRIS who think you would enjoy their cigarette.\\n\\nNow back to a full staff of 6 Barbers\\n\\nat the\\n\\nREYNOLDS CLUB\\n\\nBARBER SHOP\\n\\n57<h AND UNIVERSITY\\n\\nWaiting time will be a minimum\\n\\n9-5 Mon. - Fri. — 9-1 Saturday\\n\\noil\\n\\nBROOKS BROTHERS SPORTWEAR an interesting new selection that\\'s colorful, exclusive and distinctive\\n\\nWe’ve an outstanding selection of new Fall sportwear items...including lightweight wool jersey knit sport jackets, miniature Tartan wool Odd Vests, tanlovat covert Odd Trousers... and a host of practical, attractive outerwear items, sport shirts, sweaters, etc.... as well as all our traditional favorites.\\n\\nCatalogue upon request.\\n\\nSSTABLISHID 1l1t\\n\\nliens furnishings, flats ^f hoes\\n\\n346 MADISON AVENUE, COR. 44TH ST., NEW YORK 17, N. Y. BOSTON • CHICAGO • LOS ANGELES • SAN FRANCISCO\\n\\nsaved by the Illini goalie.\\n\\nThe second half began auspiciously for Chicago. In what was perhaps the finest solo play of the year, Godfrey dribbled the ball forty yards into the Navy Pier goal.\\n\\nChicago elation was shortlived, however. Fifteen seconds later the Illini roared down the field, drew goalie Jerry Czamanske out of position, and gave Ihor Dachnivsky a chance to tap the ball into the net to event the score. 2-2.\\n\\nThe winning goal came late in the last quarter when a long, fast ground ball took a tremendous hop over the Maroon goalkeeper\\'s head, surprising everyone.
