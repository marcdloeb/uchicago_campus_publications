The UC delegates received their
posts during a campus-wide elec-

tion has been holding weekly
summer meetings at which poli-
cies for delegation have been dis-
cussed.

L«rge*t student group

NSA is the largest American
student organization. More than
300 college and University stu-
dent bodies having a combined
enrollment of over 1,000,000 are
represented by NSA. Its annual
Congress serves to formulate ma-
jor policies for the organization.

The Congress serves as forum
where problems facing the Amer-
ican student are discussed and
acted upon. Two main types of
resolutions are consider, those
which are to be executed by the

Chancellor Kimpton and other
Chicago leaders took a oneday
trip to Washington last month and
won federal approval for the
South East Chicago commission’s
twenty-million dollar redevelop-
ment program. Last week the
Chicago city council gave its go-
ahead to the project.

Kimpton and the others met
with Albert M. Cole, chairman of
the federal housing authority, and
with James W. Follin, head of the
slum clearance and urban rede-
velopment division of the home
finance agency.

Problems which the Congress
will concern itself range from the
running of student governments,
elimination of discriminatory
practices in education, academic
freedom, to relations of US and
foreign students.

More than 600 delegates will
attend the Congress meeting in 22
subcommissions, each concerned
with a different phase of student
life. Resolutions originating in
the subcommissions are consid-
ered by four main commissions
and then by a plenary of all con-
gress delegates.

College Students
Get Reclassified

Students are no longer classi-
fied as “college” students by the
registrar. Instead, they are called
“undergraduates” and their regis-
tration cards are marked “U.”

“Undergraduates” are further
classed as “old plan” (those re-
ceiving the Hutchins’ plan de-
gree), “new plan’’ (those
receiving the new four-year gen-
eral studies degree), or “early
entrant” (those who have not yet
received their twelfth grade cer-
tificate).

Students in a specialized pro-
gram are listed by their specialty,
creating a total of ten classifica-
tions replacing “college.”

Registrar William E. Scott ex-
plained that the new system of
classification “serves its function
of telling how many people are
working toward a particular de-
gree.”

Lobbies for Plan

pattern for similar projects ad-
joining universities and colleges
in other metropolitan areas,
Eisenhower also confided to
Kimpton: Columbia University
had a similar problem.

Co'e told Washington reporters
that “he was in a position to give
favorable consideration.” He
called the presentation of the
plans "one of the finest we’ve had.
It’s a good illustration of the
splendid teamwork Chicago has
presented here before.”

Covers 47 Acres **

The SECC proposal will cover
a 47.3 acre site between Kimbark
and the Illinois Central tracks,
from 57th to 53rd. This “slum
and blighted area” will be leveled
and redeveloped with new homes,
shops, streets and parks. Residen-
tial buildings will include town
houses, double maisonette and
elevator apartments.

Lake Park will be converted into
a major north-south thoroughfare

major addresses will be given by Robert G. Storey, dean of the
college of law at Southern Methodist university in Dallas,
Texas, and immediate past

president of the bar associa-
tion; and by Henry F. Tenney,
vice president of the University
board of trustees.

Thompson at Ceremony

William J. Jameson of Billings,
Montana, president of the Ameri-
can Bar Association, will preside
during the ceremonies and John
B. Thompson, dean of the chapel,
will give the invocation and bene-
diction. Music will be provided
by the University of Chicago
choir and Dr. Heinrich Fleischer,
chapel organist.

A ceremonial processional of
over 500 persons will form in
Ida Noyes hall before the dedi-
cation and will march to the
chapel. Jurists will wear judicial

Included in this processional
will be the Chief Justice and other
justices of the Supreme Court;

planned under Illinois’ new urban
renewal plan law.

Demolish Buildings

All but eight buildings within
the redevelopment area will be
demolished. In the place of the
torn down buildings will be 712
new dwellings, 400 elevator apart-
ments, 186 maisonettes and 126
row houses. At present. 41 per
cent of the deteriorated buildings
in Hyde Park are within the re-
development area.

All that is lacking for work to
begin on the project is state ap-
proval.

Others on the Washington dele-
gation included: Albert C. Svo-

schools and members of the bar
association’s house of delegates
and board of governors, state and
local presidents and committee
chairmen; as well as representa-
tives of learned societies and af-
filiated legal organizations.

After the dedication a reces-

THE CHICAGO MAROON

August 6, 1954

Mrs. Fermi Tells Wife's
Reactions to A-Research

Pass Test in Struggle

For Better Neighborhood

Recently the administration of this university passed the
first major test in its struggle for neighborhood improvement.
The proposal to redevelop certain sections of the Hyde Park
area has become the first urban renewal plan in the United
States to receive official federal recognition.

Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton, trustee chairman Ed-
ward L. Ryerson and other delegates were successful in their
attempts to,get guarantees of federal funds for the plan —
and support from President Eisenhower.

Dr. Cyril Smith once told Mi’s. Laura Fermi: “You should write your husband’s biography.**
She replied: “My husband is the man I cook for and iron shirts for. How can I take him
that seriously?”

Yet, as Mrs. Fermi relates, the seed was sown and it produced what promises to be one
of the most interesting books of the year. “Atoms in the family” is the stoty of Enrico Fermi,
the Italian-born atomic scientist who won the Nobel prize, the Congressional Medal for Merit
and was the leader of the research team which created the first self - sustaining chain
reaction.

Mrs. Fermi is unawed by the scientific renown her husband has achieved. She disects

The urban renewal plan — involving 47 acres of blighted
land in two irregular shaped sites, one centered around Lake
Park and 55th, and the other roughly bounded by 53rd, 54th,
Kimbark and Blackstone — has been referred to by Chan-
cellor Kimpton as “ a model for the redevelopment of other
neighborhoods.”

This is the first concrete step in the University’s long-stand-
ing struggle to off-set the oft-exaggerated but sometimes
well-founded rumors concerning blight and deterioration in
the immediate University neighborhood.

Although some details of the South East Chicago commis-
sion’s plan for the redevelopment of these two areas have
been questioned by some civic leaders, there is no question
that some form of neighborhood redevelopment is necessary
for the continued prestige and future growth of the University
of Chicago.

Although we may hold some reservations about the details
of the plan, we cannot fail to rejoice with the Chancellor
and his associates on their success toward the goal of neigh-
borhood improvement.

in a humorous vein the men
who shared the “most dread-
ful secret known to man” —
Einstein, Bohr, Urey, Oppen-
heimer, Groves, Teller and the
two who deflected to the commu-
nist cause. She pinpoints their
quirks and weaknesses and gives

a domestic outlook on the work at
Stagg Field and Los Alamos.

Bar Center Has Vital

Significance for UC

Next week, after a year in construction, the American Bar
Association dedicates its national headquarters on the Mid-
way. It is an important occasion quite apart from any rela-
tion it may have with the University. For with five-thousand
of the country’s leading lawyers, judges, and legal educators
in attendance and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
making the dedication speech it may well turn out to be, as
the Bar Association predicts, “the largest assemblage of legal
dignitaries since the dedication of the U. S. Supreme Court
building in 1932.”

But the event has a different and far more vital significance
for the University.

When the dedication is over and the center staff gets down
to work it will be to consider scientifically “the long range
legal problems that affect the public welfare.” The center, in
short, has been planned as an intellectual center for the
organized bar of the United States.

Such an intellectual center constitutes one more addition
to the over-all intellectual environment of the University of
Chicago. The proximity of the research center to the Univer-
sity campus will enhance the prestige and future growth of
departments of the University concerned with the problems
of legal research and related fields such as public welfare.

Set New Phys. Ed

Plans for Students

High school graduates entering the College with less than
two years of advanced standing are expected to meet minimum
qualifying standards in physical education. This is a change
from the former College program which required no standard

in physical education from
high school graduates.

Entering students will be
tested in swimming and water
safety, team sports, individual
and dual sports, and general phy-
sical ability. For those who pass
the minimum standard, all fur-
ther participation in the sports
program is purely voluntary.
Those who do not qualify in all
areas are expected to take in-
struction in deficient areas.

Qualification in the program is
not required for a degree. How-
ever, the dean and the registrar
expect the utmost co-operation in
the physical education program.

Law School Group

Examines Juries

A research group from the University of Chicago Law
School are applying research techniques of the behaviorial
sciences to problems of law in their current nation-wide study
of the jury system.

Under this project, financed by a Ford Foundation grant,
special -emphasis is being placed upon uncovering the cir-

cumstances which determine
the selection of particular jur-
ies, the nature and competence
of group deliberations, the effect
of the jurors’ economic, ethnic,
and religious background upon
his decisions, and the value of
particular rules of-jury delibera-
tions.

Since the jury room is not open
to direct observation, the opera-
tions of the jury are being recon-
structed indirectly. After cases
are classified according to various
criteria, the cases are studied
prior to trial and observed in the
courtroom by a lawyer and a
social psychologist.

At the close of the trials, jurors
are interviewed to determine their
capacity to follow and organize
evidence and their ability to un-
derstand and apply the judge’s
instructions; also noted are the
particular circumstances, inside
and outside the jury room, which
influenced their verdicts. Com-
parisons are also made between
the actual juries’ verdicts and
judges’ opinions about what the
verdicts should have been.

To relate the effects of various
social, ethnic, and religious back-
grounds to the decisions of indi-
vidual jurors, a group of juries
selected by law school workers
listen to tape recordings of select-
ed trials, and individual reactions
to the trial and subsequent jury
deliberations are then examined.

Jurors supply additional infor-
mation by filling out question-
naires in which they are asked
about their reactions to various
aspects to their trial, a great deal
of personal information, the ef-
fects of jury duty upon their jobs,
and their opinions on such topics
as capital punishment and circum-
stantial evidence.

enrollment Down
Again in Autuum

Although the University ex-
pects 150 more entrants this fall
than entered last year, total en-

rollment

again decline.

Registrar William E. Scott esti-
mated the decline would be about
two or three per cent.

There will be a "substantial in-
crease” of new college students
and enrollment in the divisions
will remain about the same as
last year. However, many stu-
dends graduated in the large
spring convocation, accounting
for the decline.

Yet the Fermis—in literary no-
toriety as well as scientific—re-
main unimpressed by fame.Some-
one told the UC scientist that he
was fortunate in being apotheo-
sized while he was still living.
After all, it was explained,
Madame Curie was dead before
her biography was written.

“You misunderstand,” Fermi
countered, “About me, Laura
cob Id never write and apotheosis
— she could only write a depot he-
osis.”

three articles, “The slavery of
the executive,” “Problems of the

his article on the executive Morse
Peckham shows how big business
has placed intellectual shackles
upon its leaders and expresses the
need for the recruitment of more
well-rounded and less specialized
leadership.

The Tribune Looks Us Over

UC has been the subject of two recent articles in the press. Con-
siderable conversation disputed whether Chester Manly’s appraisal
of UC in Sunday’s Tribune w’as favorable or not. No doubt existed
about the other article. Robert Vernon Abelson's “Conform or Else”
in the American Legion’s house-organ was a repeat of his year-old
denunciations of “communism” at UC.'

Time gave the University another “plug” with a story on the pro-

School Superintendent

Stresses

Parent-Educator Cooperation

Teachers and educational administrators cannot hold whole responsibility for the schools,
Benjamin C. Willis told a group of educational administrators in Judd hall.	’

Willis, general superintendent of Chicago schools, stressed the importance of using par-
ental and taxpayer criticism for constructive purposes.

“One of the barriers to effective parent-school cooperation has been the language used/’
Willis stated, noting that “reading readiness” and “core curriculum” are words peculiar to
educators.	'	——

The revenue producing val-
ue of education must be made as
clear to taxpayers as in the case
of roads and highways, Willis
stated.

Financial problems will only be
solved when problems of the in-
structional program and personal
relationships of administrators to
teachers and of educators to par-
ents have found a solution, he
said.

Administrators need to practice
group participation in supervision
of teachers, remembering that the
staff must feel a sense of prog-
ress, Willis advised. A good ad-
ministrator will be a good con-
ference leader, a good listener and
will give his teachers evidence of
approval, not Just disapproval, he

stated. “When successful he will
have a team with high -morale,
capable of meeting the increased
challenge.”

'Ain't' Ain't Bad,
Linguists Decide

Dictionaries should describe lan-
guage, not police it, Ignace J.
Gelb of the Oriental Institute as-
serted last Friday.

The statement came at a semi-
nar on the technical problems of
dictionary making. The seminar
was the first meeting of its kind.

One outcome of the meeting:
newer dictionaries will include the
word “ain’t” and other such words
in common usage. .

Speaking at the sixth interna-
tional cancer congress in San
Paulo, Brazil, last month, Profes-
sor Charles B. Huggins, director
of the Ben May cancer research
laboratories told how sex hor-
mones stripped of their sex char-
acteristics offer hope of produc-
ing drugs to cure breast and pros-
tate gland cancer.

These hormones neutralize reg*-
ular sex hormones which provide
the fuel for some cancers. Mere
traces of the hormones can ag-
grave cancer, he reported.

Even after sex glands had been
removed, some patients were still
receiving hormones from other
sources. Traces of the hormones
have been found in peanut but-
ter, soy beans and the water of
the Dead Sea.

Huggins told how one woman's
cancer shrank when she stopped
eating peanut butter.

Brownell Outlines
Education Problems
In Talk at Judd

School-dropouts, functional il-
literacy, shortage of teachers and
classrooms, and state laws which
make it difficult for local schools
to act, are the major problems in
American education, said Samuel
M. Brownell, U.S. commissioner
of education.

Brownell, speaking to a group
of educational administrators at
a conference on applying research
in education administration last
month in Judd hall, used a slide
demonstration to show the num-
ber of children schools can expect
to handle, and predicted shortage
of teachers and facilities unless
changes are made.

Losing Teachers

“We are losing qualified teach-
ers faster than we are replacing
them,” Brownell remarked. “If we
could get the teachers in our
school system to stay on a year
longer than they do now, we could
go a long way toward alleviating
our problems.”

He suggested that many teach-
ers leave for jobs with social se-
curity benefits. Social security for
teachers might encourage many
to slay in teaching, Brownell said.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

August 6, 1954

UC Faculty in Political Arena

Lecturer Lohman

Running for Sheriff

Senator Douglas

Seeks Re-election

“No picture of the Midway,” a UC pro-
fessor of economics once remarked, “is com-
plete without a snapshot of a social science
professor departing for Washington or else-
where with his little black bag.”

That economics professor was Paul Doug-
las, and for the past six years he and his little
black bag have been in Washington. Although
Senator Douglas is no longer a faculty mem-
ber officially, he is still regarded as “UC’s
senator.”

In 1939 Paul H. Douglas became “UC’s ai-
derman,” representing the fifth ward in the
Chicago city council. After three years of
bucking the Kelly-Nash machine on the coun-
cil floor and an unsuccessful attempt to de-
feat the machine candidate for the Democratic
nomination for the senate in 1942, he enlisted
in the marines.

Started as Private

He started as a private and
rose to the rank of lieutenant
colonel. Although he was 50 years
old he volunteered for active duty
and was wounded twice. Today
his left arm is useless as a result
of Japanese shrapnel wounds.

After the war, he returned to
the University and taught until
1948 when he got his chance to
run against Republican C. Way-
land Brooks for the senate seat.
He and Adlai Stevenson covered
the state together, billing them-
selves as “a gentleman and a
scholar.” Though he was expected
to lose, the tallies election night
gave him an almost 500.000 vote
majority over “Curly” Brooks.

( Number One Senator

As freshman senator from Illi-
nois, he rose rapidly in the legis-
lative leadership and in 1951 the
Political Science association voted
him “the number one senator in
the U. S.”

Douglas is presently running
for re-election against Republican
Joe Meek. As an economist he
has been worried about the busi-
ness recession and has urged
prompt action to restore full em-
ployment. His criticis have label-
ed him “a prophet of doom” for
this criticism of the economic
situation.

However, the senate responsi-
bilities have not completely sev-
ered Douglas’ academic connec-
tions. He has returned to UC on
many occasions since his election
in 1948 to deliver lectures and at-
tend conferences, the most not-
able occasions coming in 1951
when he delivered the Walgreen
lectures on “economy in the na-
tional government.”

UC to Lose
Church Hq.

UC apparently lost its chance
to house the national headquar-
ters of the National Council of
Churches of Christ when a coun-
cil committee chose an as yet un-
specified site in New York city
for the home.

Chancellor Kimpton offered
free land for the site last spring.
Northwestern university made a
similar offer. But John D. Rocke-
feller Jr. offered not only land,
but funds for the building in New
York.

The committee decision must be
ratified by the full council in the
fall, but it is doubtful if the com-
mittee judgment will be reversed.

Study Church Movement

‘Faith’: CEI

The Chicago Ecumenical Insti-
tute is currently being held on six
Chicago area campuses including
UC. The purpose of the institute
is to study the Christian faith

enical movement.

The faculty of the institute is
composed of delegates and con-
sultants to the World Council of
Churches. Four hundred minis-
ters and qualified lay people will
participate in the Institute on the
UC campus.

The institute includes a series
of lectures open to the public
August 9-11 at 8 p.m. at the Dis-
ciples University Church. M. M.
Thomas of India will be speak-
ing on “Christianity, democracy
and the revolutions of our time.”

Church of South India, will giye
a public lecture at Mandel Hall
the evening of the 12th.

Needs': Eby

Kermit Eby, in a highly critical
lecture on the World Council of
Churches, condemned the grow-
ing emphasis on institutional or-
ganization in the churches. He
thought that more attention
should be paid to people's needs
than to doctrinal issues.

Eby, professor in the social sci-
ences and a minister in the
Church of the Brethren, also
criticized the selection of “con-
servative, middle-class” Evanston
for the site of the council meeting.
He said that “not even the odors
of Evanston are representative
of America.” He suggested the
stockyards might be a better
place.

Prisoners are Joe Lohman’s business.

This UC lecturer in sociology and law has,
at various times, decided to release them, at-
tempted to repatriate them, and now as Dem-
ocratic candidate for sheriff of Cook county
is running for the chance to capture them.

Joseph D. Lohman’s name first became
headline copy when Governor Stratton fired
him from his post as chairman of the Illinois
state board of pardons and paroles. Chicago
newspapers hinted a connection between the
firing and the impending request for a parole
for thrill-slayer Nathan Leopold.

Lohman, however, had never expressed an
opinion in the Leopold parole incident (pa-
role was later denied), but he was outspoken
in his criticism of the Illinois parole laws.
These, he said, severly hampered the effec-
tive work of the parole board

by giving judges and juries the
power to determine sentence,
rather than the parole board
which can observe the prisoner
more closely.

Goes to Korea

A year after he was fired, Loh-
man was in Korea as civilian
consultant to the UN command
repatriation group. The Stars and
Stripes called him “the quarter-
back of our team.”

Lohman described his work:
“We went to Korea not to
persuade the PWs to return, but
to give them an opportunity for
free decision.”

Under Constant Surveillance

Lohman said that men found it
impossible to decide freely under
the constant surveillance of the
guards and their fellow prisoners
who were assigned to watch each
other. He cited the rase of Cpl.
Dickenson who chose to return
as soon as he found some privacy
and time to think in the prison
camp hospital.

After returning from Korea
Lohman returned to Chicago and
began his campaign to become
sheriff of Cook county. Many of
his addresses during the spring
were concerned with the prob-
lems he faced in Korea. This led
one Democratic leader to observe
that Lohman was “running for
sheriff on an anti-communist
platform.”

Promises Law-Enforcement

_ In his campaign speeches Loh-
man has promised stern law-en-
forcement—something, it is often
said, is badly needed in Cook
county. Most Democrats believe
Lohman has the qualifications
for the job.

He is a member and director of
the American Prison association,
a former chairman and present
member of the national capital
planning commission serving un-
der appointments by both Presi-
dents Truman and Eisenhower.

Lovett Says:
I'm Not Red

Retired UC Professor Robert
Morse Lovett testified last week
that he was not a communist and
had never attended a communist
meeting.

Professor Emeritus Lovett, v/ho
retired from the English faculty
in 1938. testified at a hearing of
the subversive activities control
board investigating a government
petition that the National Council
of American Soviet Friendship,
Inc., be required to register as a
communist front group under pre-
visions of the internal security act
of 1950.

Lovett said he had a “strong
conviction” that the group was
not guided by the communist
party. He said he w*s not a them
ber of the council, but knew sever-
al of its officers.
