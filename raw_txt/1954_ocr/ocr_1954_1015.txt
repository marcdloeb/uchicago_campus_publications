Explosion Noisy,
Injures No One

A sealed, eight-inch glass tube
containing diborane, an air reac-
tive compound, exploded in the
moat in front of Jones laboratory
late Monday afternoon, after be-
ing thrown from a second floor
window.

Several student research assist-
ants, working on a problem in in-
organic chemistry, were present
at the time of the explosion. No
one was injured.

According to the source inter-
viewed, it is customary to dispose
of the left over diborane in the
moat. The moat is floored with
gravel. The tube usually breaks
immediately, allowing the chemi-
cal to burn harmlessly before ex-
tinguishing itself.

On Monday the tube caught in
some vines which cushioned its
fall, causing it to land intact.

The resulting buildup of gases
due to an abnormally long period
of containment before exploding
caused the loud blast heard by
many students in the quad.

SRP-ISL Debate

Set for Wednesday

A debate about which political party represents UC students
will be held next Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. in Ida Noyes hall.
Clive Gray, president of SG and Al Forter, president of ISL
will defend the proposition, resolved: “ISL can best represent
UC students,’’ against Vera John and Marcus Raskin of SRP.

Paul Breslow, president of SRP, said, “SRP is presenting
a principled platform on the
issues of student needs, aca-
demic freedom, discrimination,
and student exchange. I hope
that all students who support our
program will work for its fulfill-
ment rather than merely give lip-
service to liberal principles for
partisan advantage; a campaign

should be based upon issues rath-
er than smear.”

Gray stated, “We have debated
the SRP people before, and I have
yet to find anyone who heard
those debates and thought the
SRP side was anything but hot
air. We have not only the argu-
ments but also the record in

Student Government, and I only
wish we had more opportunity to
present it to the campus.”

The debate, a prelude to the SG
elections on Thursday and Friday,
is sponsored by the Student
Forum under the direction of
Marvin Phillips.

Fermi in Hospital f or Surgery

Dr. Enrico Fermi, Charles H. Swift distinguished service professor
in the department of physics and the institute for nuclear studies,
underwent an exploratory operation last Saturday at Billings hospital.

Attendants at the hospital described his condition as satisfactory,
but declined to reveal what type or surgery he underwent or the
extent of his illness.

Name Grodzins

Adviser to LAK

Morton Grodzins has been

appointed adviser to the chan-
cellor on special projects, Chan-
hancellor Lawrence A. Kimp-
ton announced today. Because
of the responsibilities of this
new position, Grodzins is re-
linquishing his present position
as dean of the division of the
social sciences, and Chauncy D.
Harris, professor of geopraphy,
will serve as acting dean.

SG Stops Move to Alter

Dr. Fermi’s offices in the research institute also did not disclose
the reason for his surgery but said that he would be released from
Billings at the end of next week and that he would need a “great deal
of rest” and would be absent from his work for “some time.”

Candidate Petition Date

A move to extend the final deadline on petitions for places
on the ballot at the forthcoming Student Government election
vis defeated at SG’s first meeting of the year Tuesday eve-
ning. The vote of 12-8 with two abstentions was along party
lines, Independent Students league opposing and Students
Representative party supporting the move.

1 he I inal motion, as amend- j^l countered with charges that
ed by Donald Anderson (SRP- this was merely a device to give
son. sci.) would have extended SRP more time to find additional
the final deadline for unindorsed candidates. Emil Johnson (ISL-
candidates until such time as col.) claimed that SRP meant to

Fermi, a mild-mannered refugee from Fascism in his native Italy,
was a key figure in the development of the atomic bomb. He had
the chief role in building the uranium pile, or reactor, in the stands
of Stagg field in 1942, opening the atomic age.

University of Chicago, October 15, 1954

“sufficient publicity” had been
given.	• -

Tuesday was the final deadline
but SRP found itself unable to
contest seven seats at that time.
ISL also lacks one candidate.

Cite Lack of Publicity

SRP leaders complained that
there had been insufficient pub-
licity previous to the deadline.
Larry Lichtenstein (SRP-col.)
asserted that the only substantial
publicity given as to the availa-
bility of petitions or existence of
deadline appeared in a four-
paragraph story in last Friday’s
MAROON.

This gave prospective candi-
dates only three working days in
which to get petitions, procure the
necessary 25 signatures, and re-
turn the petitions to the SG office.
Lichtenstein claimed that this
militated against independents
who wanted to run for SG.

Water Floods Midway in

Downpour

Streets Become Rivers; Buildings Leak

During the recent rains, water
covered the Midway from bank to
bank and flowed in streams down
street approaches in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the Quadrangles.
The accumulation of five days’
rain not only flooded basements
in University buildings, but also
produced such sights as barefoot
students walking onto puddle-
spattered classroom floors in
Cobb.

Sheets of water up to 1% inches
deep invaded the below-ground-
level floors of about a dozen build-
ings on campus. The Buildings
and Grounds department also re-
ported approximately ten roof
leaks, although there was no dam-
age beyond stained walls and
ceilings.

Student reaction, according to
a Maroon survey, ranged frbm ex-
hilaration to depression. Several
students did not mind the water
uself, but complained that their
shoes had been completely ruined.

Several sidewalks in the area
were flooded within a few inches
of the edge because of the plugged
up sewers. On University avenue,
cars parked along sidewalks pre-
vented effective leaf clearance by
the Bureau of Sewers.

run their candidates under an in-
dependent label for purposes of
the election.

SRP agreed to the Tuesday
deadline at its passage last spring
and only wanted to change the

date because they were short on
candidates, charged Roger Wood-
worth, ex-president of SG and ISL
“elder statesman.” “If SRP or
any independents were interested
enough,” he said, “they could
have gotten the petitions and got-
ten them signed. . . . The C-Shop
is just running over with people
who are willing to sign Student
Government petitions.”

SRP is short two candidates in
social services administration,
three in medicine, one in the busi-
ness school, and one in the federa-
tion of theological schools. ISL
lacks a contestant for one seat in
the school of medicine.

Three freshmen inspect results of rainstorm. Occupants of Mid-
way puddle are, from left to right, Ina Davis, Debby Mines, and

Prefabs Will be Razed;

Remaining Tenants Organize

As of June 1955 the University’s pre-fab units will be torn down, displacing some 1,000
persons from 380 families.

Currently, the pre-fab council is attempting to reorganize in order to insure that it will
remain a group after the pre-fabs come down. It would like to form an organization for all
married students interested in providing better housing and solving other problems facing

them.

The council was originally
formed in the summer of 1953
to provide an organ through
which pre-fab tenants and tenants
of other University housing could

discuss their problems with

the

administration.

In the past, it has been success-
ful in getting floodlights, having
the University remove unused ice
; boxes from the pre-fab units, and
. in increasing the number of
■ armed guards stationed in the
area. The guards were requested
after a number of disturbances
were reported.

As of now the University has no
stated plan for the relocation of
the pre-fab tenants, but they are
considering the problem. Robert
Strozier, dean of students, has
promised to give the council an

answer in January. “Meantime,
we’re worried,” stated Scot Mitch-
ell, vice-president of the pre-fab
council. “The University should
give us a policy statement so we

Clubs Start

Fall Rushing

The official rushing period for
the women’s clubs on campus be-
gins Sunday at six. During the
first week each club will have one
party, scheduled as follows:

Monday—Mortar Board, Phi Gamma
Delta house, 7:30-9:30 p. m. ^

Tuesday—Quadranglers, Phi Upsilon
house, 7:30-9:30 p. m.

Wednesday—Sigma, Zeta Beta Tau
house, 7:30-9:30 p. m.

Sunday—Delta Sigma, Phi Gamma
Delta house, 2-4 p.m.

The clubs will have luncheon
dates in the coffee shop next
Tuesday and Wednesday and in
the Hunt room next to Hutchison
commons on Tuesday, October 26.

The girls will also have coffee
dates in the Hunt room next
Thursday.

The clubs are trying to contact
all eligible girls. However, any
girls who are sixteen or over and
are interested in joining a wom-
en’s club are invited.

can plan for the future.”

According to Mitchell, the pre-
fab tenants “like the University
and want to be a part of the Uni-
versity, or else they wouldn’t have
come here. The University now
has a responsibility to help us and
our families find a place to live.
We have to provide a healthy,
clean atmosphere for our kids.”

The income of pre-fab tenants
runs anywhere from nothing to
$6000 annually, with an average
of $2700. One-room units rent for
$48, while two-room units are $55
per month. A large proportion of

tenants are GI’s and many of
these have used up their GI Bill
credits.

Mitchell says he would like to
see “the University build one, per-
haps two or three low-cost apart-
ment buildings on the order of the
Olander Homes (Chicago Housing
authority homes at 39th near the
lake). This would house about
one-third of the families with
children who need a place to live.”
CHA rents range from $27 to $62
based on one-fifth of the family’s
income. Families must have an
annual income of $3700 or less to
qualify.

Student, University Jobs Handled
Through Employment Office

By Tajis Gardner

Students who want jobs, as well
as just anyone who wants to
work for the University are
served by the employment office
located on 58th and Ellis.

All non-academic jobs, ranging
from baby sitting to glass blow-
ing, are handled through this
office in Ingleside hall, under the
directorship of Fred Bjorling.

"The personnel office is stt up
basically to administer non-aca-
demic jobs at the Univesity of
Chicago, to integrate the busi-
ness of correcting jobs to stu-
dents and helping them to find
jobs off the campus,” Bjorling
stated.

In this capacity the office di-
vides jobs into full-time and
part-time, student and non-stu-
dent, on campus end off-campus
. classifications. The office has
evolved gradually into its pres-
ent position, and 13 persons are
now employed there. During the
past nine months : jproximately
1.500 persons have used the fa-
cilities of the office, and the
number is expected to be well
over 2,000 by the end of this
year, according to available
figures.

Originally the office main-
tained only a file of available
jobs, and students selected those
from the file which seemed most
promising. This system has been
replaced by an interview process,

which, according to the office, ik
more satisfactory in all respects.

The office can match skills and
jobs and have a better chance of
satisfying both students and em-
ployers. In this system, possible
employers can be checked before
students are sent cut.

Mrs. Patricia Metcalf, inter-
viewer in charge of student
placement, asserted that this
system satisfies everyone in-
volved, and that “most of our
employers are so loyal that it’s
wonderful.”

The one open file remaining
lists room and board openings—
those which give a student his
room in a private home in ex-
change for baby-sitting or other

services, and sometimes board in
exchange for housework.

Another file of job situations
is maintained— places where stu-
dents in the past have secured
off-campus jobs which have been
particularly interesting. These
places are recommended by Mrs.
Metcalf to students who might
be qualified.

All jobs, full-time, part-time,
campus and off-campus, are
listed and recommneded on a
non-discriminatory basis, accord-
ing to the office, in line with
general University principles.
Employers who desire to place
openings with qualifications oth-
er than necessary skills are not

Exchange Students Get Married,

Where Can They Live Now?

Two German exchange students, Wolf Heydebrand and Ruth Keiling, here under the aus-
pices of SG on the Frankfort Exchange program, have disrupted arrangements made by
both SG and the office of Dean Strozier by being quietly married in Rockford, Illinois, two
weeks ago.

The couple, fellow students in Frankfurt, were chosen out of a group of eight applicants
last March and arrived in this country on September 11. Plans had been made for Mrs. Hey-
debrand, formerly Miss Keiling, to live at International house -----------------------------

Harold Urey Airs Views

On Scientists, Secrets, Security

The adverse effects of public preoccupation with problems of security and espionage upon
the recruiting and training of competent scientists was emphasized in a speech made last Fri-

day by Harold C. Urey, Martin A. Ryerson distinguished service professor of chemistry and
a member of the Institute of Nuclear Studies.

Frey spoke at a dinner given in his honor by the Chicago chapter of the American Insti-
tute of Chemists who presented him with their 1954 testimonial award.

Speaking on “Scientists, secrets, and security,” Urey stated
that some degree of military strength is vital to American
security, but that the scientific knowledge necessary to ade-
quate military strength is being seriously curtailed by too
much public intereference into
porblems of security and espi-

onage among scientists.

Accusations Destructive

Such episodes as the cross-fire
of accusations surrounding Dr.
Eiiward Condon and Dr. Robert
Oppenheimer, and the publication
of a book attacking large numbers
of scientists who have worked on
the hydrogen bomb, have created
a tension in the field of science
which is discouraging to people
starting the long road to a scien-
tific career.

“The entire field of secrecy,
either of scientific or non-scien-
tific matters, should not concern
the average American more than
about one per cent of the time
that he gives to his responsibili-
ties as a citizen,” said Urey.

Instead, he suggested, the Amer-

The finest bar of its
class in the world

ican people should turn their at-
tention to the far greater problem
of improving primary and second-
ary schools from the standpoint
of producing technical people, and
of attracting a sufficient number
of people who have natural ability
in the exact sciences into college.

“We face in this country a near-
crisis in training scientists and
engineers,” he stated.

Public Contented

A pre-requisite of any national
security, Urey emphasized, is “an
internal feeling of well-being of
the body politic,” and the absence
both of violent religious, political,
and economic factionalism and of
any feeling that great injustice
exists for a substantial fraction of
the population.

Such a condition of stability ex-

and Wolf to live at one of the f
ter. Since their marriage, the
couple have been living in an
apartment on Kenwood avenue,
but moved early this week to an
address on Dorchester avenue, be-

ists in the United States at pres-
ent, he asserted, and internal
security against Communist phil-
osophy is being strengthened by
the vanishing of the small frac-
tion of the populus to which Com-
munist philosophy appeals—those
without satisfactory jobs, social
position or opportunities.

Commenting on American se-
curity in relation to the current
international political scene. Urey
felt that “most of our interna-
tional problems could be handled
more effectively if the western
democracies created a limited su-
per-government of limited powers
of a federal type.” He suggested
an organization based on the At-
lantic union idea.

Kimpton to Meet
Students at Teas

Educational interest teas have
been scheduled by Student Gov-
ernment through Wednesday in
Swift commons. The teas, at
which Mrs. Kimpton will be pres-
ent. are designed to give under-
graduates an opportunity to meet
the quadrangle faculty.

Yesterday the first tea of the
series was held, with members of
the physical sciences division pres-
ent. Today’s tea will have present
the law faculty; Monday the hu-
manities and Tuesday the social
science instructors will be on hand
to meet students.

changing each quar-

cause the former place was, “too
dirty.”

Under the conditions of their
G-l visas, both are allowed twenty
hours per week of part time work.

UC Pranksters
Pilfer (?)
Periscope

The periscope has been
stolen from thb submarine
now lodged behind the Mu-
seum of Science and Industry.
Well, maybe not a real periscope,
but a very good wooden model
made for the museum by the US
Navy at Portsmouth.

Museum officials say the object,
about five feet long and eight
inches in diameter, disappeared a
week ago Friday. They added
that it was dark out at the time
and mentioned that they saw some
fellows around previous to the
periscope’s vanishing act.

Harvey B. Lemon, a former pro-
fessor of physics at UC who is
now an adviser at the museum,
called Robert Strozier Monday on
the matter. The museum had re-
ceived an anonymous telephone
call which tipped them off that
the stolen periscope could be
found at a fraternity house on the
UC campus.

Strozier then called William Bir-
enbaum, director of student activ-
ities. Birenbaum contacted George
Stone, who is president of the
interfraternity council. Stone
checked all the fraternities. The
report ... no periscope.

The police are baffled. The
Washington park district station
didn’t know the periscope had
been stolen. While a squad car
was cruising down 57th street
Tuesday night a call was relayed
to it. It purportedly originated
from the Phi Kappa Psi frater-
nity. The tip named men of the
Phi Sigma Delta fraternity guilty,
so the patrolmen proceeded to
their house on the double. When
they arrived the Phi Sigs were
engaged in divisional rushing. A
thorough search of the house
yielded . . . nothing.

Wolf has three jobs and Ruth two
which help defray the expenses
of their small, third floor apart-
ment and meals.

A sum amounting to one hun-
dred and fifty-five dollars, origin-
ally earmarked for the cost of
Miss Keiling’s meals at Foster

hall, will be given to the couple
quarterly. They have no income
other than their combined earn-
ings and the SG fund.

Clive S. Gray, president of SG,
said in an interview that, “Its hap-
pened (referring to the marriage)
and we wish them all possible suc-
cess. However, it is our experience
that the best results, both for the
foreign and American students
are obtained when the foreign stu-
dent lives in student accommoda-
tions. However, in this case, we
are very fond of the Heydebrands
and will do everything possible
to help them.”

George Stone, president of the
inter-fraternity council, said that
a plan was before the council to
offer meals to the Heydebrands
at one of the houses, changing
weekly. “We were, of course, look-
ing forward to having Wolf at the
houses, but will do everything in
our power to help these people.”

Dean Strozier said that “the
change in status will not affect
the tuition and scholarships given
under the exchange program. We
were slightly disappointed (at the
marriage) in that the idea of the
program is to acquaint the for-
eign students with American con-
ditions which could best be done
through the fraternities and the
facilities of International house.
There has been no comment from
the German end of the program
as yet.”

Chess Battlers
Meet in Tourney

Chess enthusiasts will have a
chance this month to show their
mettle, since the chess club has
begun a University-wide tourna-
ment. Any student or faculty
member is eligible to compete.

Games may be played either
upon special arrangement or at
the regular club meetings Tues-
day nights at 8, in the Judson
lounge. The tournament is being
arranged so that players will
usually meet opponents of their
own strength.

Voting Advice

Will Be Available

Each year the Student Government ballot boxes on campus
are surrounded by party member who supply pencils, party
platforms, and free advice on exactly which square to mark.
Since no voting booths are provided, this practice often
•reaches distressing proportions, with candidates watching to
see just who the voter picks.

The blame for this cannot be placed entirely on those cam-
paigning since as long as some candidates engage in last min-
ute electioneering, those who refrain from such actions art
bound to lose votes.

It therefore seems the task of Student Government, which
passes the laws pertaining to election procedure, to prevent
this practice.

The present election law is less than effective. It provides
that there shall be no campaign literature distributed or dis-
played or any electioneering carried on within ten feet of any
ballot box, “wherever practicable.” The “wherever practic-
able” clause, in itself makes the law meaningless. Also no pen-
alty is provided for candidates who break this law. Its enforce-
ment, moreover, is put in the hands of the election and rules
committee of SG—many of whose members are candidates.

Since crowds around the ballot boxes are large, often it is
necessary to remove the ballot at least 20 feet and in many
cases further from the ballot box in order to mark it. Ten feet
is thus a very unrealistic distance. At this distance, a prac-
ticed candidate can easily see how the student casts his ballot.

It is important for the future of SG that the following points
be provided in a new and better law:

1) No literature should be posted in such a way that it can
be read from the polling area.

2 A table near the polling box should be provided at which
ballots must be marked, and at which no electioneering is
allowed.	,

3)	No candidate should be allowed to watch any voter mark
bis ballot.

4)	Violators should be subject to a penalty, such as dis-
qualification, strong enough to insure compliance.

5)	A procedure should be provided by which non-candidates
may initiate action against candidates who break the law.

6)	A tribunal should be provided to decide such cases of
infraction composed of non-candidates, such as the student-
faculty-administration court.

Until such action is forthcoming, the major political groups
will continue to electioneer near the polls, and frustrated vot-
ers will struggle in vain to keep their ballots secret.

"Take Trouble to Vote''

Asks Gray, SG Prexy

“Student Government lias come a long way toward serving
the student body in the last year,” Clive Gray, president of
SG, said this week in commenting on the forthcoming elec-
tions. “I hope that people will show their appreciation of
this effort by at least taking the trouble to vote.”

According to SG voting regulations, a vote may be cast by
appropriately marking an in-

dividual’s name, or simply
turning in a ballot unmarked
or with less than the maximum
number of candidates marked.
The effect of the latter vote is
an abstention which makes it
ignore difficult for any candidate
to obtain a majority in the bal-
loting.

There will be one more seat
available in SG this year. Com-
puted on the basis of enrollment,

Grey challenged

Editor, The Maroon

Clive Gray’s report on the NS A
conference in last week's Maroon
clearly shows that he stands
against student exchange with the
Soviet Union. This means that he
is opposed to US students partici-
pating in one of the most practical
and important programs for the
easing of the tensions of the Cold
War. Gray’s action at the NS A
Congress, where ho was one of the
most important leaders against
student exchange with the Soviet
Union (as reported in the Chicago
Tribune> points out that lie is not
limiting himself to a passive role.
This active opposition to exchange
directly contradicts both the ISL
and SRP platforms in the NS A
election and the pre-Congress posi-
tion of the entire_U. of C. NS a
delegation (See Maroon Aug. 6).

Gray tries to justify his person
al opposition to student exchange
with the Soviet Union by arguing
that exchange and discussion be-
tweet Soviet and US students can
not bring about any understand-
ing or communication. Titis is just
a student version of the old can*
ard pushed by the generals that
war is inevitable and therefore
negotiations and understanding is
impossible. Perhaps Gray's label
of the ‘‘intransigent Soviet men
tality” might more aptly be ap-
plied to himself and the likes of
him. For it is they who refuse to
admit that there are new possibil-
ities for peace, and that there have
been successful negotiations re-
cently.

During the summer there were
two more delegations of US stu-
dents touring the Soviet Union.
There was a magnificent ex-
change of ministers at the World
Council of Church meeting in
Evanston. According to Mr. Gray’
the clergyman from Czechoslo-
vakia should not have been able
to understand the viewpoint of the
clergymen from Chicago. Yet
these ministers were able to un
derstand one another, and jointly
came out for co-existence of dif-
ferent political systems. They also
called for a ban on the H-bomb
By this very meeting and ex-
change of opinions, t he clergymen

No More

Scratched ID

seats, and the law and medical
schools are both up one. On the
other hand, physical sciences, bi-
ological sciences, and business are
each down one seat.

The following number of mem-
bers will be elected from each sec-
tion of the university: college. 13;
social sciences, 10; physical sci-
ences, 4; humanities, 4; medical,
3; law, 3; FTS, 3; biological sci-
ences, 2; SSA, 2; business, 1;
Grad. Library, 1.

Students voting in Student Gov-
ernment elections will no longer
have the validations on their ID
cards scratched. A new system,
notching the cards on their sides,
has been deviseri.

Students must present their ID
cards at balloting tables in order
to vote. The cards are marked to
prevent plural voting.

Previous methods involved
scratching the validation. Deep
scratching, however, damaged the
cards; and people unacquainted
with the University, such as draft
boards and discount services,
thought the validation was can-
celled by the'marks.

The new method devised by Wil-
liam Seltzer, working in coopera-
tion with Albert C. Cotton,'bursar
of the University, will not dam
age the card.

gave lie to the State Department
and Mr. Gray’s position that ne-
gotiations and understanding be-
tween East and West are impos-
sible.

In a similar way, a reciprocal
student exchange with the Soviet
Union can also go a long way in
breaking down the harriers of the
cold war. We are confident that
the students at the U. of Chicago
would be interested in a visit of
Soviet students here.

in particular, the paragraphs in
which he ascribes to the 70(1 dele-

speaks of the need for the NSA

none of the many foreign students

tendency of the functionaries of
any democratic organization to
look upon that organization as an
end in itself, rather than as a me-

the NSA staff apparently felt that
the NSA's “respectability” might
be endangered if it took stands

SG Arm of Dean

As an old student who has seen
quite a few efforts put forth by
the politically active members of
the student body, I must con
gratulate the Student Govern-
ment in its latest super-colossal
service mart in a wire cage. The
service is a proper diversion for
those who might otherwise be in-
clined to represent the students
by whom they were elected.

It has too often proven em-
barrassing to the administration
of our university for those in re-
spectable SG positions to clamor
for student rights, the college
plan, academic freedom, and other
minor issues. The wire cage Is ap-
propriately confining for such
people.

We are proud of an SG which
has recognized its value as an ex-
tension of the Dean of Students
office and especially happy that
it squashed the radical efforts of
those who would have had a b*rok
co op instead.

UC was proposed at Tuesday
night’s Student Government
metting by Ralph Fertig, chair-
man of the University neighbor-
hood committee.

The plan of the institute, as
described in Fertig’s bill, is “to
offer (in symposium form) cours-
es of instruction and approaches
for integration of public, private,
volunteer and corporate groups’
interest in human relations, com-
munity conservation, renewal or
redevelopment, and public policy.”

A motion empowering the com-
mission on the neighborhood to
“enter into discussions with ap-
propriate administration and fac-
ulty personnel” regarding the
proposal was passed unanimously
by the assembly.

Fertig reported that many peo-
ple in the various areas had re-
ceived no special training in their
jobs and none had the benefits of
an integrated approach.

He was of the opinion that such
an institute would be welcomed
by people in the field. “Bringing

charge of the course, added
that, “The total effect was a
great success.”

Instruction began on the
boat going over, which rounded
the coast of Ireland and landed at
Le Havre. Base of operations was
the Cite Universitaire, part of the
University of Paris. The students,
who stayed at the Belgian pavil-
ion, experienced something new
in co educational dormitories. The
girls especially had some trouble
adjusting to co-ed toilets and
showers. No untoward difficulties
were reported, though.

Speak French

Classes were held three hours a
day, five days a week, with lan-
guage I once a week. The course
was the same as taught here on
campus, but with an added em-
phasis on conversational French.

Besides heavy impromptu cov-
erage of Paris, the students took
several group tours. Reims. Tours,
Mont St. Michel, San Mialo, Ver-
sailles, Chartes, and Fontaine-
bleau were all visited. Good food
was plentiful, with prices about
the same as in the U. S., in spite
of the psychological effect of
spending francs at roughly the
rate of 350 for $1.

The comprehensive exam was
taken in Paris the last day of
August. Mr. Playe mentioned
that the students did very well.

classes were held twice a day.
Boys stayed in the smaller ad-
joining ski barn.

Social life wasn’t neglected. A
picnic at Maroon lake, a visit to
the ghost town of Ashcroft, and
a 40-minute trip from 7,900 feet
to 11,300 feet on a chair ski lift
provided breaks from the books.

There were no failures on the
comprehensive. It was given in
the new seminar building, and the
essay topic was the room in which
the test was taken.

SRP and ISL State Their Aims

ISL Concept of SG

by CLIVE GRAY, ISL member

Now in its fifth year as the majority party in Student Gov-
ernment, the Independent Students League approaches next
week’s election in the hope of receiving another opportunity
to serve the student body. Since its founding in 1948, ISL has
endeavored to learn from the campus what is expected of
Student Government, and in formulating its platforms it has

promised to serve the campus in
the most practical ways possible.
ISL realizes that Student Govern-
ment has yet a long way to go be-
fore the campus views it as a
completely responsible and repre-
sentative organ of student opinion
and student service. But this is
the ultimate objective of ISL’s
policy in Student Government,
and the ISL candidates in this
election promise to work toward
it by continuing and increasing
the conscientious services built
up by previous ISL Student Gov-
ernments.

The idea of Student Govern-
ment as an organ of student serv-
ice was also what motivated the
first ISL group to organize and
campaign in an SG election back
in 1948, just over a year since the
establishment of Student Govern-
ment at University. At that time
most of the representatives in SG
considered the body a forum for
debating virtually all major po-
litical issues upon which the pre-
vailing philosophy of students in
general and C students especially
took a “progressive” stand. The

SRP Platform

University of Chicago students face many real problems. Living and educa-
tional expenses are high, academic freedom is under attack, discrimination is
still with us, and we find barriers growing between ourselves and students in

many parts of the world.

In the belief that student action, well considered and vigorously Implemented,
can make effective and worthwhile contributions towards the lessening of these

problems,
program.

SRP suggests the following

WE NEED STUDENT GOV-

ERNMENT:

TO EASE STUDENTS’ ECONOMIC
BURDENS, SRP pledges to

1.	Initiate projects for student co-
operative housing, eating and book-
buying.

Such projects have In the past been
frustrated by administration opposi-
tion, but could be realized if an inde-
pendent source of funds were avail-
able.

SRP will work with the newly form-
ed NSA committee on co-operatives,
will initiate independent fund-rais-
ing projects and continue to work for
such measures as the quarterly fee,
which last year as a referendum re-
ceived the endorsement of a majority
of voters, although not the requisite
two-thirds. A fee of this type would
prove insignificant when compared
with the savings possible.

2.	Request that the administration
obtain housing as comparable low-
level rentals for the 350 families re-
siding in pre-fabs which are to be
torn down. We will urge conferences
between these students and the ad-
ministration so that residents will be
aware of university plans and the re-
moval to other quarters be smoothly
effected.

3	Work for the establishment of a
#1 hourly minimum wage for student
employees of the University.

TO DEFEND ACADEMIC FREEDOM

The University of Chicago has an out-
standing tradition of academic freedom.
We are proud that our University is one
of the few that did not dismiss pro-
fessors who refused to testify before
Investigating committees.

The political climate created by the
heresy hunt is a continuing threat to
the University and necessitates the ac-
tive defense of this tradition. In order
that SG may contribute to this effort:

1.	SRP will continue to act upon
the principle that academic compe-
tence is the only criterion for the em-
ployment of faculty.

2.	SRP will enforce strict observation
of the Student Bill of Rights to insure
that student organizations are recog-
nized regardless of their political
views and may hear speakers of their
choice.

3.	SRP will again support and will
work to encourage full campus par-
ticipation in Academic Freedom week.
To be successful the week’s activities
should engage the whole campus, the
various organizations as well as indi-
vidual students, in discussing the
problems of maintaining academic
freedom.

TO CO-OPERATE WITH FACULTY
AND ADMINISTRATION

SRP believes that the common inter-
ests of students, faculty and adminis-
tration could better be served by in-
creased co-operation, in both academic
and non-academic matters, where the
opinions of all are considered and the
rights of all maintained.

We suggest:

1.	An expanded student-faculty re-
lations committee, placed on a real-
istic basis and including more stu-
dents.

2.	A course evaluation program,
which would enable students from
each department to meet with fac-
ulty for critical discussion.

TO COMBAT DISCRIMINATION

SRP believes that all, regardless of
race, religion, or natural origin, deserve
equal opportunity for education. Edu-
cation limited by segregation and dis-
crimination for some means limited
education for all. As an influential
member of the community, the Univer-
•Ity should formulate and act upon a
policy of complete integration.

SRP in Student Government will:

1	Co-operate with NSA and other

records of the 1947-48 Student As-
sembly picture, among other
gems, a debate on the Communist
coup in Czechoslovakia and the
Smith Act trial of 11 Communist
leaders.

Oppose Authority

But the first ISL members saw
in this attitude an unreasonable
assumption by SG of authority
never granted it by the student
body, so they campaigned then,
as we are doing now, to make Stu-
dent Government first and fore-
most campus-oriented. ISL won
its first SG election in autumn
1948, and under the direction of
president Alex Pope, set about
creating responsible student self-
government where before there
had been little more than agita-
tion and debate over “principles.”
A permanent contribution of the
first ISL Student Government
was the Student Book Exchange,
located first in Ida Noyes Hall,
later in Cobb, and at present in
the Reynolds Club, where last
year’s SG combined it with sev-
eral other student services.

groups, such as NAACP, and with our
fellow students at other schools in
supporting implementation of the
Supreme Court decision on discrim-
ination in education.

2.	Propose that SG, in conjunction
with faculty and administration,
adopt the Fair Educational Practices
code proposed by the UC chapter of
NAACP, including the following:

a)	All entrance requirements or
quotas based on religion, race or na-
tional origin shall be abolished.

b)	All forms of discrimination in
housing, whether in dormitories or
officially approved residences shall
be abolished. Other housing which
gets preferential treatment, e.g.
listings or recommendations to stu-
dents, faculty or employees, shall be
limited to non-discriminatory hous-
ing units.

c)	All University Jobs shall be filled
on the basis of ability and need only.
Discriminatory employers shall not
be listed by the University’s employ-
ment office.

d)	University recognition shall be
granted only to those campus groups
that do not actually discriminate on
the basis of race, religion or national
origin. Any campus organization un-
able or unwilling to comply shall
lose Its campus recognition.

3.	Urge that such a code be adopted
by the state legislature, as a step in
the direction of racial equality in
American society, which alone can
make a truly meaningful equal edu-
cational opportunity for all.

TO ESTABLISH INTERNATIONAL
EXCHANGE

SRP feels that dement Attlee’s state-
ment. “Co-existence or co-extermlna-
tlon,” is a timely one. A relaxation of
present international tensions Is essen-
tial if there is to be a future in which
we can exercise our skills and practice
our professions. We feel that there are
concrete contributions which Student
Government can make in this direction.

International exchange of students is
the most effective means by which stu-
dents may help lessen international
tensions. SRP believes that:

1.	SG should work with NSA to ex-
pand student exchange programs with
all countries.

2.	Since the greatest danger to peace
comes from the tension existing be-
tween the United States and the So-
viet Union, there should be an effort
to institute a two-way exchange pro-
gram between these countries.

3.	In the event that governmental
restrictions makes the exchange of
students Impossible, communication
should be established through the ex-
change of exhibits and cultural mate-
rial between this University and oth-
ers abroad.

4.	In view of the fact that four
groups of American students have
toured the Soviet Union during the
past year, but Russian students wish-
ing to tour the United States have
thus far been refused visas, SG should
press for the granting of visas to stu-
dents from all countries.

TO OPPOSE MILITARIZATION

Universal military training Is based
upon the presupposition of inevitable
war. SRP believes that Student Govern-
ment should:

1.	Inform the campus In detail
about the new UMT proposals of the
Eisenhower administration, which
have the intended effect of “psycho-
logical conditioning.”

2.	Guarantee that there will be a
co-ordinated and effective expression
of student sentiment against these
proposals to Congress.

WHAT KIND OF STUDENT
GOVERNMENT?

Student Government has been more

See ‘SRP platform,’ page 11

During the first months of its
existence, Student Government
was a rather unsteady organiza-
tion in which the Administration
was reluctant to place any sig-
nificant trust or authority. So an-
other task which the first ISLers
saw very clearly was to persuade
the Administration that a continu-
ing and representative student or-
gan could be granted increasing
authority over student affairs.
ISL Student Governments in 1948,
1949, and 1950 negotiated with the
Dean of Students on this point,
with the result that a Statute of
Powers was finally granted Stu-
dent Government. The Statute
gave SG the authority to recog-
nize student organizations and en-
act regulations governing them,
subject to the approval of the Ad-
ministration. The most important
legislation passed by Student Gov-
ernment under this provision was
the Michigan Plan, regarding or-
ganizations with discriminatory
membership clauses in their con-
stitutions, which an ISL Student
Government enacted in 1951.

Pass on Code

In 1950 negotiations were com-
pleted for the establishment of
a Student-Faculty-Administration
Court, which was to have jurisdic-
tion in cases arising under the
Student Code, Regulations, Stat-
ute of Powers of Student Govern-
ment, and the SG Constitution.
The Court, which contains a stu-
dent majority, asserted its juris-
diction against the Administra-
tion in the MAROON case of late
1951. At that time the editor of
the MAROON was removed by
the Dean of Students in seeming
contravention of the Student
Code. The power of the Court re-
ceived a definite setback in the
case, but most of the parties in-
volved felt the prestige of the
Court and the weight of the en-
tire Student Government had

made quite a dent in the united
forces behind the Dean’s action.

A third major step forward in
student self-government was
taken by last year’s ISL Student
Government, which won Adminis-
tration approval for a plan where-
by student organizations partly
subsidized from the student activi-
ties fund will have a say in the
allocation of this fund. ISL’s goal
in this matter is to obtain com-
plete financial autonomy for the
student groups involved.

Reflect Concern

• Aside from its emphasis on the
development of student self-gov-
ernment, ISL has represented and
expressed unambiguous student
concern on the issue of academic
freedom. It helped found in 1949
the first All-Campus Civil Liber-
ties Committee, to which repre-
sentatives of all campus organ-
izations were invited to discuss
the issues raised by the Broyles
Bills, introduced into the Illinois
Legislature then and during the
following two legislative sessions.
Every other year the campus has
been aroused by the threat of
these Bills, which trespass on
all constitutional safeguards for
freedom of speech. And each time
a campus leader who belonged to
ISL has chaired the ACCLC, and
testified before a committee of
the State Legislature to bring re-
sponsible student opinion to bear
against the Broyles Bills.

The most evident of ISL’s ef-
forts in SG have been those de-
voted to creating services for the
student body in areas not dealt
with by the Administration. The
best-known examples of these are
the Student Book Exchange, Tick-
et Agency, Mimeograph Service,
and Loan Service, all of which
operated separately for periods of
a month to six years, until they
were centralized last April in the
Reynolds Club.

ISL Platform

The Independent Students League (ISL) was founded in 1948 by a group of
students who believed that responsible self-government In extra-curricular affairs
is a vital part of the educational process. Since then, ISL has worked through
Student Government to implement student opinion on matters directly affecting
the student body, and to establish programs for serving the material needs of
students.

ISL believes that Student Government
should concentrate Its efforts in areas
which pertain to students as stu-
dents. and particularly to the prob-
lems of our campus. At the same time
we recognize our responsibility to con-
sider off-campus questions of direct
interest to students and to the Univer-
sity community, such as Fair Educa-
tional Practices legislation, academic
freedom, federal aid to education, and
the University neighborhood. However,
ISL beliefs that Student Government
should not pretend to speak for our
diversified student body on general
problems of national and International
politics.

ISL’s most positive emphasis In SG
has been In the field of student services,
where we have organized programs to
save students money and to serve im-
portant student needs. This platform
outlines the work of 1953-54*8 ISL Stu-
dent Government, and presents the pro-
gram we will follow In the new 1954-55
Student Government.

STUDENT SERVICE CENTER. A major
achievement of the present ISL-led Stu-
dent Government was the creation of
the Student Service Center. The Student
Book Exchange, Ticket Agency, Mimeo-
graph Service, and Railroad Discount
Service were centralized in one location,
and are now operated several hours daily
by a permanent staff. In addition, a
Student Loan Service was installed for
the first time.

ISL will expand these services by:

1)	Widening the new policy of order-
ing second-hand book consignments
from downtown dealers;

2)	Expanding the coverage of the
Ticket Agency, extended this past year
to the Lyric Theater Guild and the Shu-
bert Theaters;

3)	Increasing the Loan Service funds
by SG approbation; and

4)	Publicizing and extending further
the vacation-trip Railroad Discount
Service.

ISL will also provide these new serv-
ices:

1)	The reactivated SG non-discrimina-
tory housing-file, repealed by an SRP-
dominated Assembly in 1952-53;

2)	A Student Publicity Service, where
students can have posters made at cost
and placed promptly on bulletin boards;

3)	An Indexed file of second-hand
goods for sale to students:

4)	A register through which commut-
ing students desiring rides or riders
could be brought together;

5)	A register listing tutorial services
available to students desiring special
help in courses; and

6)	A file of summer job opportunities.
REDUCING STUDENT COSTS. ISL will
develop programs to reduce student
costs in three basic areas:

1)	CHEAPER HOUSING—Last year’s
ISL-SG won the support of a committee
of UC Trustees for the idea of a student
housing co-operative. The next ISL
Student Government will search for a
house for sale or rent near the campus
in which conversion to a co-op would
be possible under zoning and building
laws. We will also seek financial support
for the project in the form of a Univer-
sity loan

2)	CHEAPER EATING—A new ISL-SG

3)	CHEAPER BOOKS—Inasmuch as
University Bookstore prices are exces-
sively high for both texts and syllabi.
ISL will press for an agreement whereby
the Student Service Center can sell
certain new texts at prices near cost.

In addition, an ISL Student Govern-
ment will negotiate with the Adminis-
tration to press for special student
housing arrangements in the neighbor-
hood for students displaced by the
demolition of University pre-fabs. SG
will suggest that University-owned
buildings now operated commercially
for profit be devoted to occupancy by
students.

TUITION. We believe that the basic
problem of student costs is high tuition,
and we propose two specific approaches
to the solution of this problem:

1)	The tuition increase In 1952 result-
ed In reduced tuition revenue because
of the large decline in enrollment, as
SG predicted at that time. We, there-
fore, propose that the University under-
take a substantial and well-publicized
tuition reduction with a view to increas-
ing revenue by attracting more students.

2)	Chancellor Kimpton should take
the lead in organizing university edu-
cators in support of a federal scholar-
ship program on these lines:

a.	Scholarships would be awarded to
students in all fields of knowledge, on
the basis of national competitive exam-
inations;

b.	The recipients of the scholarships
would be free to attend any accredited
institution;

c.	The program would be administered
by professional educators, thus avoiding
federal regulation of education.

CIVIL LIBERTIES. ISL vigorously sup-
ports equality of opportunity for all
students without regard to race, color,
religion, or creed. Through Student
Government, ISL has worked to elimi-
nate discrimination on campus and in
the University community.

Michigan Plan

SG’s most difficult problem last year
involved the “Michigan Plan,” enacted
by SG In 1951. which provided that after
1953 no student organization could re-
main on campus whose constitution
required It, even If unwillingly, to dis-
criminate on the basis of race or
religion. Last year only one campus
group, a fraternity, still had such a con-
stitution. In the face of loud demands
by the minority party that the fraternity
should be expelled at once, ISL decided
that the deadline should be extended
until after the national fraternity con-
vention In September. Thus the local
chapter would have a chance to achieve
final elimination of the discriminatory
clause from Its constitution. Last
month the fraternity successfully elimi-
nated the clause, and ISL believes that
this Important blow against discrimina-
tion fully Justifies our decision to allow
the fraternity Jo remain on campus a
few months longer.

Non-Dis( riminatory Housing File

During the coming year, an ISL Stu-
dent Government will revive the SG
non-discriminatory housing file. Estab-

lished In 1952 when the Administration
refused to eliminate discriminatory list-
ings from Its own file, the SG housing
file could work, and that students were
sufficiently interested in the problem to
see that it did. Unfortunately, the file
was abolished in 1952-53 when SRP con-
trolled Student Government. Their
alternative—to present petitions to the
Administration demanding that it mend
its ways—brought no action at all. Now
the Student Service Center, with its
regular hours, will be an ideal location
for the revived housing file.

Fair Educational Practices

ISL will cooperate wtih various groups
on campus to work out a Fair Educa-
tional Practices Code for the University
of Chicago. In addition it will contact
this area’s state senators and repre-
sentatives to enlist their support for
Fair Educational Practices legislation in
the State Legislature.

ACADEMIC FREEDOM. ISL believes that
the right of teachers to teach and stu-
dents to learn should be determined
solely by academic competence. As a
means of implementing the general stu-
dent agreement on this proposition, ISL
will reactivate the All-Campus Civil
Liberties Committee, formed of repre-
sentatives from all campus groups dur-
ing the State Legislature sessions of
1949, 1951, and 1953 to combat the Broyles
Bills and other proposed legislation
tending to restrict free speech. ISL will
also sponsor activities in connection
with the NSA endorsed Academic Free-
dom Week In April.

NATIONAL STUDENT ASSOCIATION.
ISL members have been active in the
National Student Association since its
founding here In 1946, and an ISL mem-
ber is now chairman of NSA’s National
Executive Committee. An ISL Student
Government will continue to cooperate
fully with NSA, particularly in these
aspects:

1)	Information about NSA low-cost
summer tours of Europe will be made
available in the Student Service Center
and arrangements for 1955 tours may be
made there;

2)	The NSA student discount system
will be expanded to more neighborhood
stores; and

3)	Student Government will carry on
its contacts with foreign student associ-
ations through NSA.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE. The SG Frank-
furt exchange program, one of the first
student-managed programs in the na-
tion, was founded by an ISL SG in 1951
Through the program, two UC students
go to Frankfurt and two Frankfurt stu-
dents come to Chicago each year. The
financial basis of the program consists
in support from the two universities, as
well as (on the UC side) the fraternity
system, University Theater, and Student
Government itself. ISL will make ef-
forts to make the necessary financial
arrangements for extending the program
to another country, probably India.

INCREASING STUDENT SELF GOV-
ERNMENT. Last year’s ISL Student
Government negotiated with the Uni-
versity Administration in the question
of allocating student activities funds,
and won the Administration’s approval
for a plan whereby representatives

SRP History Told

by Patil Breslow, president of SRP

On October 17, (1942j)fhe Maroon reported the formation
of a new campus political party, the Student Representative
Party (SRP), arising from the amalgamation of three liberal
student groups.

SRP’s first platform sharply criticized the previous (ISL)
Student Government for its retreat on discriminatory housing;

its dangerous Maroon “Advisory
Board,” which smacked of possi-
ble censorship of the campus
press; failure to act on co-
operative solutions to the students
economic problems and continual
depreciation of the need for cam-
pus participation in SG policy-
making and activity.

The SRP platform declared,
"SRP asserts that there exists
among a substantial group of stu-
dents the feeling that SG has
ceased to play an important role
in student affairs.”

SRP felt that ISL had failed to
act in defense of civil liberties and
said, “We maintain and shall act
upon the principle that not only
academic freedom but full civil
liberties for all people regardless
of belief is a worthy student ob-
jective.”

ISL Refuses Co-operation

The newly formed SRP won a
majority of seats in the SG of
1952-53, although it received less
than 40 per cent of the vote. (A
third party, the Independent
Coalition, had run a campaign de-
voted largely to accusations of
pro-Communism against both ISL
and SRP. Now that IC is no long-
er with us, such tactics have been
adopted by ISL campaigners.)

The ISL refused to co-operate
in assuming any responsibility
whatsoever in the’ new SG. SRP
has repeatedly affirmed its will-

right: Jan Metros, Jim Handler, Monica Kozasa, Clive Gray.

ingness to co-operate with any
groups in carrying out its pro-
gram.

Despite the obstacles of the lack
of support from a majority of the
campus and ISL unco-operative-
ness, the SRP-SG made an im-
pressive record.

Support Free Press

Among other things SG under
SRP repealed the Maroon Ad-
visory Board and supported the
principle of a free student press;
established the Commission on
the University Neighborhood;
conducted a petition campaign in
support of a non-discriminatory
housing file; made the first por-
posals and began work on co-
operative eating, housing and
book-buying services; re-estab-
lished the All Campus Civil Liber-
ties Committee; organized an
active defense against the Jenner
committee’s visiting inquisition;
held the first Academic Freedom
Week on campus, which featured
Senator Wayne Morse as princi-
pal speaker; worked to expand
the SG exchange program to
bring in countries other than Ger-
many, including those under Com-
munist control; established a
democratic replacement policy for
SG and played a leading role in
the effort to save the Hutchins
College Plan from extermination.
SRP continued and expanded pre-

vious student needs programs of
value, while abandoning such
services as the hat and coat
checking stand and the proposed
lemonade stand, which seemed to
us to be of dubious value.

In the field of co-operative serv-
ices, SRP worked out detailed and
practical plans for a housing co-
op, which would have made good
housing available for about $5 a
week, a book-buying service to
obtain discounts on new textbooks
and a snack bar for hot sand-
wiches and coffee during the day
and evening in the Reynolds Club
basement. These plans were frus-
trated by administration unwill-
ingness to advance funds. SRP
believes that they are still feasible
and has proposed methods of rais-
ing funds independently of the
administration.

Increase Popularity

SRP increased its popular vote
considerably in the next two elec-
tions, for NSA delegates and SG,
although it did not win a majority
at either election.

As the minority party in the
Student Government of 1953-54,
SRP indicated its desire to co-
operate with the majority. Again
ISL insisted on all the say or none
at all.

SRP opposed such ISL moves as
amending the Michigan Plan
when it found the administration
unwilling to enforce the agree-
ment, the change in the nature of
the Student Government Commis-
sion so that it concerned itself
only with procedural problems
and its continual preoccupation
with trivial rules of procedure and
legal manipulation.

SRP feels that this past year’s
SG has been characterized by an
attitude of majority partisanship
for its own sake and a failure to
undertake positive action in the
areas of discrimination, civil lib-
erties and student exchange. Gen-
erally, ISL has acted only when
under strong pressure, has been
unenthusiastic about anything but
procedure. The wire cage in the
Reynolds Club basement, while
making used books available at
a slightly more convenient place
has been extolled by ISL beyond
all proportion to its actual value.

Handbook Partisan

Even the Student Handbook, a
traditional publication of SG, has
been used for political purposes
and personal publicity for the
President of SG. (One would think
that SG’s annual list of discount
stores would be non-partisan, but

that too includes a picture of Mr.
Gray, and a page of comments by
him.)

Instead of co-op housing ISL
proposed to rent two floors of a
nearby hotel. SRPers felt that this
was not of very great benefit to
students. The plan failed for lack
of potential residents.

While a minority SRP continued
its program on campus with a
number of meetings, lectures and
cultural activities and active par-
ticipation in Academic Freedom
Week.

In the NSA election of last
spring, SRP won a majority of
seats on the delegation and over
50 per cent of the total vote. Run-
ning on a detailed and practical
platform of “Four Freedoms for
the Student,” SRP won the sup-
port of many independents who
agreed with its platform. SRP
delegates worked at NSA to carry
out their program.

Forget Promises

The ISL delegation, after an
interesting display of doubletalk,
forgot their campaign statements
and voted against a resolution en-
dorsing exchange with Commu-
nist countries. ISLer Gray led
the fight against the exchange
proposal, while SRP-endorsed dele-
gation chairman Dick Ward and
all other SRP delegates supported
the resolution, as they had
pledged.

A concluding bit of very recent
history: At this week’s SG meet-
ing ISL Michigan Plan expert
Stein, in response to SRP ques-
tioning, stated that the discrimi-
natory fraternity on campus con-
tinues to have a discriminatory
clause, despite recent publicity to
the contrary, and will not stop
discriminating unless its next
convention, in two years, re-
passes the resolution repealing
the clause.

At the same meeting ISL lead-
ers seemed surprised when asked
by SRPers if they had pursued a
policy of accepting discriminatory
advertisements in their publica-
tions. (At least one such ad was
run.) They said that it had just
never occurred to them to pursue
a policy of requiring non-discrimi-
nation, that one just doesn’t ask
businessmen questions like that.

SRP has in the past, and con-
tinues, to believe that one of the
most important functions Student
Government can serve is to help
buildi a University community in
which discrimination is unknown.

Code Adopted Change Vote

An NAACP sponsored educa-
tional practices code has been in-
corporated into the platforms of
both SRP and ISL for the coming
campus elections.

The Fair Educational Practices
Code has been endorsed by both
major parties. The Code was for-
mulated by a committee of the
campus chapter of NAACP (Na-
tional Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People), a
non-partisan organization.

Included in the Code, which is
based on suggestions made at the
NSA convention, are articles
against racial, religious, or na-
tional discrimination in student
housing, employment, and en-
trance requirements. The exclu-
sion of photographs from en-
trance requirements is caused by
their use for discriminatory pur-
poses.

Other articles cover faculty hir-
ing, and campus organizations.

Students who do not have any
more standard college comprehen-
sives to take but are still classified
as “undergraduates,” will vote for
Student Government representa-
tives only in the divisions in which
they are taking most of their
courses. This is in accordance
with the election law as amend-
ed by SG’s summer executive
council last week.

Clive Gray, president of SG, de-
scribed the change as intended to
maintain the unity of the college
as that body of students regis-
tered in a unified general educa-
tion program.

The amended law also provides
for the election and rules commit-
tee of Student Government to sur-
vey the grade requirements of
candidates in the forthcoming SG
elections. This task was previous-
ly handled by the Administration.
Under the new procedure the com-
mittee will receive a list of the
letter grades received by each
candidate from the Administra-
tion. There will be no indication
as to what courses the grades cor-
respond to. The committee will
then determine the averages of
the grades in order to establish
whether or not a candidate meets
the minimum grade requirement
of a Straight “C.”

campus groups subsidized by the Uni-
versity will have a say in disbursing
these funds. A new Student Government
under ISL will again work to obtain for
itself and other student groups a greater
voice in the direction of student affairs
by taking over certain functions now
discharged by the Administration.

EDUCATIONAL POLICY. ISL will reac-
tivate the Educational Survey Commis-
sion of 1951-52’s SG to discuss recent
developments in University Educational
policy, particularly with regard to the
new joint degree programs. The Com-
mission will formulate conclusions, pub-
licize its findings and report them to
appropriate faculty committees. The
ESC will also tackle the question of ath-
letic scholarships, in an effort to un-
cover the University’s exact policy in
this matter.

NEIGHBORHOOD. ISL believes that
Student Government should cooperate
fully with the Southeast Chicago Com-
mission and other community groups
whose purpose is to halt blight and
decay in this area of the city. ISL will
alos expand the work of the Commission
on the University Neighborhood, with
special emphasis on research into the
situation of student off-campus housing.
ORIENTATION. Looking ahead to a
year from now, ISL will make plans to
maintain and expand the orientation
activities undertaken by SG this year.
For the first time, several events were
arranged for entering divisional students
by Student Government, including Chi-
cago bus-tours, tours of the campus,
and the very successful Divisional Night
which gave divisional students the op-
portunity to meet faculty and adminis-
tration representatives, as well as
numerous student organizations. SG
also co-sponsored Activities Night,
printed and distributed the Student
Handbook, and prepared a booklet list-
ing neighborhood Student Discount
stores for distribution at central regis-
tration.

Renaissance Exhibit

Varied, Didatic

Tending to be more of a didactic display than a representa-
tive exhibit of the usual sort, the collection currently showing
in the Renaissance society in Goodspeed galleries features a
variety of reproducing techniques.

However, with this purpose in mind, it is doubtful whether
an average viewer unfamiliar with the techniques could get a

very clear picture of the meth-
ods of production or the ex-
pressive possibilities of the
media. Although certain tech-
niques were illustrated in great
detail, such as lithograph and
color-woodcut, in others tech-
niques less familiar, notably seri-
graphing, the methods of produc-
tion were scantily illustrated.

Furthermore, although flexi-
bility in a technique is certainly
desirable, it becomes invalid when
it does what might have been
achieved better by another meth-
od, and becomes mimicry of an-
other medium. The exhibit con-
tains a number of woodcut-like
lithographs, silkscreen woodcuts,
and tapestry-like silkscreens.

Judged on their own merits, the
works vary in quality, but in gen-
eral show a preoccupation with
technique which does not always
make up for a lack in enthusiasm
and freshness of subject matter.

Students presenting their ID cords

Nordine Chills and Delights Audience

A hardy band of 400 people endured seven inches of rain last Saturday evening to see Ken Nordine, the well known tele-
vision personality, give his program of readings at Mandel hall.

In this, the first of a series of readings to be sponsored by University Theatre, Nordine alternately chilled and delighted
his audience with Poe’s “The Tell Tale Heart" and several witty monologues. These last, known as “word jazz,” were accom-
panied on the piano by Dick Marx, and consisted of mildly ribald episodes more suggestive of the night club entertainer than

the literary reader.

Dick Marx also appeared in
a solo capacity with several
presumably “cool” numbers
and a well earned plug from Nor-
dine for a north side night club at
which ne is appearing.

In addition Nordine read sev-
eral poems by T. S. Eliot, includ-
ing “The Love Song of J. Al-

Ken Nordine . .

. . . interprets “The Love Song
of J. Alfred Prufrock for cap-
tivated audience at Mandel Hall
last Saturday evening.

The main exception was a color
lithograph by Roozendaal entitled
‘’Dogs," a simple and forceful
composition which seemed, how-
ever. to be more adapted to a
woodcut.

Also of especial interest were
“Roman Urchins,” an expressive
although somewhat studied work
by Federico Castellon, and “Negro
Girl,” by Doebele.

All works in the exhibit, spon-
sored by the International
Graphic Art society, are on sale,
and may be viewed Monday
through Friday from 9 a. m. to
5 p. m. and Saturday from 1 to
5 p. m. F. G. Ternenyi

fred Prufrock," and “The Ballad
of the Long Legged Bait," by
Dylan Thomas. Although famil-
iar with the splendid readings
given these poems by their au-
thors, the reviewer was im-
pressed by Nordine’s completely
different but altogether satis-
factory treatment of them. He
brought countless unsuspected
meanings to light, which is ex-
actly what a good reader should
do.

Toward the end of the program
he read the monologue of a spite-
ful man by Dostoevsky and herein
demonstrated his best talent —
humor.

The defects of the program
were largely mechanical. The

lighting technicians weje in a re-
markably playful mood, and their
endless changing of the size and
color of the spotlights achieved
little consistency with the mood
Nordine was trying to create.
After a number of rapid-fire shifts
through the spectrum during a
Marx solo, they hit upon a bilious
green which they suffered to con-
tinue until the end of the number.
This effectively squelched Marx’s
frequent attempts to smile.

The height of their good hu-
mor was reached during the
reading of “The Tell Tale
Heart,” when they plunged the
nearsighted Nordine into a pur-
ple gloom which forced him to
the raise the hook nearly to his
nose.

It is also regrettable that the
program was not better planned.
At the time of his greatest con-
trol of the audience Nordine
would succumb either to modesty
or laziness and say, “Well how
about a little Dick Marx?” Unfor
tunately the audience wanted a
little more Nordine.

Accustomed to a fifteen min-
ute television show, Nordine a|>-
parently does not have confi-
dence in his ability to sustain
audience interest for a longer
period of time. There appeared
to be no justification for this
belief.

Despite technical inconveni-
ences. however, the show’ was well
worth seeing. The richness of
Nordine’s voice, his great ease and
charm, and the variety of his ex-
pression were quite sufficient to
overcome the doubts of his listen-
ers on the value of literary read-
ing.

You Can’t Buy It!

Numerous publications are available at your campus
bookstore representing various student interests. We had
hoped to be able to announce that The American Socialist,
America’s newest radical publication was also available.
We feel on the basis of our first nine months’ experience
that there should be sufficient student interest in a
realistic socialist magazine to warrant its sale on campus.

Unfortunately our attempts to have the American
Socialist placed in your bookstore have met with repeated
refusals, which evade a legitimate reason why the maga-
zine should not be available to students who may wash
to buy it.

While the University has found fit to subscribe to the
American Socialist for its periodical room, and numerous
students and faculty members are subscribers, the book-
store has used the excuses that they were not interested
in carrying anothr socialist magazine, and that there is
not enough interest in such a magazine.

Certainly no new magazine can create interest or
become known and purchased if not available or dis-
played. We feel that the question is not one of student
interest, for we are sure there is much potential interest
if the proper trial effort is made. The real issue at stake
here is whether the bookstore shall be the market-store
for the free dissemination of ideas.

We’re sorry that the American Socialist isn’t available
on campus. However, the question of whether our maga-
zine, as a magazine of dissenting opinion will be made
available to the student body is solely dependent on the
actions of the students themselves.

Appleton'Field piano team

The dtK>-pianist team of Vera Appleton and Michael Field

"Are Joe's friends running in Illinois?” was the subject of an open forum and discussion
sponsored last Tuesday by Robin Hood’s Merrie Men.

The group felt that Senator Joseph McCarthy’s “friends” definitely are running in the
Illinois election, and that “McCarthyism” is an important issue in 1he campaign. They speci-
fically named Joseph T. Meek and Richard Vail as “Joe’s friends.”

The Merrie Men decided to
friends in Illinois. This com-
mittee will do whatever it can
to aid such organizations as
the Independent Voters of Illinois,
Students for Douglas, and Stu-
dents for O’Hara.

Tn addition, the group felt that
individuals should be encouraged
to do everything they can to help
in the program.

Students who Were on campus
last year will recall the Merrie
Men as the group which distrib-
uted green feathers to protest
McCarthyism. They felt the Sena-
tor's influence was manifest in
the alleged attempt of a member

Placing nine runners ahead of Navy Pier’s first, the UC cross country team rolled up a

A somewhat bewildered Pier team got a look at the UC harriers a short time before the

STUDYING MADE SIMPLE

I have passed my thirty-fifth birthday, and my dewlaps droop and
niy transmission needs oil. More and more my eyes turn inward,
reminiscing, sifting the past, browsing lovingly among my souvenirs,
for at my time of life memories are all a man has.

And most precious are the memories of college. It still makes my
pulses quicken and my old glands leap to life just to think of it.
Ah, I was something then! "Swifty” my friends used to call me,
or "Rakehell” or "Candle-at-both-Ends” or "Devil Take the Hind-
most.” My phone was ringing all the time. "Come on, Devil-Take-the-
Hindmost,” a cohort would say, "let’s pile into the old convertible
and live up a storm. I know a place that serves all-bran after hours.”

So it went—night after mad night, kicks upon kicks, sport that
wrinkled care derides, laughter holding both his sides. "Come on,
"Candle-at-Both-Ends,” my companions would plead, "sing us an-
other two hundred verses of Siveet Violets."

"No, my companions,” I would reply with a gentle but firm smile,
"we must turn homeward, for the cock has long since crowed.”

" ’Twas not the cock,” they would answer, laughing merrily.
" ’Twas Sam Leghorn doing his imitation of a chicken!”

And, sure enough, 'twas. Crazy, madcap Sam Leghorn. How I
miss his gaiety and wit! I never tired of hearing his imitation of
a chicken, nor he of giving it. I wonder what’s become of him. Last
I heard he was working1 as a weathervane in Tacoma.

Oh, we were a wild and jolly gang in those days. There was Sam
Leghorn with his poultry imitations. There was Mazda Watts who
always wore a lampshade on her head. There was Freddie Como
who stole a dean. There was Cap Queeg who always carried two
steel marbles in his hand. There was Emily Hamp who gilded her
house mother.

Yes, we were wild and jolly, and the wildest and jolliest was I . . .
But not right away. I blush to admit that in my freshman year I
was dull, stodgy, and normal. I finally corrected this loathesome
condition, but for a while it was touch and go. And, dear reader—
especially dear freshman reader—be warned: it can happen to you.

The makers of Philip Morris have bought this space so I can
bring you a message each week. There is no more important message
I can give you than the following: College can be beautiful. Don’t
louse it up with studying. . '

That was my mistake. At first, cowed by college, 1 studied so much
that I turned into a dreary, blinking creature, subject to dry-mouth
and fainting fits. For a year this dismal condition prevailed—but
then I learned the real function of college. And what is that? I’ll tell
you what: to prepare you to face the realities of the world. And
what do you need to face the realities of the world? I’ll tell you
what—poise, that’s what you need. And how do you get poise? I’ll
’ell you how: not by keeping your nose in a book, you* may be sure!

Relax! Live! Enjoy! . . . That’s how you get poise. Of course you
have* to study, but be poised about it. Don’t be like some clods
who spend every single night buried in a book. Not only are they not
learning poise; they are also eroding their eyeballs. The truly poised
student knows better than to make the whole semester hideous with
studying. He knows that the night before the exam is plenty of time
to study.

Yes, I’ve heard that lots of people have condemned cramming. But
have you heard who these people are? They are the electric light and
power interests, that’s who! They want you to sit up late and study
every night so you’ll use more electricity and enrich their bulging
coffers. Don’t be a sucker! K

Clearly, cramming is the only sensible way to study. But beware!
Even cramming can be overdone. Take it easy. On the night before
your exam, eat a hearty dinner. Then get a date and go out and eat
another hearty dinner. Then go park someplace and light up a
Philip Morris. Enjoy the peaceful pleasure it offers. Don’t go
home until you’re good and relaxed.

Once at home, relax. Do not, however, fall asleep. This is too
relaxed. To insure wakefulness, choose a chair that is not too
comfortable. For example, take a chair with nails pointing up
through the seat—or a chair in which somebody is already sitting.

Place several packs of Philip Morris within easy reach. Good
mild tobacco helps you to relax, and that’s what Philip Morris is—
good mild tobacco. But Philip Morris is more than just good mild
tobacco; it is also cigarette paper to keep the good mild tobacco from
spilling all over the place.

Now you’ve got the uncomfortable chair and the Philip Morris.
Now you need light. Use the lit end of your Philip Morris. *Do not
enrich the electric power interests.

Read your textbook in a slow, poised manner. Do not underline. It
reduces the re-sale value of your book. Always keep your books in
prime re-sale condition; you never know when you’ll need getaway
money.

As you read you will no doubt come across many things you don’t
understand. But don’t panic. Relax. Play some records. Remove a
callus. Go out and catch some night crawlers.

Relax. Be poised. Stay loose. And remember—if things really close
m, you can always take up teaching.

neither team being able to score.
In the last minute of play Wheat-

headed by John Godfrey at inside-

first half, but could not set up

Hutchins Finds Football

Distracting and Immoral

“Chicago dropped football because the game hampered the
University’s efforts to become the kind of institution it as-

pired to be, one devoted to education, research, and scholar-
ship. Intercollegiate football has little to do with any of these

things and an institution that
is to do well in them will have
to concentrate upon them and rid
itself of irrelevancies, no matter
how attractive or profitable,” said
Robert Maynard Hutchins in this
week’s Sports Illustrated.

In an article called “College
Football ’is an Infernal Nuisance,”
former chancellor Hutchins stated
his violent aversion to the distrac-
tions and immorality of the sport
on the collegiate level. Decrying
the fact that football has become
a symbol of college life, Hutchins
quotes the late Jeff Cravath* “The
fact that the system reduces the
boys to perjurers, scalpers, and
football gigolos is ignored.”

He points out that a college
president must know the corrupt
practices that are being used to
build his football squad, but if he
tries to Slop them he runs afoul
of prominent alumni on the board
of trustees or board of regents,
or just alumni with endowment-
available money. The president
needs that money to keep his
school going.

Hutchins places his hope in pro-
fessional football. He looks for a

Athletic Director
Metcalf comments

J. Nelson Metcalf gave the
following comments on the
football question:

On Hutchins: “He refers to
many admitted evils in some
football situations. The fact re-
mains that football is an excel-
lent game and that playing it
can he a valuable experience
for boys physically qualified to
play it, provided it is conduct-
ed on a proper basis. It should
be used as part of the educa-
tional program, and not as a
side show for public entertain-
ment or financial return.”

On Grayson in the Daily
News: “No comment.”

so far that people will not pay to
see collegiate ball. “When profes-
sional football has reached this
point, we shall be able to disen-
tangle-sport and higher educa-
tion,” he says.

“This,” he concludes, “happened

time when it will have progressed at Chicago.”

49ers Practice on Stagg Field

Evidently in accordance with Hutchin's idea of destroying big col-
lege football by advancing professional football teams, the San Fran-
cisco 49ers have been given the use of Stagg Field for practice ses-
sions this week. Over thirty mighty graduates of college ball have
been bruising each other there since Wednesday. On Sunday they will
try to bruise the Chicago Bears, but not on Stagg. The game will be a
regular professional contest.

WAA at Illinois Normal

Three members of the Women’s Athletic association journeyed to
Illinois Normal last weekend for a meeting of the Illinois Athletic
federation of college women. WAA president Elenie Kostopolus, vice
president Trudy Martin, and volleyball manager Sandy Ford dis-
cussed and compared function of women’s athletics at member schools
Chicago, Illinois, Concordia, Bradley, and Wheaton. WAA is open to
any woman student who participates in at least one major sport.

Red Cross to Rescue

After all the rain earlier this week, the American Red Cross has
sent out a release stating that registrations are still being accepted
for Red Cross water safety and senior life saving classes which opened
Tuesday at Ida Noyes pool, 1212 E. 59th. Men and women 16 years
of age or over who can swim at least 100 yards are eligible to take the
life saving course. The water safety instructor course is open to any-
one 18 years of age or over who is able to pass Red Cross swimming
and life saving tests. Only a nominal fee is charged.

Touchball Postponed

Also owing to the heavy rain, intramural touchball games in all
leagues have been postponed until next week. IM tennis is underway
in spite of the bogg weather, a winner to be determined in the com-
ing week. Questions concerning intramurals should be addressed to
IM director Kooman Boycheff, Bartlett 105.

Foothall Qood

For Nation:

Daily News

“For three months now there
has been juicy talk in pubs and
clubs of a football renaissance at
the University of Chicago . . . sad-
ly we relate that all the talk is just
that,” said Harry Grayson in the
Chicago Daily News last Sunday.

Once again a wave of nostalgia
for the old days of cheering stands
and winning teams at Chicago has
expressed itself. This time the
Daily News recalled the “happier
days when ‘Stagg feared Pur-
due’ ” and Walter Eckersall, Hugo
Bezdek. and Jay Berwanger
helped Saturday’s games become
Sundays headlines.

The News quoted athletic direc-
tor T. Nelson Melcalf as saying,
“If and when the University of
Chicago increases sufficiently in
size, and includes enough men
who can play football, Chicago
may reinstate football at the col-
lege, not the university, level.”

Commented the News, “Met-
calf's statement smacks of the
‘football is a dangerous game’
thinking, which so many of our
eminent empty-heads have been
loudly proclaiming for so long.”
Former chancellor Hutchins
would seem to fall into this cate-
gory.

Even though the article called
all-out pressure for football bad,
it warned that “these are times
for the strong only,” and con-
cluded, "you would think college
men could get together on middle
ground and have everybody play-
ing a game that is good for the
nation.”

No direct reference to Hutchins
or his theory of the relation be-
tween sport and higher education
was made in the article.

We realize that our program is am-

brought into being when, and only
when, there is a real involvement of the
student body in the decision-making
process of SG. Toward this end, we pro-
pose :

1.	That SG make use of campus ref-
erenda, opinion polls, regular news-
letters, and discussion groups.

2.	A constitutional amendment to
insure vacancy replacement policies
which abide by the decision of the
campus and prevent partisan packing.

3.	A complete investigation and
consideration of the structure and
operations of SG directed toward the
establishment of more democratic
procedures.

We of SRP pledge our co-operation
with all who join in supporting any of

THE CHICAGO MAROON

October 15, 1954

Tolerance Possible Only

With Truth, Love, Intellect

“Can tolerance be reconciled with enthusiasm for a cause?” was the fundamental problem
which Jacques Maritain, French philosopher, discussed in a lecture at Mandel hall, Thurs-

day, October 7.

He concluded that they are reconcilable if only truth, love, and the resources of the intel-
lect are used by the defender of one view to gie justice to another. And as these three quali-

ties are inherent in all great philosophical and religious ideas,

This was the first of two
seminars by Maritain on the
subject, “Tolerance; its mean-
ing and practical implication.” In
this first lecture, “Truth and tol-
erance,” he discussed three major
topics: the general notion of tol-
erance, philosophical justice and
tolerance, and co-operation be-
tween different religious faiths.

Skeptics Intolerant

He attacked the view that the
only answer to intolerance is skep-
ticism. The skeptic believes that
anyone with convictions will auto-
matically tend to impose them on
others and thus make living to-
gether impossible. It follows that
the only answer is the elimination
of convictions.

“These people are the most in-
tolerant of all. Skepticism is the
intolerance of doubt,” said Mari-
tain.

The skeptic misses the point
that “in reality, it is through ra-
tional means—persuasion and not
force—that man, the rational ani-
mal, forwards his views, and not
through holy war. From this
comes our belief that people have

Jacques Maritain

the right to self-government.” A
denial of man’s rational nature
leads directly to tyranny such as
Stalinism.

But there would be more than

the goal is certainly attainable,
simply man’s rational nature to
temper intolerance. “Truth must
be purified by genuine love. He
who places in hell those who dis-
agree with him offends his own
God.”

Maritain then dealt specifically
with tolerance in philosophy and
religion.

Systems Do Justice

He pointed out that there is a
“central intuition in all great doc-
trines” which recognizes that it
has a place in the universe of
thought and that other doctrines
also have a place in that universe.
Thus each system, taken as a
unity in itself, can do justice to
other systems.

In theology, tolerance is reached
through mutual love of God. This
is possible since we are dealing
with a fellowship of men and not
of beliefs. It is a kind of forgive-
ness for the condition of men.

“Here the ‘judge not’ of the gos-
pel applies with full force. We
cannot judge the innermost heart
—all we can do it trust in God.
And this is just what love and tol-
erance would have us do.”

Faculty Softball Averts Loss;

Beats Student Team 7-9

In a thrilling struggle last Friday, the faculty softball team
was narrowly beaten by an eight inning, 3-run hitting spree
by the entering students team, 7-9 in 9 innings. ‘After jumping
off to a 5-0 lead in the first inning, the faculty saw its lead
slowly chipped away while the students settled down to allow
only 2 more runs for the rest of the game.

In the absence of a star
pitcher for the students, Neal
Huffucker, a second year stu-

dent pitched for the students, by
agreement with the faculty. After
a rocky first inning. Huffacker,
replete with a tricky slow ball and
red earmuffs, held back the fac-
ulty while the students went on
to win.

Stuart Tave started for the
faculty and confused the stu-
dent hitters during most of the
first half of the game. However,
when the students began timing
his pitches and hitting him well,
he was replaced by Mark Ashin.
faculty captain, who had been
playing shortstop. The game was
sparked by masterminding on
both sides, including juggling of
players and positions, and an in-
tentional walk.

Play Two Games

The student team was organ-
ized and managed by George
Athanson. who was also chief um-
pire. After the game. Reader’s
Campus Drug store provided free
cokes and pretzels to the partici-
pants.

The faculty team plays two

games every year, with the enter-
ing students in the fall, and the
dormitory champs in the spring.
It was organized four years ago
and presently has a record of 3
won and 5 lost. A highly informal
group with about six regular
members, the team consists of
University faculty and staff mem-
bers.

Donald Meiklejohn, star third-
baseman for the faculty, com-
mented that perhaps this points
out something about the new en-
tering class. "They’re supposed to

Lists Jobs

Clerical jobs are in most de-
mand; among others listed by
the service are hospital work,
driving of trucks and cars, com-
munity center w'ork and library
work.

“A student who comes to the
University with skill in typing
has a good chance to get a job,”
said Mrs. Metcalf. “And one who
can take stenogaphy has an even
better chance.” A typing test is
given to applicants, with a speed
of 50 words per minute general-
ly required for most jobs.

A student applicant for part-
time work first fills out an appli-
cation and is interviewed by
Mrs. Metcalf, who informs him
of available jobs which seem
suited to his particular abilities.

Service Provided

Baby sitting openings are list-
ed by the office as a special serv-
ice to interested students, who
must register and be interviewed
in order to be eligible to secure
listings.

“There are as many and as
varied jobs as you would find
outside of school,” commented
Mrs. Metcalf. Among the most
unusual she cited were the stu-
dents who worked for CBS dur-
ing the presidential campaigns
and the person who modelled
trusses for an othopedic asso-
ciation’s meeting.

Non-academic jobs on campus,
on a full-time basis, are handled
through the office by Miss Mary
Farrelly. These openings include
all service jobs on campus, with
many hospital openings.

The general increasing unem-
ployment trend has affected jobs
available fo students at the Uni-
versity as well. “We’re having to
intensify our efforts to find
jobs,” said Bjorling, “and it’s a
two-way proposition in that the
number of jobs available is de-
pendent on how well the students
do.” Since there are fewer open-
ings, it is also necessary to be
more selective in recommending
jobs to students, he pointed out.
