Top ten candidates express views

Yesterday and today the student body of the University of Chicago went about the process of electing w,n make the hail jump as they
delegates to the seventh annual National Students Association convention. The election, heralded by both XdinmiX^10 °* * ^
ISL and SRP as extremely important, has been marked with great pre-election campaigning and intense “ The first part of the program

feelings.

Of the three groups into
which the candidates are
divided, the National Repre-
sentatives are considered the
most important. The MAROON,
in an effort to bring to the campus
the views of the political parties,
interviewed all candidates in the
“top five.” -

Clive Gray, president of Stu-
dent Government and a candidate,
stressed the accomplishments of
this year’s SG and ISL’s five year
record at NSA conventions. He
said:

“The ISL candidates believe that
their work this year in Student
Government and the experience
they and other ISLers have gotten
as Chicago’s representatives to the
last five NSA congresses qualify
them to be sent to this year’s con-
gress also.

“In putting through the news
student service center and the
housing co-operative, the ISL can-
didates have shown honest per-
severance, and, they believe, abil-
ity to a higher degree than their
opponents. If sent to the Seventh
NSA Congress this summer, they
pledge themselves to a program
which will be carried out with sim-
ilar perseverance.

“I feel very strongly that if the
campus wants really responsible

Consider Mayflower hotel
for housing co-op location

A cooperative housing project may be set up next year by
Student Government if enough students sign up. Although
SG was unable to arrange for a loan from the University to
buy a house, plans are underway to rent part of a building.

The proposed cooperative would be located in the Mayflow-
er Hotel at 6125 Kenwood Avenue. These are the terms of the

co-op:

1.	The entire second floor
in the Mayflower Hotel would
be leased to the SG co-operative
group, comprising 140 students.

2.	Two students will be accom-
modated iii each of the 70 rooms
on the floor, and will pay rentals
directly to the treasurer of the
group.

3.	Each student would pay an
average of $25 rent per month, on
the basis of two per room.

4.	The hotel management pro-
vides electricity, heating, all fur-
nishings, and decorating services
to the students. In addition, it
would remove a partition between
two extra rooms, for which no
rental was charged, and furnish
them as a common-room and meet-
ing quarters for the co-op.

Student Government will set up
formation tables all over cam-

delegates to be sent to the NSA
Congress, then it should continue,
as in the past five years, to place
its trust in ISL.”

The position which SRP has
taken in the election was ex-
pressed by Paul Breslow, leader
of the minority party in SG. He
noted that ISL had not answered
the questions which his party has
put forth. Breslow also went on to
define the basis for NSA strength.
His formal statement reads:

“SRP has offered to the cam-
pus. in its platform and supple-
mehtary material, a detailed con-
crete liberal program for NSA
which deals’with the main issues
of concern to students. I wish that
for once ISL would discuss the
proposals which we have made,
on such issues as academic free-
dom week, discrimination, UMT,
international exchange and the
economic crisis in education,
rather than the vague, cynical and
irrelevant campaign we have seen
thus far. We don’t suggest NSA
can cure the ills of mankind; its
power rests in the faith and con-
victions’of the American student.

‘.‘Our program is NOT pie in the
sky, but it offers more than a
few stale crumbs for purely local
consumption.”

Continuing SRP’s position, Dave
Bobrow, an independent running
with SRP endorsement, centered
his discussion on a definition of
the main campaign issue and an
explanation of why he is running
as an independent with SRP back-
ing.

“The key campaign issue is
whether or not NSA can become
a strong effective representative
of American students. The Amer-
ican student is currently without
such effective representation. The
NSA was set up to actively advo-
cate the wishes of students on
matters both off and on campus.
I agree with the other members of
the SRP slate that a platform
which emphasizes action on dis-
crimination, student exchange,
UMT. and economic problems con-
fronting students and universities
is both good and practical. The
SRP slate is composed of indi-
viduals capable of aiding NSA in
arriving at a sound position in

pus next week in order to publi-
cize the co-op project and sign up
residents for next fall. If the in-
terest proves great enough, SG
announced, it will bring the proj-
ect before the Administration for
final approval before the middle
of this quarter.

Interviewed by the MAROON
Wednesday night, Clive Grey,
president of SG, described the
proposal as extremely favorable.
Upon examining the hotel Gray
said he had found the rooms suit-
ably spacious for two occupants,
and was much impressed with the
fact that each room had an indi-
vidual bathroom and shower. He
added that the hotel contained an
automatic launderette, a sizeable
lounge, and television • viewing
room on the first floor, and em-
phasized that its fire-prevention
system met fully with modern

these areas. I disagree with oppo-
sition charges that ‘freedom of
thought, freedom from fear, free-
dom from racial and religious dis-
crimination and freedom from
want’ are hollow rhetoric. I be-
lieve that words are only hollow
when their speaker does not in-
tend to actively support them. We
independents are running because
we support these concepts. We
have accepted SRP endorsement
because be believe it is the only
political party at this University
which will positively work in NSA
for the preservation and encour-
agement of the four freedoms.”

Eli Stein, chairman of SG’s com-
mittee on recognized student or-
ganizations, voiced ISL’s defini-
tion of NSA and ,went on to ex-
press his views on his and his par-
ty’s qualifications:

SC committee drops one,
keeps another on ballot

One independent candidate in the current National Student
Association elections has been dropped from the ballot. An-
other candidate’s name is on the ballot by a decision of the
election and rules committee of Student Government over-
ruling a recommendation of Student Activities Director Wil-

liam Birenbaum.

Independent Franklin Loo-
mos’ name was stricken from
the ballot when it was pointed
out that he does not meet the con-
stitutional requirements concern-
ing grades. Loomos had filed for
national delegate along with Phil-
ip Wyatt, a fellow member of the
track team and the only candidate
remaining in the race not en-
dorsed by a political party.

Miss Joli Lasker, Independent
Students League candidate for re-
gional alternate, kept her name
on the ballot by appealing Biren-
baum’s recommendation to the
elections committee.

Acrotheatre’s spring show
features Mexican routines

A New Mexican motif has been selected for this year’s Acro-
theatre production, scheduled for next week end at Mandel
Hall.

Titled “Acrodeo,” the show features modern dance and
ballet routines as influenced by Mexican Indian, Spanish and
Western cowboy costumes and specialties.

With an emphasis on the
creative dance, the production
will include a toyshop scene,

night life number, a toreador
scepe and a Mexican folk dance.

'Sunset', impression

Mrs. Dolores Wharton, wife of
a UC student who is doing re-
search work, has created for Acro-
deo an impression of “Sunset”
from the Grand Canyon Suite.

Louise Fechheimer has created
a novelty dance, “Dude Indian,”
for the show and Dorothy King is
doing a magician number.

Indian war dance

A solo authentic Fox Indian war
dance has been created by Steve
Polgar, a student of Indian cus-
toms in the anthropology depart-
ment. Polgar has obtained a full
war costume from a Fox Indian.

Despite the shift to dance em-
phasis, Acrotheatre has included a
trampoline act based on a bunk-
house bed early in the morning
as'well as juggling and tumbling
acts.

Birenbaum’s challenge to her
candidacy was made in a letter to
the committee revealing her grade
average is below C. Miss Lasker
appealed on the grounds that the
low grade had not been reported
to her by test administration at
the time she filed for nomination.

The committee, headed by Mar-
lin Smith (ISL-law), ruled that
only grades known before the
final day for filing may rule out
candidates. Miss Lasker, a stu-
dent in the college, remains a
valid candidate, pending a possible
appeal to the Student-Faculty-Ad-
ministration Court.

Qore declares ‘Joe must go’

Keisen: 'Absolutist philosophy

in academic freedom speech

The originator of the "Joe Must Go” recall movement in
Wisconsin, editor Leroy Gore, spoke before a group of stu-
dents in Mandel Hall on April 15 during Academic Freedom
Week. He was sponsored by the UC chapter of Robin Hood’s
Merrie Men.

Gore, who began the movement fo recall Senator McCarthy

incompatible with democracy

from the Senate, called the
response to the recall petition
“unbelievable.” Of the 403,000 sig-
natures necessary to recall Mc-
Carthy, over 185,000 had been ob-
tained a week before Gore’s talk.

He described the large volume
of letters received from people
both inside and outside Wisconsin
as encouraging. “However,” he
stated, “we also receive many

Swift Hall will be the meeting
place of the federated theological
school’s second annual “Student
Conference” on Wednesday and
Thursday.

The conference, initiated by the
student bodies of the four theo-
logical schools on campus and
now joined by “federated” faculty
members, has as its goal a better
understanding and a more inti-
mate "community between stu-
dent and student, faculty and fac-
ulty, and student and faculty. The
general subject matter for these
addresses and discussions was de-
cided after polling the student
bodies to see what problem was of
most concern.

Four principal addresses will
serve to define the nature of the
conference. Speakers and their
subjects are as follows: Bernard
E. Meland, “An Age in Between;”
Daniel Day Williams, “The Re-
sponse of the Christian Faith;”
John B. Thompson, “The Chal-
lenge of Rival Faiths;” and Mal-
lory Fitzpatrick, “The Present
Crisis and Our Vocation.” Discus-
sions will follow each talk and
will serve to point up student and
faculty reactions.

A worship service will open
each day of the conference in
Rockefeller Chapel at 9 a.m.
Lunch will be served daily, but
only for those who have made
reservations by noon Monday.

Freedom views given by Urey,
Wick, Bettelheim, Llewellyn

Academic freedom in its relation to the educational disciplines was discussed by Harold
Urey of the natural sciences, Warner Wick of the humanities, Bruno Bettelheim of the so-
cial sciences, and Karl Llewellyn of law, on April 15 in Mandel Hall.

Urey defined academic freedom as "the right to express in our classrooms whatever view
we hold to be correct in our special field, without veto from the university or investigating
committees. This implies the right of the student to study whatever he wants,” he added.

This definition of academic
freedom, Urey quickly pointed

out, is a very limited one. “What
is a classroom and what is a spe-
cialty? We can’t quite say what
the limits of our classrooms or
our specialties are,” he declared.
Universities shouldn't conform

“Most people in a country like
the US conform,” Urey continued.
“But conformity is foreign to the
ideals of a university. They pay
professors to produce new ideas.
It is possible to make a university
conform, but when you get
through you won’t have a univer-
sity.”

Wick, of the philosophy depart-
ment, discussed the necessity to
philosophy of having academic
freedom. “The philosopher ex-
amines things that weren’t before
examined,” he declared. “Phil-
osophy must live in freedom or it
cannot exist. When we are not
doing our business (free examina-
tion) we are the most useless fac-
ulty of the university.”

Universities limit freedom

According to Bettelheim, repres-
sions of academic freedom have
often come from within the uni-
versities themselves. He said by
way of illustration, “Let me tell
you about my great master Freud.
He taught, but he didn’t have a
clinic. It was not the government,
but the colleagues who didn’t like
Freud’s teachings. The students

threatening letters, letters which
promise kidnapping, assault, and
other similar types of attack.”
Gore suggested that letters of this
sort reflect the type of leadership
McCarthy affords his followers.

Gore felt that if the necessary
signatures were procured by May
17, the deadline, the constitution-
al problem involved in the recall
could be surmounted. The prob-
lem is found in the fact that the
federal constitution provides for
impeachment of a Senator only by
the Senate. “However,” Gore stat-
ed, “this provision was made be-
fore the right to elect Senators
was given directly to the people.” ।

“Even though I supported Me- ;
Carthy in the 1952 election, his
methods embarrassed me.” He ।
compared McCarthy’s methods in :
hunting Communists to “shooting ]
fleas off a dog with a shotgun; (
you don’t get rid of any fleas, but <
you do kill the dog.

who wanted to study under him
weren’t called before congression-
al committees, but they knew they
could get into lots of trouble.”

Must take risks

Llewellyn posed the question,
“Isn’t the risk (of repression of
freedom) in organizations such as
the university one that we have
to take?” He declared, “The law
says that you have to take the
risks of living. There are some
limits you can put on, but they’ve

by Arthur Solomon	,	.	,

A definition of democracy which emphasizes its character as a method and procedure for
reaching political decisions, rather than as a system serving a preconceived "public interest,”
was stressed on Monday by Hans Keisen, professor in the Naval War College, and a noted •
scholar in the fields of jurisprudence, political theory and international law.

In the first of a series of six Walgreen lectures on "The Foundations of Democracy,” Kei-
sen observed that the 20th century has seen the rise of several totalitarian ideologies. Of

these, Soviet Communism is
the most challenging to de-
mocracy, since its appeal is for-
mulated in democracy’s own
terms.

Keisen asserted that a funda-
mental component of this appeal
of totalitarianism to advocates of
democracy is a distortion which
has arisen in the definitions of
democracy. This distortion Keisen
held to be a shift in emphasis
from government “by the people”
to the insistence on government
“for the people.”

Assumes objective public interest

According to Keisen this distor-
tion of the original meaning of
democracy starts from the as-
sumption that there is an objec-
tively ascertainable public inter-
est which the public may not itself
realize. The next step is the for-
mulation of “elite” theories, gov-
ernment by an “avant garde,” and
charismatic leadership. According
to this line of reasoning, any gov-

got to be a little loosish in order to
have room for greatness to go on.”

Llewellyn asked again, “How
can you protect people and still
get those investigations done that
have to be done?” In answer, he
stated, “Lawyers are now at work
under the impact of recent events
to try to iron out and furnish
rules for congressional inquiries
in the same way that they have
furnished rules for other types of
inquiries.”

ernment may call itself demo-
cratic if it claims to be serving
what it believes to be the public
interest.

As the primary modern example
of this distortion, Keisen pointed
to communist theory and practice,
which decries the representative
element in western democracy as
“purely formal,” and which claims
to possess absolute knowledge of
the interests of the proletariat. It
is this very claim, Keisen asserts,
which makes a sham out of the
democratic pretenses of contem-
porary communism. For democ-
racy as representative govern-
ment assumes that a fixed, eternal
plan of social organization does
not exist, and therefore society
must be content with a method for
continually revising the social
norms with the greatest possible
participation by its individual
members. Keisen »expressed the
view that what Lenin decries as
“formal” is the essence of democ-
racy, and the only bulwark
against autocracy.

'Absolutism vs. democracy'

The objective of his first two
lectures, which are titled “Democ-
racy and Philosophy,” Keisen said,
is to indicate a correlation be-
tween absolutist philosophy, and

Kimpton talks on
UC frat relations

Questions of University rela-
tions with the fraternities will be
discussed by members of the In-
ter-Fraternity Council and Chan-
cellor Lawrence A. Kimpton at
their annual dinner next Thurs-
day.

This year’s dinner is being giv-
en by the Kappa Alpha Psi alumni
and will begin at 6 p.m. April 29
at their house at 4752 Ellis.

Three representatives from

each fraternity on campus will
have an opportunity to ask- the
chancellor about current Univer-
sity policy toward the fraternities.
They will also have a chance to
tell him about fraternity activ-
ities this year.

political theories which ignore the 'l
importance of representative gow I
ernment. He went on to suggest a
connection between philosophical
relativistic and the democratic
theory which sees the need fori
continual participation by all in
reaching political decision.

Continuing his analysis of the
two philosophic systems in his
second lecture on Wednesday, Kei-.
sen attempted to show that civic
rights, equality, and tolerance of
minority opinion were the neces-
sary political consequences of
relativistic philosophy. Since the
relativist cannot claim that an
eternal truth can be found, he
must support “freedom of cogni-
tion” in order that decisions can
be adapted to new times and situa-
tions. For' the relativist, Keisen
declared, the minority opinion
must always be able to become
the majority opinion; the abso-
lutist who has reached eternal
truth will only find his goal im-
peded by allowing those less sapi-
ent to be heard.

Discuss aims of

business school

A picture of the curriculum and
aims of the school of business will
be discussed Wednesday after-
noon at 3:30 p.m. Members of the
faculty and student body will take
part in the discussion to be heM
in the second floor lounge of Has-
kell Hall.

The discussion is the result of a
recent survey which indicated that
although few of the college stu-
dents enter the school of business,
a high percentage of them enter
the business world. The school,
according to a recent bulletin,
feels this situation is unfortunate
and is largely due to the lack ol
knowledge concerning business
education.

Crammed full of pictures, humor, graduates of this and
other years, spiced with analyses of campus academics and
critiques of campus organizations. Cap and Gown, UC’s con-
troversial year book, appears again on campus on or around
May 15.

“You can save the price of a martini if you reserve your

copy now,” says Ed Maupin,
Cap and Gown editor. People
waiting until after May 14 will

have to pay $4.50 for their issues.
People putting $2 down before
publication date will save 50 cents.

This year’s edition introduces a
new campus magazine as a sup-
plement to the yearbook. Called
the Phoenix, the magazine will
take “a humorous approach to
campus life.”

Maupin promised a “thrilling
expose of the college” by Robert
Streeter, new dean of the college.
There will also be “thrilling ex-
poses” of all the other divisions of
the University, Maupin said.

This year's edition will contain
such miscellaneous information as
the numbers of the outside phones
in the men’s and women’s dorms
(“just the thing for calling your
girl after the switchboard
closed”) and the recipe for Mrs.

Chase new head
of University’s
education dept.

Francis S. Chase, director
of the Midwest Administration
Center, has been named chair-
man of the University’s depart-
ment of education.

Chase, professor of educational
administration, succeeds Maurice
F. Seay who will become director
of the education division of the
W. K. Kellogg Foundation.

The new chairman is president
of the Education Communications
Service, which he founded, and
has been a member of the UC fac-
ulty since 1945.

Before that he served on the
wartime commission for the Of-
fice of Education and as executive
secretary of the Virginia Educa-
tion Association.

Chase has bachelor’s and mas-
ter’s degrees from the University
of Virginia and in 1951 added a
PhD from the University of Chi-
cago.

The SAB activities are
based, as Terry Lunsford,
admissions counselor working
with the group has said, on the
idea that “the best publicity for a
good college program is the in-

of students who have profited
from it.” The organization is open
to any student in the university.
Its next meeting is at Ida Noyes
Hall, next Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.

The main work of the board is
to advise Mrs. McCarn on ways
of encouraging students who have
been admitted to the college to
matriculate. Roughly 1400 people

Part of the work of the Student Advisory Board extends to showing prospective students around ihe UC

Knickerbocker Hotel site of next year's
Washington Promenade, announces SU

The Knickerbocker Hotel has been chosen for the site of next year’s Washington Promen-
ade. Plans for the dance were formulated by the Dance committee of SU and submitted to
the 11-member SU Board where they were approved in toto.

All plans made thus far are tentative and still must be approved by the administration.

An attendance of 350 couples at this year’s Wash Prom and gross receipts of $1,750 led
SU, in anticipation of a crowd of at least equal size for next year’s dance, to set next year’s
dance budget at approximate-
ly $1,750. Seven hundred dol-
lars or less of this sum will
pay for a band.

Feeling that the $1500 expense
of a big band such as Woody Her-
man’s could not be justified, the
Board decided to choose next
year’s band solely on the basis of
its ability to play good dance mu-
sic, not on the basis of its name.

The choice of locations was be-
tween either Bartlett, a south side
hotel, or an off-campus hotel. As-
suming full administrative re-
sponsibility for the decision, the
Board chose the near-north side
Knickerbocker Hotel. The only

year, according to Mrs. McCarn,
but only 314 came around to ma-
triculate. Some had applied to
UC only as a second choice, in
case they were refused by the
school they favored. Others, fail-
ing in their attempts to get ad-
equate scholarship aid, could not
come because they lacked money.
There remained, however, a “crit-
ical” number, according to Mrs.
McCarn, who were frightened off
by the University’s reputation for
unusual intelligence in its stu-
dents and heavy work loads in
its curriculum. It is this latter
group that the Board tries to
bring to Chicago.

Here at the University the

other hotel worthy of considera-
tion within the budget was the
Shoreland. The smallness of the
Shoreland ballroom, the size and
attractiveness of the Knickerbock-
er’s glass-floored ballroom, and
the proximity of the Knickerbock-
er to, many north side night spots
decided them in favor of the
Knickerbocker.

To accommodate couples with-
out cars SU will subsidize taxi
fares to the north side hotel. SU
will negotiate with a taxi com-
pany to offer reduced rates; then
SU will pay up to half of each of
the fares with money from the
dance budget.

group works closely with the Ori-
entation Board. They arrange for
and conduct tours. They get in
contact with prospective students
in their home towns. They keep in
close contact with their old high
school teachers.

Several weeks ago, 446 Chicago
high-school students, on campus
for scholarship exams, were
taken in tow by Board members.
“Many,” said Mrs. McCarn, “were
in low spirits after the exams.*
The reassurances of students al-
ready in the University probably
saved many prospective students
who would have been otherwise
frightened away, Mrs. McCan
felt. -

Busy freedom week at UC

During Academic Freedom Week over 2000 students, fac-
ulty, and administration personnel of UC signed the reaffirma-
tion of the Bill of Rights. Plays, forums, and speeches dealing
with basic American freedoms saturated the campus. A great
jnany groups cooperated in sponsoring the Week.

All the organizations working on Academic Freedom Week,
especially the Academic Freedom Week committee, deserve
credit for a job well done.

However, lest it be thought that only during a week de-
voted to it, is academic freedom taken seriously, we would
like to point out that UC is one of the relatively few campuses
where students and faculty do not have to be afraid of ad-
vocating unpopular views.

This preservation of academic freedom on our campus has,
perhaps, four main causes:

First, a UC tradition which encourages freedom of ex-
pression ;

Second, a student body which demands open discussion;

Third, a faculty which often is willing to take vocal and
intelligent stands on issues;

Fourth, an administration, headed by Chancellor Kimpton,
which refuses to penalize students or faculty members for
praise particularly for its tacit (if not vocal) support of the
[acuity members who refused to testify before the Jenner
committee, and for the Dean of Student’s decision to destroy
Did membership lists of students organizations.

Academic freedom will continue to exist at UC as long as
all segments of the University continue to unite in support-
ing it.

UMT undemocratic

The SRP platform for the NSA
Elections reflects a soundness and
maturity in all its aspects save
one. This essential weakness
stems from SRP’s utter naivete in
regard to its stand on UMT. The
basic fallacy in the statement that
UMT “threatened American stu-
dents with the prospect of a draft
far more extensive . . . than any
previous system in American his-
tory’’ arises from the fact that no
UMT plan yet proposed could
come near equaling the require-
ments in type and length of serv-
ice now demanded of America’s
young men under the Draft Act of
1948 as amended 1951.

Don't the students of SRP know
that a draftee serves two years
and is automatically part of the
reserve on immediate call for
eight years after discharge? Don’t
they know that an ex-serviceman
must file a four-page report on
his personal life once each year
with the Army for the reserve
period of eight years? Don’t they
know that hundreds of thousands
of troops were sent to Korea to
fight for their lives with only six
weeks basic infantry training?

For the past six years this coun-
try has been in an international
power struggle. Now men are
needed to augment our military
Strength.

armed forces through the Draft
Jaw of 1948, one of the most un-

democratic pieces of legislation
ever foisted upon the young men
of America, have been predomi-
nantly farmers and laborers. The
idea of “deferred’’ responsibility
during a shooting war is going to
be hard to defend when the his-
tory of this era is written.

Never before have brothers
been separated from brothers by
the criteria of college enrollment
and draft test. NSA’s opposition
to UMT and their silence on the
inequities of the draft law is a
pure indictment of this so-called
progressive and enlightened youth
group.

Everyone in favor, but no loan

There will be no student owned co-op this year, but not because of lack of support. The Stu-
dent Interest Committee of the Board of Trustees and the Dean of Students have both come
out in favor of the Student Government backed project. Unfortunately, neither the Board of
Trustees nor the administration is willing to take the responsibility of initiating the project.

The events leading up to this unusual situation, agreement between representatives of
SG, the Board of Trustees, and the administration (and the less unusual situation of no

positive action) are as follows:

In the Autumn Quarter of
this year Clive Gray, presi-
dent of Student Government, went
before the Student Interest Com-
mittee of the Board of Trustees.
He requested that the Board ap-
prove the granting of a loan to
SG so that a student run coopera-
tive housing project could be pur-
chased.

The Student Interest Commit-
tee requested information about
cooperative projects at other uni-
versities, which Grey promptly
furnished. The Committee then
voted to back the loan if it came
before the Board of Trustees. But
the Committee stated that they
would not initiate the action. The
proposal would have to be brought

before the Board of Trustees by because of the rules of the Board.

the administration, they said.

Grey next brought the matter
up before Dean of Students Rob-
ert M. Strozier, in orfler to get the
administration to initiate the ac-
tion. Strozier said that he ap-
proved of the proposal for a co-op,
and he agreed to bring the matter

up

before Chancellor Kimpton.

Arthur

Brown

"Are you now or hove you

ever been o member of the United Stotts
Army?"

Policy misunderstood?

Ten days ago at the dinner
given in C-group halls for mem-
bers of the faculty, Chancellor
Kimpton made a definite commit-
ment to sign the reaffirmation of
the Bill of Rights which has been
circulated around the campus dur-
ing the past week. We would like
to know why he has not as yet
signed this scroll.

We will summarize briefly just
exactly what was said at the din-
ner concerning this. Chancellor
Kimpton was asked what is the
general position of university
presidents and chancellors on
signing petitions, and why he had
refused to sign the reaffirmation
of the Bill of Rights. He replied
that the administration made it a
policy not to sign anything cir-
culated on the campus because it
was impossible to take the time
to read and investigate each of
the numerous petitions which
were brought to him: that he
couldn’t ,recall having seen the
scroll, and because of administra-
tion policy it probably hadn’t got-
ten past his secretary.

Several girls immediately ex-

Kimpton said that he would not
rule on the matter directly, but
would turn it over to his financial
advisers. The financial advisers,
headed by William Harrell, Vice
President in charge of Business
Affairs, expressed doubt that stu-
dents could manage the project.
Thus the administration did not
initiate the co op before the Board
of Trustees.

The situation now stands with
the Dean of Students in favor of
the co-op, the Student Interest
Committee of the Board of Trus-
tees in favor of the co-op, but
with neither willing to initiate dis-
cussion of the project. SG, which
would be happy to start proceed-
ings, is unable to bring the mat-
ter before the Board of Trustees

In this unfortunate circum-
stance, SG is doing the only thing
it can: it is trying to rent living
quarters for a co-op. SG hopes
that someone will decide to in-
itiate the loan when students
prove that they can manage their
own building.

plained to him just what it was
that he was being asked to sign,
why it was being circulated and
what they hoped the scroll would
accomplish.

As one of the girls present said,
“Mr. Kimpton, I don't believe the
Bill of Rights will need much
investigation.’’

Thereupon Mr. Kimpton said
that he could see no reason why
he shouldn’t sign this—he was cer-
tainly against McCarthyism and
that if the scroll was brought di-
rectly to him he would definitely
sign it.

One week later a letter from
Dean Strozier to the chairman of
the Academic Freedom Week
Committee informed us that Mr.
Kimpton had decided that there
must have been some misunder-
standing as to what he said. His
policy has been to sign no peti-
tions and he could see no reason
why he should change it.

A mystery of two watches ad-

cleared up as a result of minor
differences detected on the time
pieces.

Two weeks ago the MAROON

about a man's Bulova watch that
had been lost. The same issue car-
ried another ad about a man's
Bulova watch that had been found.

But the happiness of the loser
at spotting the other ad was short-
lived. It wasn’t his watch after all.

Loser Fred Solomon found that
the recovered watch was the same
make and model as his but it had
yellow gold and had initials en-
graved on it. Solomon’s watch is
white gold and has no initials.

Meanwhile the watch that was
found is waiting for its owner at
the information desk in the ad-
ministration building.

The watch that Solomon lost is
still missing, and the owner would
appreciate it if anyone who finds
it calls him at DOrchester 3-8017.

WUCB plans expansion

INT House gets transmitter

WUCB, the University’s student radio station, has an-
nounced plans for future expansion, which will include in-
stallation of a new transmitter at International House.

John Lyon, WUCB station manager, stated that arrange-
ments for construction of the transmitter have already been
completed, and that operation is expected to begin in the
coming fall quarter. Cbmple-

tion of the International
House transmitter will leave
only Gates-Blake and Hitchcock-
Snell dormitories not included in
the WUCB network. The next sta-
tion project will be to expand its
facilities to cover these areas.

When the International House
transmitter is completed, the po-
tential listening audience of
WUCB will be increased to 1100
persons. The new transmitter will
be capable of reproducing the en-
tire frequency range of the high
fidelity broadcasting done by
WUCB. In addition to the present
studio location in B-J, many new
programs will originate directly
from International House.

In addition to the new equip-
ment, WUCB is also making an
attempt to rebroadcast FM sta-
tion WFMT.

Permission has been granted by
WFMT and the only remaining
step is to have the WUCB an-
tenna moved. This would add to
the already expanded WUCB pro-
gram schedule which includes
“Perspective,” a general news an-
alysis, and “Wheel of Fortune,” a
documentary history of the work
of vocalist Kay Starr. Other re-
cent additions to the WUCB pro-
gram list are “The Jeffersonian

Qold cup, books,
prizes in contest
by Camera Club

The Camera Club sponsored its
annual photo contest Wednesday
night in Eckhart 202. This com-
petition, which was open to all
University students, attracted ap-
proximately 60 entries in divisions
for both black and white and col-
ored photos.

Judges for the contest were
Harold Hayden, associate profes-
sor of humanities in the college,
and James Glaze, head of the
photographic department of Bill-
ings Hospital. Prints were judged
on the basis of technical pro-
ficiency in reproduction, the qual-
ity of the finished prints, and their
overall composition.

Winners in each division were
awarded gold cups for their first
place efforts. Second and third
prize winners received sets of
photography books presented by
the University Bookstore.

All prints are on display in the
Reynold’s Club Lounge for a full
week beginning yesterday.

Shugg given
press post

The new executive editor of the
University Press will be Roger W.
Shugg. Shugg will be in charge of
the editorial and financial opera-
tions of the press and will work
under Morton Grodzins who stays
on as editor.

Shugg had previously been di-
rector of Rutgers University
Press. He had also been an assist-
ant professor of history at Indi-
ana University and then an associ-
ate professor of history at Prince-
ton University.

Following this he became the
editor and manager of the college
department of Alfred A. Knopf,

Lost and Found full,
urge student inquiry

Many articles including keys,
watches, pens and umbrellas have
been left unclaimed at the Univer-
sity Lost and Found Office. Locat-
ed at the Administration Build-
ing’s information desk, the Lost
and Found Office has also ac-
quired quantities of textbooks,
glasses, clothes and jewelry in its
backlog. Mrs. R. Thompson, di-
rector of the information desk, ad-
vises students to inquire about
lost articles first at the Lost and
Found, rather than relying on bul-
letin boards and department of-
fices.

Because of lack of space, all
articles are held at the desk for
only thirty days. At the end of
thirty days books are turned over
to the Student Book Exchange,
and clothing placed in a backlog.
Twice a year the backlog is re-
moved by a rummage sale, the
profits of which go to the Lab
School.

“True to the tradition of his so-

Even more important, Gray
continued, was the fact that the
hotel contained central kitchen
facilities, which could be made
available to a students’ eating co-
operative. Food costs for the 140
students on the floor would thus
be cut to the minimum level.

Gray stated that the second
floor would be reserved entirely
for men students, but that a small-
er number of women students
could be accommodated on an-
other floor in the hotel under the
same financial arrangements, if
enough women students showed
an interest in the project.

Dean of Students Robert M.

Student work dominates Review Warm nights bring out 'hoods';

The spring-summer issue of the Chicago Review, on sale May 10, will tip the balance of
student and non-student writing to favor students’ works. Over three-quarters of the con-
tributors to the new Review are students.

police chief advises precautions

In the eight years since the founding of the Review, the proportion of student to non-stu-
dent works has increased with each passing year. Twenty-eight students have been contrib-
utors this year, the largest number of student contributors in Review history.

Student authors named	-------------------------------------------------------------

Among the stories, poems,
reviews and essays in the new
Review will be selections by
students Irwin Schulman,
Jamie Redfield, Donald Levine,
Edward Barksdale, James Flinn,
Robert Turner, Virginia Wolcott
and Dave Nelson. The faculty
members whose works will ap-
pear are Joe Gusfield, Charles
Hartshorne and Manuel Bilski.

In addition to works produced
by UC students and faculty, the
Review also publishes writings by
non-campus authors, both little-
known and famous. Works by
William Carlos Williams and Ni-

Review representative

"The Review is not hampered in
the selection of its material by a
rigid format,” stated "Chip” Kar-
matz, editor. "The divisions of the
Review, fiction, essay, poetry, and
book reviews are extremely plas-
tic and are not hampered by any
fixed quotas. The magazine at-
tempts to represent all kinds of
fiction and non-fiction cohering a
wide variety of subjects. Conse-
quently, there is no necessity to
pad the sections, as is the case
with many other publications. The
Review is free to discard any sec-
tion if there is not sufficient good

Islands, and every state in the
United States. Among the more
recent subscribers to the Review
is the library of San Quentin pris-
on in California.

Staff votes on manuscripts

“Works are chosen solely on the
basis of merit,” stated Karmatz.
“Although we consciously attempt
to act as a vehicle for the pub-
lication of good student work,
quality, not name of author, is
our only criterion for choosing
works for publication. Each one
of the twenty staff members has
the opportunity to vote upon
which manuscripts will -be pub-
lished and to voice his opinion
upon each of the works submitted.
To each manuscript is attached a
sheet of paper upon which the
staff write their criticisms, which
may be anything from a brief
philosophical dissertation on aes-
thetics to the terse comment, "No!
This one belongs in Jack and Jill!”

every aspect of the production of

If You Present Your ID Card at the BozoHke

by Warren Roy Spachner

Pleasantly warm nights, poorly lighted streets in the Uni-
versity neighborhood, and more people out on the streets at
night can mean only one thing — an increase in the crime rate.

The warm weather brings out not only the decent citizens
who are merely after a little fresh air but also the hoodlums
or gansters looking for some easy money.

These hoodlums specialize
in street crimes (assault, rob-
beries, rapes, auto and bicycle
thefts and the like). These
"hoods” usually operate in the
darker, morb poorly lit streets be-
cause it is easier to hide there.

Their victims or intended vic-
tims are usually people who are
out walking by themselves. But
if a gang of “hoods” is large
enough they might even attack
a group.

Statistics show that these hood-
lums range in age from 14 to 18.
They very seldom operate alone
but usually in gangs of from three
to six members. These gangs can-
not be said to be either predomin-
antly white or predominantly col-
ored. When armed, they carry
some kind of a club or blackjack,
knives, and sometimes they carry
guns. The blackjacks are usually
either lead pipes or socks filled
with something heavy like gravel.

Light-meter readings taken in

various parts of Ch’cago point up
the fact that street lighting in the
University area is some of the
poorest to be found anywhere in
Chicago. The Midway, 59th and
60th streets are the most poorly
lit of all.

Until such time as improve-
ments occur, Tony Eidsen, chief
of the campus police, suggests
that students pay attention to
safety precautions. “Do not walk
the streets alone at night. If you
must cross the Midway, cross only
streets like Woodlawn or Ellis
which are lighted and patrolled.
Do not use, except.at your own
risk, the cross walks between
these streets.

“If you must go out at night be
sure to tell someone that you are
going out, how long you expect to
be gone, and if possible, where
you are going. Most important of
all, do not carry large sums of
money with you. Carry only what
is necessary.”

ers, is best equipped to represent
our students and bring them
NSA’s benefits all year, rather
than merely to contribute to mak-
ing the summer Congress more
lively by protests about the world
situation.”

Continuing ISL's po 'J n that
the party’s previous i Jences
in former congresses entitles it
to reelection, Monica Kazasa em-
phasized the role of the UC delega-
tion at the convention. She said:

“I believe that the most impor-
tant issue in the NSA election
campaign is the effectiveness of
the UC delegation to the NSA
Congress this summer. Both par-
ties would support a liberal pro-
gram. However, since ISL dele-
gates have had experience at the
NSA Congresses for five years
and are active leaders in the Asso-
ciation, they would be able to
work vigorously and effectively
for the adoptio of their program.”

On the other side, SRP candi-
date Karl Rodman emphasized the
contribution of the two political
groups to the academic freedom
week activities. In expressing his
personal qualifications for elec-
tion, Rodman stated;

“My personal qualification for
election is close contact with NSA
activities in the field of academic
freedom, having been chairman of
Chicago’s Academic Freedom
Week and NSA’s regional aca-
demic freedom sub-ccmmission.

“The SRP delegat.on has pre-
pared to take with them a com-
plete record of Chicago’s academic
freedom activities and will work
to have NSA sponsor a truly na-
tional week in 1955. *

“If the campus feels that last
week’s activities were worthwhile,
they should send a delegation
which worked on and is well
acquainted with all' aspects of
our week, rather than one which

consistently deprecated it
‘maningless’ and took no part
the activities whatsoever.”

CONTINENTAL

as
in

Another issue which SRP can-
didates consider important was
brought out by Dick Ward, an
independent running w it h SRP
backing. He centered his argu-
ment on the party platform deal-
ing with the exchange of students
with other countries. He noted the
failure of sue ha program al last
year’s congress:

"I believe thatone of the most
important issues of this campaign
is that of international student
exchange. Both parties have stat-
ed that they are in favor of stu-
dent exchange with ‘all’ countries.
Last year a resolution reaffirm-
ing this principle failed the NSA
Congress by only seven votes. The
objectors to this resolution op-
posed it mainly on the basis that
it was impossible to travel be-
tween such nations as the US
and Soviet Union. My recent trip
to the USSR has essentially re-
futed these arguments.

“It now seems logical to me for
the NSA to invite a group of So-
viet students to this country and
also to explore the possibilities of
widening student contact with the
USSR. This would be a very posi-
tive step for decreasing present
day international tensions.”

Jan Metros chose to speak for
ISL on the same topic of interna-
tional exchange of students. She
outlined her position on her quali-
fications by noting her previous
work in organizations dedicated
to this and other problems and in
her experience in SG. She told the
MAROON that:

“I feel that it is important to
have a transmission of ideas With
students throughout this country.
NSA is a body which can accom-
plish this. I am very interested in
two points of my platform: Fair
Educational Practices Act and the
foreign exchange program and
have worked in various organiza-
tions whose main purpose was to
work for these points. If elected
I will do my best to further the
ideals set forth by these in the

convention. After working in the
government for a year and seeing
both parties operate, I know that
ISL is better equipped to put its
platform, which I back, into ac-
tion and for this reason I choose
to run on the ISL ticket.”

Larry Lichtenstein, SRP candi-
date, limited his statement to an
explanation of his abilities as a
candidate. He went on to discuss
the duties of a student to his so-

ciety and the dangers to
mocracy:

‘‘My interest in student
is an unusual thing. It is
with what I consider to
role as a student and as a

our de-

politics
tied up
be my
citizen.

I have taken from this society and
its educational system and I feel
bound to give back to it in what
ways I am able. I am deeply dis-
turbed by the current trends in
American education and the
threat these present to democracy
—the democracy which has to a
very real extent created me.

“What I want to do is fight this
danger. I have had some experi-
ence as a NSA delegate last year
and two years in Student Govern-
ment. My chief abilities, however,
lie simply in the fact that I am
a student and a citizen.”

This election has also produced
an independent candidate. Phillip
Wyatt has stated that in running
as an independent candidate, he
has freed himself from the con-
fines of party discipline and party
machinery. He further explains
his views on UMT, the Michigan
Plan, foreign exchange, and eco-
nomic burdens of students. He
said:

“I choose to enter the race for
national delegate as an independ-
ent candidate for three reasons:
1) I believe that my views on the
important issues at stake will bet-
ter represent the average UC stu-
dent at the NSA convention than
those of a regimented party mem-
ber. 2) I do not like to sit by
placidly as machine politics at-
tempt to intimidate a student
body. 3 > Our campus needs more

Paul Robeson to appear in Mandel

Paul Robeson, the widely acclaimed Negro actor and basso will present a concert of art songs, arias, folk
songs, hymns and spirituals May 8, at 8:30 p.m. in Mandel Hall. His final program has not yet been an-
nounced.

Class valedictorian and Phi Betta Kappa at Rutgers, besides being a 4-letter man and twice an All-

American end, Robeson
started at the Columbia
Law School, but became in-
terested in dramatics and
finally starred in a revival of
O’Neill’s “Emperor Jones.” When
Jones is lost in the jungle he is
supposed to whistle to keep up his
spirits. Robeson’s whistling appar-
ently left something to be desired,
so he sang instead, and was so
successful that only two years lat-
er he made his first concert ap-
pearance in Greenwich Village,

N. Y.

A long line of successes fol-
lowed in America, England and
Europe, and have continued
ever since, along with stage
performances, particularly in
“Othello,” and USO tours. Re-
cently, however, he has been re-
stricted from performing in
many places and has been de-
nied a passport because of his
views.

Lawrence Brown, accompanist
for Robeson for many years, stud-
ied music in Boston, and later
went to London where he studied

composition with Alec Rowley and
Miss Ira Aldridge. He toured with
Roland Hayes for four years in
England and on the continent, and
joined Robeson in 1925, accom-
panying him in his first recital
and in concerts ever since.

Brown is well known for his
research in Negro music, and
for his numerous arrangements,
such as “Joshua Fit de Battle of
Jericho,” “Steal Away,’.’ “Swing
Low, Sweet Chariot,” “Li’l Dav-
id” and “Ezekiel Saw de Wheel.”

According to a spokesman for
the Student Representative Party,

which is sponsoring the concert,
“The only basis on which we
should decide Robeson’s appear-
ance here, in a respected concert
hall, should be that of his undis-
puted artistic excellence. Robeson
is coming here to sing, not to give
a political lecture. We do not be-
lieve that McCarthyism should be
allowed to tell us what artists we
can hear and appreciate.”

Tickets, pric<“d at $1 general
admission and $1.50, reserved
seats are available at the SG

conditions, can be heard through-

what their goals are.

Joel Seidman, assistant pro-
fessor of social science at UC,
has written a history of the
war-time and reconversion role
of labor, “American Labor from
Defense to Reconversion, which
offers an interesting chronologi-
cal account of government labor
policy and the activities of un-
ions from pre-war defense mo-
bilization to the passage of the
Taft-Hartley Act. Professor
Seidman’s book is of particular
interest to those who have form-
ed their impressions of that
period through the press of
more recent years.

Labor, on the basis of Profes-
sor Seidman’s evidence, can hard-
ly be said to have made earth-
shaking advances during the pe-
riod covered. Such governmental
decisions as the “Little Steel” for-
mula, at best kept wages close to
rising prices, rather than using
the favorable war-time situation
to significantly improve the fu-
ture position of workingmen.Such
wartime innovations as FECP,
were junked at the conclusion of
the crisis by a Congress which
apparently conceived of the four

freedoms as mere tools to be used
in advancing foreign policy.

Seidman is a dull writer; one
soon tires of his frequent use
of such constructions as “part-
ly because . . . and partly be-
cause.” Often, he refers to some-
thing called “public opinion”
which is described as holding a
specific viewpoint. Exactly how
this was determined is not men-
tioned, nor is there any ade-
quate discussion of the relative
importance of labor and man-
agement biases in the report-
ing of the issues to the public,
which would seem essential if
“public opinion” is to be an im-
portant factor in the settlement
of industrial disputes, as Seid-
man feels it is.

From Seidman’s account oge re-
ceives the impression of a tre-
mendously influential and mili-
tant anti-unionism, continuing in
intensity throughout the war and
affecting not only employers, but
at times governmental officials of
considerable importance, a picture
varying widely from the common
conception of that era in popular
media. The Taft-Hartley Act,
which is briefly treated, is, Seid-

man feels,, the outcome of a long
fight to control and destroy the
labor movement. He feels that the
behavior of labor leaders of the
John L. Lewis type “helped form
the climate of opinion in which
the Taft-Hartley Act was pos-
sible.” One wonders whether this
is not giving too much credence
to the rationalizations of support-
ers of the act, who would probably
magnify even the most innocuous
actions of labor leaders into na-
tional calamities worthy of imme-
diate solution by restrictive legis-
lation.

There are few original formu-
lations or insights into the labor
problems of a democratic so-
ciety in Seidman’s book, but it
is a most competent account of
the specific issues of the de-
fense crisis. Many of the prob-
lems suggested in the work are,
to this reviewer, insoluble ex-
cept within a broad political
framework, a fact which Mc-
Carthyism if nothing else,
should daily demonstrate t o
unionists and liberals, who are
the ultimate targets of its at-
tack. •

Edna St. \ incent Millay’s Aria da Capo, Box and Cox, and The Shy and Lonely by Irwin
Shaw make up the three-point program. Two new direetprs are being introduced to UT
audiences. Eddie Simmons, who acted last season with the Showcase Theater of Evanston, is
directing The Shy and Lonely,

and Barry Sherman, seen last
quarter as Shawn in the UT
production of Playboy, is direct-
ing Aria da Capo.

The play offers a diversity of
styles, including the farce and
•parody of Box and Cox, a sample
of poetic “license” in Aria da
Capo, and the contemporary real-
ism of Irwin Shaw.

Aria da ( apo was written by
Edna St. Vincent Millay for the
Provincetown Players. The
story, a counterbalancing of su-
perficiality and allegorical val-
ues, is offered in a play-wit hin-
a play form. The pastel, Wat-
teau-like figures of Pierrot and
Columbine serve as a contrast-
ing frame-work for the mock-
simple story of a game of life
that soon grows too serious. Of
several dramatic works by poet-
ess Millay, Aria da Capo has
had the most success.

Box and Cox, the perennial Brit-
ish farce, may be remembered by
some as it was presented by UT in
1947 with the Hibbs and Reifler
team of Reno gambling fame. The
play, now in its second century as
a favorite curtain-raiser and inter-
lude piece, is considered the one
drama classic to come out of Eng-
land in the nineteenth certtury.
Gilbert and Sullivan added a musi-
cal score to John Morton's piece
and turned it into Cox and Box, in
which form it has been a long-
standing success in the repertory
of the D’oyly Carte company. In
sty le and language the play was
probably a model for Wilde’s Im-

Irwin Shaw won a reputation
as one of America’s most prom-
ising playwrights with his
dramas The Gentle People and
Bury the Dead. Since the 1940s,

a quartet by Rossini and "Trois pieces breves" by Ibert. The group was

Oberlin choir brightens Mandel hall

A good college choir is almost as rare (present company excepted) as a dry April in Chicago, and it was
refreshing to hear the Oberlin Choir's concert last Monday, which seemed about as good as one could wish.
Conducted by Robert Fountain, they sing with excellent intonation and a precision which would do credit to

any professional group.

Since the tour came
during Holy Week, the
program was almost entirely
sacred, and mostly from the
sixteenth century. However it was
well chosen and included among
others the “Agnus Dei” of Thomas
Morley, with an interesting pedal
point near the end, and J very

The program closed, however,
with three negro spirituals:
“Were you there,” “Mary wore
three links of chain” and “Ezekiel
saw de wheel,” which were sung
exceptionally well and with much
spirit. The singing of Richard
Bowles, who also sang the tenor
solo in the Cantata, and Marvyne
Betsch is to be commended.

About the only lapses in the
program were the Bach and the
Brahms, which was sung a bit
apathetically, particularly what
was described in the program
notes as the “vigorous third
movement”; however this may
have been the effects of the
tour, and certainly the spirit-
uals and the lively and charm-

ing “Petit Nymphe Folatre” of
Francois Regnard were done
with plenty of spirit. In general,
although the program some-
what resembled a church serv-
ice, the music was excellently
performed, and the Student Un-
ion Club committee may be
complimented on a fine choice.

tured a small orchestra composed
of strings, oboes and piano. Un-
fortunately it was performed in
almost the same character as the

formidable array of orchestral instruments recruited from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

mained unchanged after the
Reformation. The text appar-
ently caused the composer some
trouble. The choice of the St. John
version is strange, unless Bach
was specifically directed to it, for
as a whole the libretto is poorly
constructed and lacking in dra-
matic effect, and its two parts are
unbalanced.

The textual deficiencies were
rather noticeable in the UC
choir's performance, and seem-
ed to be aggravated by poor
translations. The music, how-
ever, is some of Bach’s best,

Certain sections reach high dra-
matic peaks; for instance the cries
of the people to crucify Jesus.
Here again, however, the text seri-
ously hampers the effect, for as
beautiful as is the music, there is
no progression, and the climaxes
are isolated and ineffective.

The tenor, who played the ex-
tensive part of the Evangelist,
John Toms, must be particular-
ly congratulated on his execu-
tion of a great number of recita-
tives and a few very moving

and Bernard Izzo, baritone, were
also excellent, but the other
soloists were only adequate, and
the soprano less than thaL The
solos of Florian Mueller and
Jerry Sirucek, the oboes, and
Julius Klein, the viola da gam-

The choir acquitted itself credit-
ably, with only minor mishaps, ex-
cept that some of the choruses,
such as the first and the one deal-
ing with the rending of the cloak,
which have an insistent rhythmic

pattern, were mechanically per-
formed. We may look forward to

THE CHICAGO MAROON

April 23, 1954

Sailors get
fourth place
as boats fall

by Al Fortier

Amid a flurry of capsizings,
the UC sailing team manged
to keep enough above water to
finish fourth out of five at the
University of Michigan last week-
end in its first regatta of the
season. Of the ten top teams
scheduled to compete, only five
showed up. Michigan beat out
Michigan State for the top berth,
followed by Wisconsin, UC, and
Detroit.

The meet, marked by chilly
weather and moderately high,
gusty winds, saw four boats cap-
size in the chilly water. Shortly
after storm sails were bent on
as a safety measure, Wisconsin's
team capsized. Just before the
start of the next race Ells McClen-
achan continued the tradition of
Chicago Commodores, and splash-
ed into the lake with Crew Dotty
Hess.

Detroit topples twice

Detroit, not to be outdone by
the Windy City crew, promptly-
capsized twice. Meanwhile Bob
Baron managed to keep his tender
DT dinghy on top of the water
to keep the UC team out of last
place in the top event of the sea-
son.

Tomorrow the Midway Mari-
ners play host to local rivals IIT
and Northwestern at Columbia
Yacht Club for the Illinois State
championship. This will be the
first home event of the three
teams this season. With North-
western rumored to be using
freshmen and IIT little better
than last season, when Chicago
beat them in both contests, the
UCers look like a good bet to win.

Others capsize . . .

. . . but not these hardy UC sail-
ors. They managed to guide their
craft through the wavy water at
Ann Arbor, Michigan, to place
fourth. However, shortly after
this picture wras taken, two crew-
men, Ellis McClenachen and Dotty
Hess slid off the slippery deck
into the chilly- water.

Intramural play at peak;
playoff games next week

by Spike Pinney

This week marks about the middle of spring intramural play; volleyball is ending, soft-
ball began yesterday; and golf and tennis play are scheduled to start soon.

Teams representing college, divisional, and fraternity houses had their first opportunity
to flex their muscles when volleyball play began in early April. Games in three leagues
went on almost every afternoon upstairs in Bartlett.

Mothews clinches first

League standings with two
place in the college league and
Beecher first in the divisional
circuit. Running behind Math-
ews, 14-1 record were Coulter,
12-3; Mead, 10-5; and Linn, 5-10.
Vincent and Salisbury also played.
The three teams following Beech-
er’s 13-2 high w'ere Hitchcock and
the Divinity School with identical
9-3 records; and Argonne Hospi-
tal, 5-7.

Today is the final day of play,
and next Tuesday Mathews and
the divisional champs will stage a
playoff. Winner of this game will
meet the fraternity house leader
in a glittering all-Midway intra-
mural volleyball championship
game.

Psi U leading frats

Fraternity standings with two
days of play to go indicated that

days of competition remaining

Psi U would repeat in that league.
Behind their 11-1 mark came Phi
Sigma Delta, 10-2; Phi Gamma
Delta, 84; and ZBT, 7-5. Next
Thursday w-ill see the playoff be-
tween the final leader here and
the college-divisional playoff win-
ner.

Volleyball players switch to
softball in the three intramural
leagues from this week until late
in May. Games will be played on
north field and the field behind
BJ up until May 20. Anyone wish-
ing to officiate at games should
report to intramural director Koo-
man Boycheff at Bartlett. A gen-
erous fee is offered for compe-
tent umpiring.

lar league tennis similar to volley-
ball and softball will begin next
week. In this competition each
house will be represented by two
players. In matches they will op-
pose the other team in singles
first, and, if the two teams split,
in doubles to decide the match.
The other type of competition is
strictly individual medalist tour-
nament play. So far eleven men
have signed up for the tourna-
ment singles play, and four teams
for the doubles competition. Boy-
cheff is hoping for more doubles
entries in the tournament which
begins next week. All faculty
members, employees, and students
of the University are eligible.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Page 11

iXrXmZMaroons w'n f'rst game

JV trackmen also faced the
water test Wednesday and
trod through the mud to edge
state champions LaGrange and
city champions Wendell Phillips.
Final score was Chicago 51%,
LaGrange 50% and Phillips 46.

Dick Scupi won the mile and
Chuck Youse the shot-put for the
only clean cut Chicago victories,
but the Maroons, especially Mitch
Watkins, piled up points by plac-
ing second or third in almost
every event they didn’t win.

Jim Brown set a new JV record
of :51.5 as he finished third in
the 440. Watkins was high scorer
for the meet with 11% points.

Last Thursday, April 15, Wat-
kins was held to a mere 21%
points as the JV team downed
Tilden Tech and Du Sable High
schools. Score was Chicago 85%,
Tilden 46% and Du Sable 16.

Other lightweight winners were
Youse on the shot, Brown in the
440, and Lynn Small in the 100,
220 and the shot-put. Small, run-
ning with Chernoff, Bill Mitchell
and Brown, turned in a scorching
anchor leg to snatch victory from
a speedy Tilden quartet.

Sports Briefs

Hetmen tumble teachers

but then the roof falls in

by Leonard Friedman

The Maroons snapped a three-game losing streak last Friday as they downed Chicago
Teachers, 10-5, on the diamond at Stagg Field. But at Milliken College on Tuesday they
were soundly trounced, 17-6.

Poor fielding consistently hampered Maroon chances for victory as Milliken pulled ahead
to an early 7-0 lead off starter John Broyles and piled up a commanding lead over reliever
Jerry Bowman.

Bab Mann’s bases-loaded homer and a two-run double drove in all the Maroon tallies and

proved to be the high point of Maroon slugging for the day. Pitching was steady and as
usual iron-man Walt Walker-------------------

had a fine day behind the
plate.

Tarr leads Maroons

Relieving and starring in a four-
inning stint against Chicago
Teachers, Buzz Tarr finally coral-
led the first varsity victory. The
win was also sparked by solid hit-
ting and smart baserunning be-
hind the two-hit, no run perform-
ance of Tarr. Tarr, a veteran from
last year’s squad, exhibited fine
control and with a tight infield
proved invincible on the mound.

Jerry Bohman started for the
team and was rapped for five
quick runs, mainly due to a re-

lapse on the part of Maroon field-
ers. Five strikeouts helped Boh-
man stem the rally and hold Chi-
cago Teachers to only those five
initial runs.

Errors help Maroon rally

Varsity stickmen went to work
in the fourth inning—helped also
by the errorful ball played by Chi-
cago Teachers. George Grey and
Gil Levine reached the bases via
errors. Don Mazukelli followed
with' a hit that scored Grey, and
he and Levine were promptly
brought around on a long triple
by third-sacker Al Binford. On a
ground ball by Bohman, Binford
scored the fourth run of the in-
ning.

The Maroons pulled ahead in
the fifth inning through heads-up
base-running and timely hitting
by Makukelli and Bob Mann. Al-
ditional runs were scored in the
sixth and seventh innings.

Tarr opened the sixth with a
base hit. Walt Walker doubled
and scored Tarr. Performing in
the same fashion team captain
Dave Utley belted a base hit and
brought Walker in with the sec-
ond run of the inning. Three
straight hits by Binford Tarr and
Walker piled up the final runs
in the ten run Maroon total.

Coach Anderson was in a chip-
per mood as he left the field and

he thought that Tarr would
strong asset in the coming
paign. Anderson appears to
finally worked the team

be a
cam-
have
into

shape and produced a winning
combination.

against Illinois Tech at Stagg
Field tomorrow at 3:30.

for eleventh straight win

Chicago Teachers fell before the onslaught of the Maroon netmen
last Friday on the varsity courts, 8-1. This was the third straight win
for the UC tennis squad this spring and their eleventh straight if
last season’s games are included.

Chuck Werner, Duncan Burford, Gerard Ledermann, Rene Mont-
joie and Toby Owen had no trouble winning their matches while the
doubles teams of Werner-Burford, George Stone-Owen and Montjoie-
Ledermann slammed the doubles matches.

The JV netmen open their season this afternoon against Chicago
Latin. Monday they return home to face Harvard on the varsity
courts at 3:30 p.m.

Bowlers fall; pins don't in meet

Maroon trackmen knock down records, Wendell Marumoto knocks
down opposing pitchers, but the UC bowling team didn’t knock down
enough pins Monday evening and they wound up where bad bowlers
wind up—buying the beers in the fifth frame. The four-man team
bowled a 20-game total of 2898 (an average of slightly less than 145
per man) against the “B” competition in the First Annual National
Intercollegiate Telegraphic Bowling Tournament sponsored by the
American College Unions Association. (Whew!)

The team selected last quarter in try-outs sponsored by Student
Union consisted of Glenn Hoffman, high scorer with a 636 series,
Bill Mosher, Chuck Mulbrandon and Ted Gray. The final results and
standards won’t be known until next week. The poor showing made
by the newly-formed bowling club was their first and only showing
of the 1953-54 season.

Pros sand-trap varsity golfers

Like Little Red Hiding Hood who went through the woods to grand-
mother’s house, the varsity golfers took the wrong path last Satur-
day. The divot-makers learned that the shortest way from the first
tee to the eighteenth hole of the Cog Hill course is not through the
foliage, but on the fairways, the route taken by Illinois Professional
Schools who won the match 10-8. Bison shot a two over par 76, while
Bob Kelso followed with 82 for the best Maroon showings.

After facing St. Joseph at Cog Hill yesterday the golfers travel to
Beechwood Country Club in La Porte, Indiana to face Valparaiso
tomorrow. The JV golfers open the season against Hyde Park at
Jackson Park this afternoon.

Chicago chess team wins again

In a somewhat delayed match, the Chicago chess teaqi defeated
Wright Junior College, 3-2. Playing four games Friday and one
Tuesday, the UCers face a Wright team which threw their strongest
players against the Maroon’s weaker members, but Chuck Hennen
and Larry Abrahams managed to win and Burt Weinstein and Joel
Kupperman pulled draws. Mort Shapiro was the lone UC loser. The
Chicago chess-men are currently leading the Chicago Intercollegiate
Chess League with two wins and one draw.

Sports events this week

Tomorrow—Varsity fencers face stern competition in the Illinois
Division Amateur Fencing League of America matches in Bartlett
Gym at l:3|^and 7 p.m. The Maroon baseballers will face Illinois Tech
at 2 p.m. in Stagg Field. Monday—the JV tennis team will meet
Harvard school at 3:30 p.m. on the Varsity courts. Thursday—the
JV trackmen run against Mt. Carmel High School at Stagg Field at
3:30 p.m.

Maroon shortstop, Wendell
Marumoto, is looking forward to
a successful season with the
Maroon diamondeers. Maru-
moto, whose swift baserunning
has tumbled many a player 30
or 40 pounds heavier, hails from
Honolulu, Hawaii, and is a
member of Psi Upsilon frater-
nity. This is his second year on
the varsity squad.

PAC opposes
two referenda

Opposition to at least two of the
five propositions on the National
Student Association ballot was
voted by the executive committee
of the new Political Action Com-
mittee (PAC) at an open meeting
Wednesday night.

Ralph D. Fertig, temporary
PAC chairman, said that the
group is “definitely opposed” to
electing five members at large to
the Student Assembly and to the
removal of executive officers of
Student Government through the
initiative of the SG president.

PAC favors amending the term
of the Student-Faculty-Adminis-
tration Court and supports the
idea of filling vacancies in SG on
a party basis. The committee took
no immediate stand on a fifth
proposition, concerning by-elec-
tions for SG.

these practices. We’d rather have

Normality redefined

At Oklahoma City University a
coed sought help in the classified
ad columns of her school’s news-
paper in an attempt to retrieve
some lost articles. Among the
items were two mechanical pen-
cils, a purple formal, one shoe, a
$3 check, a pajama bottom, a suit
of long underwear and a white
shirt. “It’s normal for a girl to

'Run-for-fun' boys
face water test, win
twice by large leads

by Justin Johnson and Spike Pinney

Running in Saturday’s sunshine and Wednesday s rhud and
rain, the varsity track team sped to victory over Washington
University (St. Louis) and Wilson Junior College. The “run
for fun” boys coasted to victory over Washington, 80 2/3 -
50 1/3 and gained an even easier triumph as they swam
through the mud and water that formed the Stagg Field track

Wednesday to down Wilson,
ioiy2-2oy2.

Frank Loomos, still running
with a game leg, won the 100 yard
dash and the 220 low hurdles to
tie with Phil Wyatt for high scor-
er Wednesday. Wyatt won the 220
and 440 yard dashes. The Maroons
lost only one event as mud-spat-
tered winner after mud-spattered
winner came off the water logged
track to seek the shelter of the
Stagg Field stands.

Trifone gets two firsts

Dan Trifone took the 120 yard
high-hurdles and was followed to
the wire by Sherry Gray and John
Lathrop. Trifone also tied for first
in the high jump with Bob Mason
and Paul Baptist. A four-way tie
in the pole vault was recorded as
Baptist and Ken Stapley leapt 10
feet along with two Wilson track-
ment.

In the field events, Joe Howard,
Roger Forsyth and Clive Gray
swept the shot put for Chicago.
Howard’s toss was 42 feet. For-
syth and Gray were joined by
Larry Shaderowsky in a sweep of
the discus, with Forsyth throwing
the metal plate 119'7".

Relay team swims to tope

Art Omohundro took the mile
in 4:37.2 and Arnie Meardon won
the 880 yard run. Chicago took an-
other sweep in the two mile as
Ray Sanders, Palmer Pinney and
Jim Flynn placed one, two, three.
The mile relay team set a new

golf like that in tennis has attract-
ed four entrants at this time.
These four and any others who
apply will tee off on the Jackson
Park course on May 7. As with
tennis, the winner will be award-
ed a handsome medal signifying
his success. A third tournament,
horseshoes, had been planned, but
since only one student signed up,
Boycheff canceled the tourney
and had to put his horseshoe
medal back in the drawer until
next year. .

swimming record as they splashed
to a slow victory.

Water also featured in the meet
Saturday against Washington uni-
versity, but in this instance it was
a water fight in the Field-House
locker room after the game. Evi-
dently, the St. Louis runners did-
n’t provide enough competition
for the Maroon speedsters so
Walt Deike took after Sherry
Gray with a few water-soaked
towels. Within minutes the lock-
er-room was drenched and so were
Chicago trackmen.

Higdon and Loomos handled
the long and the short end for the
Maroons as Washington fell, 80
2/3-50 2/3. Each scored two vic-
tories, Higdon the mile and two-
mile, Loomos the 100 and 220
yard dashes.

Omohundro ran 2:02.7 to post
his first major win in the 880,
coming from behind on the last
straightaway to overhaul team-
mates Pinney and Meardon. Stap-
ley built up a big lead in the 440
and coasted to the tape, finishing
:51.5.

change—greater foreign exchange
leads to greater international un-
derstanding. Let us strive for a
larger student exchange program
with all countries not just the
Soviet Union. 4) The student whp
must work his way through col-
lege suffers greatly from the addi-
tional burden of taxes. The NSA
lobby in Washington must help us
introduce bills in congress to elim-
inate income tax on the earnings
of legitimate students while they
are working their way through
school.”

The MAROON has presented
the views of all candidates in the
upper five. At deadline time, there
was no statement available from
ISL candidate Bruce Larkin.

The views expressed are those
of the candidates and their par-
ties and do not reflect those of the
MAROON or its staff.
