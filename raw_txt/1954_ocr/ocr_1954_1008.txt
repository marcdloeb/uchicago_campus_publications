An estimated 150 residents of Burton-Judson courts were
stricken late Thursday night and Friday, September 30 and
October 1, with a form of food poisoning resulting from
causes as yet unknown. Twenty men were treated at the
student health service clinic and three were kept overnight
for observation. However, none were reported in serious con-

dition.

Dr. William Lester, of stu-
dent health, and Sarah Kishi-
moto, dietitian at B-J, both felt
that the link sausage served at
the noon meal Thursday was the
cause. A series of culture tests
were run on remnants of every-
thing served that day except the
sausage, which was completely
consumed.

“No Negligence”

Dr,. Lester, stating that the
“cause was not clearly establish-
ed." added, “We have looked into
the matter and are convinced that
there was no negligence on the
(kitchen* staff's part.”

Miss Kishimoto, expressing a
deep concern over the affair, stated
that she had personally handled
the preparation of the sausage
from the frozen food locker to

the serving tables due to the ab-
sence of one of the cooks, and has
been assured by the supplier,
Mickelberry company, that the
meat was fresh. She added, “I feel
very badly about the whole thing
and am grateful for the attitude
of the boys in this matter.”

“Will Look”

Arthur Kiendl, director of hous-
ing, said that in his experience,
“the food here is far above average
for institution cooking. While we
don’t as yet know the exact cause

The kitchen .

... in Burton-Judson, where the food was prepared that poisoned
over one hundred residents.

Everyone interested in becom-

various houses is invited to attend.
The IFC recommends that “any-
' one planning to join a house
should visit at least three frater-
nities before joining one.” Neither
visiting nor pledging to any house
obligates one to join it.

Boy and Cows-

Both Aid Store

A “city boy” wil turn farm
hand for one week only because
of a department store’s birthday.

As part of its 100th anniversary
celebration, Carson Pirie and
company is displaying live cattle
in its loop store during National
Dairy week and Tom Kapantais,
UC student, has applied for and
received a one-week job as a

of the sickness, we’ll continue to
look for it.”

A'.general consensus at BJ
showed that most of the boys felt
that the food was more than ade-
quate and some even thought that
too much was being served, espe-
cially at morning meals.

Tell Symptoms

The symptoms of the plague
ran as follows: early morning
nausea continuing through the

Vaughan-Williams
to lecture at Mandel

stable hand

for these cattle.

Six prize cattle and six prize

Center for

day and a highly sensitive
ach, which lasted in some
until Saturday.

Bill Kisken, one of the

stom-
cases

three

kept overnight at Billings re-
ported that he first felt sick at
about 1 a.m. Friday morning and
went to Billings hospital an hour
later. There he was given a seda-
tive and remained in bed until
1 p.m. on Saturday. Kisken stated,
“They took very good^care of me
and I got the best of treatment.”
More far reaching effects of
the blitz were noticed in a soc sci
section where the results of a test
were discounted because the class

Ralph Vaughan-Williams will
deliver the 191st Moody lecture
Thursday night at 8:30 in Man-
del Hall. Vaughan-Williams, one
of the most important compos-
ers of the twentieth century
and the dean and leader of con-
temporary British composers,
is currently a visiting profes-
sor at Cornell University.

The subject of his lecture is
“The background of music.”
Admission is without ticket
and without charge.

This is Vaughan - Williams’
first appearance on campus.
Stravinsky, Hindemith, and
Schoenberg have appeared
here previously.

average was abnormally low due
to the sickness, and in a physics
class where a test was discounted
due to low attendance.

Teacher Education

To Augment Teacher-Training

by Jack Burbach

Set Deadline

Only one week remains in which
to apply for Fulbright scholar-
ships for the academic year 1955-
56. Undergraduate and graduate
students interested in these schol-
arships for study in countries of
western Europe the middle east,
and Asia should apply to William
Birenbaum in the office of stu-
dent activities by next Friday.

calves belonging to the Curtiss
Candy company’s farms will be
on display at the store and Tom,
who comes from Chicago’s next
door neighbor, Hammond, Indi-
ana, will have the job of running
milking machines, feeding the
cattle, and wielding a shovel.

When asked if he had ever been
a stable hand before, Tom replied
that his experience was limited
to having seen cows once or twice
but that he thought he would
“make out all right” on the job.

Through the establishment of a center for teacher education, the University is inaugurat-
ing a series of steps designed to enable it to make a larger contribution to the preparation
of teachers in the secondary and elementary schools.

The center will assume the responsibility of coordinating all of the programs and activi-
ties related to the preparation of teachers.

The center will perform many of the functions carried on by schools of education at other
universities, but it will operate
in such a way as to make the
preparation of teachers for

Enrollment Figures Up

Enrollment in the college shows an increase of 13.6 per cent
over that of last fall, according to latest available figures. The
present number of college students is 1,283 as compared with
1,129 in October of 1953.

“Of the entering college students,” commented Dean Davey,
“106 out of 428 were not high school graduates, and 60 to 70
of them had attended other colleges.”

The old plan is being used by 505 of those in the colfege; 778
college students are registered in some phase of the new’ plan.
Of thse, 219 are working for a college AB, either in general
studies (with a year of tutorial work) or in social science, busi-
ness, pre-Iaw, or the graduate library school.

In addition 409 are entering into joint programs of college-
humanities leading to a BA, or of college- biological sciences or
college-physical sciences leading to a BS.

The remaining 67 new college students are early entrants or
students-at-Iarge.

The total quadrangle enrollment is 4,509, which shows an in-
crease of 16 persons over last fall's figure. This represents a
rise of approximately 0.4 per cent.

Total figures for the University are as yet incomplete because
there is still a week of registration remaining in the downtown
business school, according to the registrar’s office.

the elementary and secondary
schools a function of the entire
University.

Tell Purpose

The center will serve as a chan-
nel of communication to keep the
entire University aware of the
conditions prevailing in elemen-
tary and secondary education. It
will act to stimulate interest in
teacher preparation in the college
and the divisions of the Univer-
sity, and will provide channels
through which such efforts can be
effectively expressed. The center
will also assist the department of
education in improving its pro-
grams for professional operation.

Determine Needs

According to Francis S. Chase,
chairman of the department of
education, the center hopes to
work much more closely with the
personnel of the elementary and
secondary schools, to determine
with their aid the needs of teacher
education, and to bring to the
campus professional personnel
who will supplement our teacher
preparation program by the par-
ticular skills and knowledge
which they possess in their fields
of specialization.

The staff of the center will
consist of the faculty members in
the department of education and
a considerable number of faculty
members from the college and all
the graduate departments in the
divisions, under the general direc-
tions of the chairman of the de-
partment of education and the
council on teacher education.

To Use Research

The center will make full use
of the knowledge regarding the
learning process, child develop-

ment, and social behavior that are
represented in the various social
science departments, Chase said.
It will also tap the special knowl-
edge and insight gained by the
biological and physical sciences,
and will make use of the stand-
ards of value developed by the
humanities, he added.

The preparation of teachers for
the elementary and secondary
schools will thus become a re-
sponsibility and function of the
entire University, Chase said.

as many as you want. If we select yours,
we’ll pay $25 for the right to use it, together

Explain NSA’s

Near to Come

The National Student associa-
tion has planned its regional pro-
gram for the coming year on the
basis of its Illinois regional execu-
tive committee meeting held last
Saturday at Roosevelt university.

Lawrence Lichtenstein, vice-
president of the Illinois region,
stated that the program for the
coming year will center on exten-
sion of academic freedom week ac-
tivities, continuation of the fair
educational practices code, and in-
auguration of a newsletter to com-
municate ideas and events con-
cerning NSA to other schools in
the region of NSA.

At the executive committee
meeting, a regional planning cau-
cus was arranged, to meet at the
University of Illinois October 19-
21.

Attending the Roosevelt meet-
ing were UC students Bruce Lar-
kin, Lawrence Lichtenstein, and
Joel Rosenthal. They are, respec-
tively, president, vice-president,
and educational affairs vice-presi-
dent of the Illinois region of NSA.

Lichtenstein said that the Stu-
dent Government's NSA commit-
tee will need much help during
academic freedom week.

made him a star. His shows

the Ida Noyes library, under the
chairmanship of Virginia Bicker-

“All girls 16 years old or over
are eligible to rush,” explained
Ruth K o p e 1, Interclub council
president, “and most eligible girls
will receive invitations. However,
all are invited, even if they fail to
be notified personally.

“The tea is being held as an op-
portunity for new students to be-
come acquainted with club mem-
bers, and with the club system it-
self,” continued Miss Kopel. “And
we are hoping that a large num-
ber of girls will take' part in the
rushing activiites, whether or not
they expect to join a club.”

At present there are approxi-
mately 60 to 75 club members
who are registered on the cam-
pus. belonging to four groups:
Sigma, Delta Sigma. Quadrangler
and Mortarboard, and united un-
der the Interclub council.

Other activities during the two-
week rushing period include cof-
fee and coke dates with club mem-
bers, parties and the Preferential
dinner and dance. -

Hunt room, off the Commons,
has been reserved for coffee dates
from October 21 through 26. Club
members will invite prospective
r ibers there for individual
talks.

In addition, each club has ten-
tatively scheduled two evening
parties, which will probably be
held at fraternity houses.

The Preferential dinner and
dance, October 30, culminates the
rushing program with bidding for
new members.

O-Board orients

On reading your issue oi Octo-
ber 1, I was disturbed to find a
statement that SG had spent last
spring planning Orientation
week. T am sure the statement
was not meant to be purposefully
misleading. However. I would like
to correct any misconceptions
which the statement may have
caused.

Orientation week is planned and
coordinated by the Student Orien-
tation Board in the preceding
Spring quarter. Orientation Board
is a student organization whose
main function is to help new stu-
dents understand and appreciate
the University of Chicago. The
Board is well equipped to do this
since al) applicants to the Board
engage in a program of discus-
sions designed to provide them
with a fundamental knowledge of
the college and its administration.

Orientation Board members live
In the dormitories during O-Week
and are on hand to help at all
activities. A meeting is called in
the spring by the Dean of Stu-
dents in the college of all student
and administrative activities con-
cerned with tfae week’s activities
to make final plans and sugges-
tions. Orientation Board, while in-
dependent of SG, SU, and all
other organizations, always co-
operates closely with the campus
as a whole. Suggestions about the
Orientation Program are always
welcome from SG or other organi-
zations.

Jim Rosenblum
Chairman, Student
Orientation Board

SG Praise O-Board

To the editor of the MAROON:

The Student Government ap-
preciates the coverage that was
given in a page 3 article to SG’s
activities during Orientation
Week. However, the first five
lines of the article give a false im-
pression and should be corrected.

It is not the ease, and I did not
tell the MAROON reporter it was,
that SG “worked to prepare the
or ientation program of last week.”
Many student groups participated
in planning the week's activities,
the most directly concerned of
these being the Orientation Board.

SG was in charge of certain as-
pects of the orientation program,
and these it. expanded consider-
ably over previous years. Further,
to say that “SG provided orienta-
tion personnel to greet the new
students ... at the dormitories”
glosses over the fact that most of
the old students working in the
dorms during O Week were from
O-Board. SG added only three of
its own members to this force.

I would greatly appreciate it if
the MAROON would note these
clarifications.

Clive S. Gray,

President, Student Government

Explains SG
jurisdiction

As a member of the Student
Government, I want, to express
my pleasure about the action of
the Phi Delta Theta convention.
I think the results are ones which
Will please the vast majority of
people on the campus. I would,
however, like to comment on one
important statement made by Mr.
Hartzler, as quoted in the Maroon.

Mr. Hartzler said that the Stu-
dent Government had no author-
ity in this case and that the frater-
nities are responsible only to the
administration. It seems to me
that whether you want to think
of this power which the SG used
as a grant from the administra-
tion <Mr. Hartzler’s view', or as
as recognition by the administra-
tion of the proper powers of the
Student Government (my own
view ’; it ought to be obvious now
that the SG does have the
power in these cases, and that this
power is recognized by the admin-
istration.

This is shown clearly by admin-
istration action, first, in not ve-
toing the Michigan Plan when it
was first passed, second, in en-
tering into their present agree-
ment with the SG concerning en-
forcement; and finally, by vari-
ous statements made by the Chan-
cellor.

Maroon errs

When I was interviewed for the
article on “rahrahism” in last
week's Maroon, I gave a state-
ment or rather, a statement with
qualifications, which I thought re-
flected my views on the subject.

The statement appeared, but.
without any of the qualifications.
Contacting others whose state-
ments were also included, I dis-
covered that thev were accorded
similar treatment. Phrases of
their statements were also pulled
out of context. This sort of treat-
ment by your writers can only
discourage cooperation from
those interviewed.

My impression of the article is
almost too commonly voiced to
bother mentioning. Let it suffice
to say that the article was mis-
leading, inconclusive, and intend-
ed only to generate panic.

Finds football
gentleman's sport

The football controversy has
raised a great deal of verbal dust
on this campus. Many facets of
Ulis problem have been discussed:

its effect on the level of intellec-
tual activity on campus, on cul-
tural maturity, and on enrollment.
One aspect of the problem has
not vet been discussed. I refer to
the pleasures which attend a gen
tlemth on the day of a contest.

We must picture a lovely Sat-
urday afternoon in Autumn. The
sun is shining; it is crispy-cold;
there is perhaps a slight frost on
the ground. The gentleman puts
on his tweeds, fills his hip flask,
and goes to the stadium. In the
stadium he finds his friends, and

they sit in congenial groups to
view the spectacle.

We need not go into the virtues
of the game itself. Suffice it to
say that it may be very enjoyable.
At half-time and at intervals, he
is entertained by the school's
marching band and cheerleaders.
The whole afternoon is calculated
to raise one's muscle tone consid-
erably.

The cold, singing, and cheering,
and the general excitement will
combine to provide the gentleman
with appetite and zest with which
to eat heartily his evening meal
and to prepare for the,series of
victory parties which he will at-
tend that evening in fraternity
houses, dormitories, and other
central campus locations.

This whole complex of activi-
ties provides a healthy and whole-
some recreation for the student
who has spent the whole week
hard at work in badly ventilated
libraries, laboratories, and classes.

There is a problem. Some stu-
dents are not gentlemen and
might not indulge in this specta-
torship moderately. They might
allow the thoughts of football to
disengage their minds from their
more serious work during the
week. Or. even worse, they might
extend the excellent university
policy of wide student participa-
tion in athletics to mean that a
Student should join the team. This
is*not at all intended. It is better
that only the professional players
provided by some sort of athletic
scholarship fund be used for the
spectacle.

Club Hears Episcopal Bishop

UT Presents 'The Enchanted'

The Reverend Francis Burrill. newly appointed Bishop of
Chicago of the Episcopal church, spoke last Tuesday at a
meeting of the Canterbury club on the topic, “The religion in
university thinking.”

I Ie commented on what he called “too much relativity” in
the thinking of people today. He expressed his opinion that
people seem to have forgotten
the objectivity of God. To him,

people are too concerned with
overcoming the uncertainties of
life and forget that God is ever
present; they forget that with
true faith in God comes faith in
life on earth.

For that same reason, he be-
lieves, the United Nations will
fail to accomplish the goal it has
set out to attain. World peace can
never be accomplished by men
who supposedly meeting to settle
problems of the different coun-
tties. actually pay more attention
to getting the better of their
neighbors.

The UN would be an effective
medium to settle problems if the
men in it were pious. “The room
in the UN building set aside for
meditation is very seldom used,’’
he said.

Teach Uncertainty

The ideas of relativity and pas-
sive devoutness is partly the re-
sult of the Dewey philosophy in
education, Burrill believes. This is
a cause since it teaches that the
child should have everything
made easy for him. Everything
should be conformed to the child
and the child should not be expect-
ed to conform to much.

Ue said that education seems
to teach that there are many un-
certainties in life and that most
things are not true except in rela-
tion to specific other things. He
mentioned Huxley’s statement
that a person is not an adult un-
til he realizes that life is but an
unsure thing. “When you get to
believe this,” he said, “you will
not be an adult, but a thoroughly
confused person.”

Holds Tryouts for 15 Roles

“The Enchanted,” by Jean Giradoux, will be University Theater’s first production of the
year. The play, scheduled for the weekend of November 19, 20, and 21, is to be staged “in the
round” at the Reynolds club theatre.

Appearing originally in the 1930s under the title of “Intermezzo,” “The Enchanted” is a
fantasy about a small town which is invaded by a capricious ghost. The play’s basic conflict
of idealism and realism centers around a young lady schoolteacher who falls in love with the

Student Groups
Must Register

All student groups seeking rec-
ognition as student organizations
at the University of Chicago must
register in the student activities
office by Monday, October 18, un-

der the provisions of the statute
of the Student Government and
the code of student regulations.

To secure recognition, an organ-

tration forms issued by the activ-
ities office, and have ten or more
members who are Students in

John and Alan Lomax, former
directors of the Library of
Congress folk music section
describe Seeger as “the tall, thin
Yankee, who can make a banjo
weep like a willow and mourn like
a dove . . . one of America’s
unique musicians.” Seeger’s banjo
playing has its roots in the moun-
tains of Tennessee. In the late
thirties he embarked upon his ca-
reer, playing in such diverse
places as New York’s Washing-
ton Square and Chicago's Pump
Room. He has made records for
Decca with the Weavers, and now
records for Stimson and Folk-
ways.

Style Improvisational

Big Bill Broonzy’s blues guitar
improvisations come from the
city slums and the southern chain
gangs. His friend and tutor. Hud-
die (Leadbelly) Ledbettor, said he
“was born with the blues.”

In the tradition of blues guitar-
ists his style is improvisational.
Through years of association with
such artists as Jelly Roll Morton
and, Blind Lemon Jefferson the
easy rambling style he had in his
youth has acquired polish. He is
currently running a bar at 36th
and Cottage Grove in Chicago,
where he plays with a three-piece
blues combo. Monday nights
Broonzy appears at the Blue
Angel with Studs Terkel and ban-
joist Fleming Brown.

Plays Blues

Sonny Terry hails from Dur-
ham, North Carolina. He plays
the blues harmonica in an ex-
tremely unusual way. Terry ob-
tains half steps without a chro-
matic harmonica. One of Amer-
ica’s leading harmonica players,
Terry appeared with Seeger in
the movie To Hear My Banjo
Play.

The concert is being held as a
benefit to cover the UC NSA dele-
gates’ expenses.

Offer Delegates' NS A Reports

Ames Atmosphere Tense;
Any Minority Suspected

By Lawrence Lichtenstein

This summer at Ames over 700 students from all over America
held a congress which lasted for ten days and which purported to
represent the students of this country. Who were these delegates, why
were they at Ames; in what atmosphere did the meeting take place;
and, what did it accomplish?

The delegates were mainly upperclassmen, some few graduate
students, and a sprinkling of younger people. They came from all
size campuses; some were fraternity men; many were students of
small catholic schools. There were students from City College of New
York and from Rockford College. Most of the delegates were serious;
they were interested in one way or another in student affairs. Some
wanted to run better student governments and some wanted student
exchange between all the nations of the world. Thinking was done in
terms of campus clubs all the way up to the nebulous concept of a

student community of the world.
It cannot be said that these were
shallow or “political” people; or
that they were naive or unpre-
pared.

Yet with all this diversity the
atmosphere of the congress was
surprisingly tense. There was a
fairly good consensus that the
controversial was to be left alone.
A minority, any minority, was
somehow suspect. And there were
certain issues which the leader-
ship had decided must not be
acted upon positively. East West
exchange between students was a
case of this sort. All kinds of argu-
ments were used against it save
the true one; that to have the
NSA favor student cooperation,
even in principle, with the iron
curtain countries was too contro-
versial for the organization to do
safely. There was, then, this trend
in the congress—that no definite
stands were to be taken on con-
troversial subjects. And for this
reason there were too many vague
and ambiguous statements; too
much “investigation” and “refer-
ral.”

This atmosphere led to a side-
stepping of many issues. The prob-
lem of segregation in education
was not acted upon all the way
through the sub-commission and
commission sessions, save for a
congratulatory telegram.

It was left for a southern region
to protest this in a highly un-par-
liamentry move. After the protest
an excellent report was drawn up,
but by only a committee of nine
for the whole congress. It was
read, and passed unanimously,
with something of awe, due to its
dramatic presentation.

The report on segregation can
illustrate clearly another attribute
of the congress atmosphere. There
was a distinct pressure to think
alike, and opinions ran like waves
over the assembled delegates.

After the report was read, a
delegate arose, first praising the
report, then going on to make a
constructive amendment. But this
student was hissed from the floor
by a congress who did not want
their document touched.

But despite this atmosphere
which generally prevailed, some
positive work was done. The
segregation report was of great
importance, and the declaration
of a national academic freedom
week will help safeguard that
right.

NSA pledged to wage a more
systematic fight against discrimi-
nation in education. There were
the many service projects im-
proved, such as the international
travel service and the institution
of a sub-commission which will
help student cooperatives to get
a start.

The Congress thus had its good
points and its bad points. In gen-
eral. I feel that it did not show
progress as it should have; and
I was extremely worried by the
atmosphere described above. Why
this atmosphere was present is
not hard to understand. It had two
basest?), one on the part of the
leadership, and one on the part of
the delegates themselves. The
leadership of NSA is a paid group
of officers and a small bureaucra-
cy under them. These people were
afraid for NSA.

NSA has previously come out
against any form of UMT; it has
said that anyone academically
qualified may teach; it has said

Soviet Exchange

Views Civen

By Richard Ward

One of the major disagreements between the
proponents and opponents of the proposal for stu-
dent exchange between the US and Soviet Union
was whether the National Student association was
the aopropriate organization to handle such an
exchange program.

The question was raised at the congress why
the Soviet Union and communist nations should
be singled out for specific exchange program.
However, NSA has in the past sent persons to
either particular nations or area of the world, but
in recent years never to communist nations.

It was logical that NSA explore the possibilities
of exchange programs since past NSA congresses
had endorsed the principle of exchange of students
with all nations as a means of furthering interna-
tional understanding.

The position of the proponents of the Soviet
exchange program took the position that students
have a duty to work for international understand-
ing and peace; and one of the means to these ends
would be a student exchange program.

The renewed possibilities for contact between
the US and Soviet Union and other communist na-
tions have been suggested by the ever-growing
number of American student groups that have
visited the Soviet Union in the past year.

At the NSA congress in the summer of 1953, it
was argued by opponents of the exchange program
with the communist nations that it was impossible
to travel in the Soviet Union because Soviet visas
could not be secured. It is now relatively easy for
American student groups to obtain Soviet visas.
Two more groups of US students were touring
the USSR this summer while the NSA congress
was in session.

Almost without exception all the US students
who have recently visited the USSR have urged
further student contact between the two coun-
tries. None have spoken against such exchanges.

Yet, it was argued that while communication
was necessary between the US and Soviet Union,
that student exchanges—the recent trips by US
students to the USSR—established no communica-
tion.

That the thousands of Soviet students who came
in contact with the American students who visited
their country turned completely deaf ears to their
visitors seems very improbable.

This notion was completely disproven when dur-
ing this summer two separate groups of Soviet
students requested visas to visit the US. One group
wanted to visit US schools and the other wanted
to observe the NSA congress.

The applications for US visas (which were de-
nied) were the first from Soviet students in
many years. Certainly this demonstrates that the
American visitors to the USSR created some curi-
osity about the US among Soviet students.

Thus the basic question becomes whether we
really want understanding between all countries.
Understanding does not mean acceptance or agree-
ment with the economic and social systems of
other nations. Understanding does mean the elim-
inator. of suspicions between nations—and sus-
picions can only be eliminated by freedom of con-
tact, travel and information between all nations.
Certainly this is a worthy goal for students to
work towards, since they will- be among those
killed in a war if understanding between nations
is not reached.

By Clive Gray

Since its very beginning in 1946 the National
Student association has supported and helped es-
tablish short- and long term exchange programs
with universities all over the world. But it has
never supported such programs on account of any
inherent value in them; rather, it has regarded
exchange programs only as a means to the end of
international understanding.

Since 1951 there have been delegations of stu-
dents from several western European countries
and the United States on tours to Russia, and So-
viet students have in turn visited Britain, Norway,
France, and other countries. Much has been writ-
ten by the participants in these exchanges, and
this material was available at the Congress; in
addition, several of the delegates have talked in
person with students who had worked with either
side of a Soviet exchange program. It was clear
that many of those involved considered the ex-
change programs a waste of time except insofar
as they were able to learn about the intransigent
Soviet mentality through them; only in a very few
cases in particular in Richard Ward’s statements,
did western students report any success whatso-
ever in communicating their ideas about actual and
ideological questions to the Soviet students.

The Soviet students were especially inclined to
regard statements of western students either as
in some way compatible with the Soviet foreign
policy line, or else completely absurd and laugh-
able. There was absolutely no middle ground for
them. And even had the Russian students been
receptive to conceptions different in sorne real
sense from their own, the organization of the ex-
change programs would have prevented sufficient

So the delegates at the National Congress felt
it would be more appropriate to pass a resolution
calling for NSA to expand its programs of student
exchange (which had already resulted in the pres-
ence arid active participation in the Congress of
40 overseas student observers), and outlining the
general criteria by which NSA officials could judge
a potential exchange program and predict its effec-
tiveness.

These criteria suggest the exchange of “ideas be-
tween free agents on a student-to-student basis”
as the “most*meaningful type of contact”; they
warn of possible misuse of exchange programs
for propagandistic ends (and material was pro-
duced which proved this had actually happened in
the case of the American student editors’ trip to
Russia); and they designate as the most meaning-
ful exchanges those which provide a “maximum
of individual contact over an extended period of
time” and which are “sufficiently flexible to per-
mit participants to gain a representative view of
the area visited and people concerned.”

On this basis, then, the NSA international vice-
president, Paul Sigmund of Harvard University, is
authorized to negotiate for and establish exchange
programs with any country, including Russia. If it
is not possible to establish an exchange program
with Russia which will fulfill these criteria and
thus further the ultimate goal of student exchange,
then NSA will concentrate on exchanging students
with countries where misunderstandings with the
U.S. are equally deep-rooted, but where some

chance of alleviating these
of ideas exists.

NSA Stability, Alertness

Impress Clive Gray

By Clive Gray

What most impressed us at the National Student association con-
gress was the soundness and stability we found within the NSA as a
result of the efforts of the national student officers of the association.
The picture we gained was of an organization alert to both the con-
scious desires and unconscious needs of the American student com-
munity, and determined to represent the student voice of all levels
of policy-making affecting the academic world.

NSA’s leaders may not have succeeded in giving the average Amer-
ican student a feeling that he has a stake in the work of NSA, and, in-
deed, the number of UC students who will note the existence of the
association for the first time through this article will prove that all
of us are far from the goal of bringing NSA’s work close to home.

But the fact remains that NSA’s workhorses for 1953-54 have with
considerable success brought to bear on Congress the desire of Amer-

ican students for income tax re-
lief and full-scale operation of the
government’s exchange pro-
grams; have exercised a positive
and respected voice in meetings of
national unions of students from
many parts of the world; and have
inaugurated a broad research pro-
gram, financed by the Ford Foun-
dation, which should help im-
mensely to strengthen effective
student self-government on cam-
puses throughout the United
States.

There is, however, a sizeable
difference between the accom-
plishments of a competent an<l
dedicated group of student admin-
istrators such as last year’s NSA
officers, and, on the other hand,
the results of a congress attended
by largely inexperienced student
representatives from 300 different
schools in all areas of the U, S.
Probably most of these 700 stu-
dents, just as ourselves, learned
a great deal about the work and
problems of the NSA through
hearing the reports of the national
officers and reading the back-
ground material for the congress’
workshop sessions.

But the positive contributions
of the congress in terms of dy-
namic policy formulation for the
Association’s future work left
much to be desired. One reason
seemed to be that a large segment
of the delegates’ time was spent
in collegiate “horsing around” —
nightly parties and songfests last-
ing so late as to retard the open-
ing of the morning sessions by an
hour and* a half past scheduled
starting-time.

Another reason for the absence
of inspired thought on the part of
most delegates seemed to be a
sense of frustration at the com-
plexity of the particular issues
confronting NSA. and a sober dis-
paragement of the effectiveness
of talk as opposed to action. Most
of the issues discussed evoked
little controversy, and where reso-
lutions came in for lengthy debate
it was often due to disagreement
about proper wording and form.

This was because the delegates
were generally agreed as to what
causes students should enlist

contact between individuals on both sides to get	,	.	, , j	•

across any well-developed ideas.	’ ’^mselves in, and had little ini-

tiative to think out dynamic ap-
proches to student action in these
causes. Only rarely did the con-
gress catch fire with a sense of
the importance of the student’s
contribution in solving certain
problems, notably in the case of
the resolution on implementation
of the Supreme Court decision
banning school segregation.

In seeking to explain the some-
what indifferent tone of the con-
gress, then, one must account for
this inertia of the individual dele-
gates, and not try to cover every-
thing under the term “conserva-
tive” or “McCarthyite” or "afraid
to speak out.”

My opinion is that the congress
staff, including the national offi-
cers, did not supply the amount of
positive guidance that was neces-
sary and therefore allowed inertia
to take over partly by default.
The cause of this was the concern
of the national officers to head off
any movement within the con-
gress that might disturb the deli-
cate balance of NSA’s policies at.
home and abroad.

Although not worried about any
left-wing within the congress —
for no one there seemed to fall
even close to the fellow-traveler

Major Resolutions
Of NSA Congress

Academic Freedom Week

An Academic Freedom Week
has been celebrated on several
campuses throughout the nation
during the past academic year.
Student governments, student or-
ganizations, faculties, and admin-
istrations have taken part in
these events.

It has always been a primary
purpose of USNSA “to main-
tain academic freedom and
student rights” on our nation’s
campuses in the interest of our
education and of democracy it-
self. It is both desirable and
vitally necessary to the contin-
ued integrity of American edu-
cation to encourage the most
a<-tive student support for the
understanding of academic free-
dom on a nationwide scale.

The Seventh USNSA Con-
gress mandates the National
Staff to sponsor a National
Academic Freedom Week, and
specifically to investigate the
time, feasibility and the possi-
bility of support from other
organizations, and to report
their findings to the December
National Executive Committee
meeting for action and an-
nouncement to the campuses.

Fair Educational Practice Code

The United States National
Student Association stands un-
alterably opposed to all forms
of discrimination in education
which are based on race, reli-
gion or national origin.

The USNSA reiterates its past
policies and declarations in oppo-
sition to such forms of discrim-
ination.

The USNSA directs the Vice-
president for Educational Affairs
to continue action toward these
ends.

It further directs him to pre-
pare and distribute a codifica-
tion of all USNSA policy on
this subject and to disseminate
information concerning prog-
ress toward achievement of the
goals set forth in these basic
policies and declarations. More-
over, it urges its member
schools and its regional organ-
izations to do all in their power
to achieve these previously
mentioned goals.

It also directs him to prepare
from the existing policy of the
USNSA a Fair Educational Prac-
tices Code.

The Student's Right to
Knowledge and the Free
Use Thereof (Part Only)

It is with regret that at the
present time the USNSA is com-
pelled to make a declaration on
behalf of the students of the
United States concerning the
problem of loyalty as it bears on
academic freedom. Furthermore,
inherent in the current problem
of loyalty is the consideration of
the rights and responsibilities of
educators.

At the outset, it should be
stated that NSA believes that
the only grounds on which a
professor should be judged are
his professional competence
and integrity. This principle is
basic. Only for lack of profes-
sional competence and integrity

should a professor be removed
from a teaching positioi

The NSA believes that member-
ship in any totalitarian conspira-
torial group or organization that
advocates the violent overthrow
of the United States government
requires acceptance of certain
principles and methods which sur-
render freedom in the search for
truth. At the present time, in al-
most every case, such member-
ship extinguishes the ability of a
professor to be professionally
competent. In addition, the NSA
reaffirms its belief in the demo-
cratic process of law wherein an
individual is presumed innocent
until proven guilty. In accord-
ance with this principle, yve point
out that membership in totalitar-
ian conspiratorial groups or or-
ganizations that advocate the vio-
lent overthrow of the govern-
ment is not, in and of itself, suf-
ficient grounds for dismissal from
a university position, but that dis-
missal is justified only after in-
vestigation of each individual
case proves professional incompe-
tence and lack of integrity.

Declaration on Exchange of
Persons ’Part Only)

USNSA has always believed
In the free exchange of students
as a means of furthering its
fundamental objective of pro-
moting international under-
standing and fellowship.

The Association notes that
such programs of exchange do
not constitute ends in them-
selves. They must successfully
take account of a number of
factors if they are to achieve
their intended purpose of pro-
mo t i n g international under-
standing and fellowship.

1.	The most meaningful type
of contact results from a
free exchange of ideas
between free agents on a
student-to-student basis.

2.	It is recognized that the
exchange of students often
may be utilized for the
purposes of partisan po-
litical propaganda, thus
subverting the legitimate
intentions and purposes of
the student groups in-
volved.

USNSA authorizes its interna-
tional vice-president, with the ap-
proval of NEC, to expand the
Association’s present program of
exchange as a means of reaching
a wider number of students
throughout the world, whenever
such programs are commensurate
with the underlying principles
and objectives of USNSA in fur-
thering international understand-
ing and fellowship. Adequate
assurances of compliance with the
factors mentioned above must be
obtained prior to the initiation of
any program. The international
vice-president is also instructed
to take specific measures to en-
courage and assist the member
schools and regions in promoting
and financing such exchange.

Exchange With the Soviet
Union (Defeated)

dent Congress progress has been
made in the improvement of com-
munication between students of

Maroon Presents
NSA Reports

On pages 6 and 7 the Maroon
presents a report on the sev-
enth annual congress of the
National Student association
(NSA) held at Iowa State Col-
lege August 22-31.

Twelve UC students, who
were elected in all-campus elec-
tions, represented the students
of the University of Chicago.

More than 700 delegates, al-
ternates and observers attend-
ed the NSA congress from over
250 colleges and universities in
the U. S.

NSA was founded in Chicago
in 1946 as an organization to
represent American students.
More than 800,000 students are
on the campuses which have
membership in NSA.

The annual congress is the
highest legislative group of
NSA. Between congresses, the
National executive committee
meets several times to help the
national officers implement
congress decisions. The NEC
may also make emergency pol-
icy decisions.

Delegates from UC were
Bruce Larkin, Lawrence Lich-
tenstein, Clive Gray, Jan Met-
ros, Richard Ward.

Lynn Burns, Albert Fortier,
Fred Solomon, Carolyn Eggert,
Barbara Vogelfanger, Robert
Floyd, and Shirley Long served

the United States and the Soviet
Union. Four separate groups of
American students have jour-
neyed to the Soviet Union in the
past year. In recent months a
group of Soviet youth and student
editors have requested permission
to visit the United States.

The American student today
faces a world divided by strong
antagonisms and suspicions be-
tween nations. As students, we
believe that the maintenance of
communication between students
of all nations can be one of our
contributions to secure a peaceful
world.

The USNSA believes that ef-
forts should be made to effect
student exchange between the
United States and the Soviet
Union and other communist coun-
tries. The USNSA believes that
Soviet students should be permit-
ted to observe American student
life and educational institutions,
and that Amedcan students
should continue to observe Soviet
student life and educational insti-
tutions.

Implementation on Supreme
Court Ruling on Segregation
(Part Only)

Segregation in education by
race is unethical and unwise. It
is now also unconstitutional. The
USNSA, pledged to seeking the
elimination of such segregation,
urges the swiftest possible inte-
gration of the races at all edu-
cational levels, in all parts of the
country. In the face of ethical con-
cepts, legal requirements, and
global ramifications, there can be
no justification for delay in the
implementation of the Supreme
Court decision.

With appreciation of the com-
plexity of the transition now at
hand, with concern for the dis-
locations and turmoil which
must be met with courage and
sense, and with enthusiasm to
use the opportunity whose
challenge and promise is of a
finer America in a -cher fu-
ture, we suggest the following
principles as guides to aid in
the achievement of the afore-
mentioned objectives:

L The immediate ending of
segregation in institutions
of higher education in all
geographic areas.

2.	The immediate desegrega-
tion ot all units of public
education in those states
in which the cultural pat-
tern, distribution of popu-
lation, racial attitudes and
other conditions warrant.
Such a policy would result
in the total desegregation
of education in Maryland,
Delaware, the District of
Columbia, Kentucky, Mis-
souri, Oklahoma, and West

Work of U C Group
Explained byChairman

By Richard Ward,

UC NSA Delegation Chairman

The delegates and alternates
representing the students of the
University of Chicago at the 7th
Annual National Student Con-
gress were active participants in
all the major activities, and de-
bates of the Congress.

The most important questions
which faced the Congress con-
cerned academic freedom, im-
plementation of the Supreme
Court decision barring segrega-
tion in public schools, student
economic welfare, and interna-
tional student relations.

The Congress adopted three
resolutions primarily concerned
with academic freedom. The dele-
gates have called upon NSA to
sponsor an academic freedom
week during the current school
year. UC delegates unanimously
supported the academic freedom
week proposal.

The most enthusiastically
greeted resolution was one
praising the Supreme Court de-
cision on segregation. The reso-
lution made recommendations
for the implementation of the
decision and proposals for stu-
dent activity. Only four persons
dissented or abstained out of
the entire Congress.

The resolution called for im-
mediate abolition of segregated
schools in higher education. It
recommended selective desegrega-
tion in lower schools. Some dele-
gates expressed opposition to this
section.

Another important concern re-
garding deprivation of rights to
minority groups was embodied in
a resolution which directed the
NSA vice-president for education-

Virginia (the so-called bor-
der state areas).

3.	The application of the prin-
ciple of selective desegre-
gation on a unit-school and
grade basis in those states
in which existing racial at-
titudes are more sharply
defined, the proportion of
Negroes to whites greater,
and the cultural patterns
less flexible.

A. National

1.	The Educational Affairs Vice-
President shall collect and
disseminate to member
schools information on the
progress of integration.

2.	The Educational Affairs Vice-
President shall make a gen-
eral report to the Eighth Na-
tional Student Congress, out-
lining progress made in this
field during the 1954-55 school
year.

We recommend that each re-
gion of USNSA act as a coordi-
nating agency within its own
territory for the purpose of
holding discussions and ex-
changing information.

(from page 6)
category — the national officers
were afraid that the pro-Soviet
exchange forces might succeed in
committing the association to. an
intractible and politically unwise
position on that question.

As it happened, their proposal
was defeated 235-69, after the dele-
gates had had an opportunity to
hear detailed reports on previous
student exchange programs with
Russia, and decided the wiser pol-
icy would be to empower the NSA
international vice-president to en-
list NSA’s support behind indi-
vidual exchange programs as cir-
cumstances warranted. In line
with this, exchange with Soviet
Russia is not excluded.

In the end, no faction succeeded
in putting the NSA in an irrespon-
sible light on any major question,
and the congress staff felt re-
lieved. But we had to wonder
whether their efforts (and some
of our own) had been as positive
as later insights indicated they
could and should have been.

Now all this is water over the

al affairs to draw up a fair edu-
cational practices code. The code
would be compiled from NSA poli-
cies which oppose all discrimina-
tion in education based on race,
religion, or national origin.

Another FEPC resolution with
an already formulated code was
defeated. The UC delegation orig-
inally supported that resolution.

Whether or not NSA should en-
dorse the principle of student ex-
change between the United States
and Soviet Union was the most
widely debated question at the
student congress.

The role of the UC delegation
stood in marked contrast to the
unanimity expressed in the de-
bates for an acadenre freedom
week, an FEPC code, and other
important resolutions.

Standing against exchange pro-
posal, which was defeated by a
large majority, were Clive Gray,
Bruce Larkin, Barbara Vogelfan-
ger. Jan Metros, Al Fortier. Vot-
ing for the exchange were Larry
Lichtenstein, Carolyn Eggert,
Fred Solomon, Carolyn Burns, and
myself.

On other international exchange
issues, the Congress voted to in-
volve itself in a program of inter-
national exchange with "all coun-
tries.” Members of the UC delega-
tion who supported the Soviet ex-
change proposal disagreed over
the interpretation of “all.”

The work of UC delegation
members did not end with the
close of the Congress. Bruce Lar-
kin and Lawrence Lichtenstein
served at the post-congress na-
tional executive committee meet-
ing. Larkin was elected chairman
of the executive committee, NSA’s
highest policy group between an-
nual congresses.

dam. and a fine group of national
officers for the coming year will
give the NSA one more mighty
push forward. Also, delegates for
whom the discovery of NSA’s im-
portance was a revelation at the
congress will vigorously interpret
the meaning of the association’s
work to their campuses.

But officers and delegates at the
eighth national student congress
next year would do well to study
the lesson of Ames.

Lichtenstein ...

(from page 6)

that international understanding
among the students of all coun-
tries is a positive force for peace.
To say these things today would
endanger NSA. For the officers
the answer was simply not to say
these things; and this is the idea
they tried to implant in the dele-
gates.

This was done in various ways;
in the exchange sub-commission
everytime there was a danger of
the students thinking favorably
of East-West exchange, the inter-
national vice-president was sum-
moned and he arrived on the scene
usually with three or four helpers-,
to quench the fire. The first few
times his arrival might have been
coincidental; after two days of
such hurried entrances it became
obvious just what their purpose
was.

The fact that the officers suc-
ceeded as well as they did, as
illustrated by numerous side-
stepped issues by issue "referred”
and issues "investigated” merely
means that a great part of the.
time students were not thinking
individually or courageously about
the controversial issues; and the
atmosphere of the congress sup-
plied the milieu for such lack of
thinking.

Nevertheless there was some
excellent thinking and forthright
action at the Congress, as may be
seen from the examples above.
It is this positive action that was
taken, and the obvious potential
in the students for more, coura-
geous action, that is encouraging.
This, coupled with the recognition
of the necessity and importance
of a national student organization
makes NSA a fertile ground for
continued student participation.

Urey to Receive Award

Harold C. Urey, Martin A Ryerson distinguished service professor
in the department of chemistry and a member of the Institute of
Nuclear Studies, will receive the 1954 Testimonial Award of the Chi-
cago Chapter of the American Institute of Chemists this evening.

The award will be made at a dinner in Professor Urey’s honor.
He will be granted the award “in recognition for his active devotion
to the thesis that scientists have an obligation to society as citizens
equal to their obligation as scientists; for his unceasing efforts to
emphasize the use of fissionable materials and nuclear devices for
peaceful purposes; for his outspoken defense of academic and scien-
tific freedom, and for his distinguished scientific achievements.”

Excerpts from Professor Urey’s talk to be delivered on this occa-
sion, will be published in next week's Maroon.

Dream Studio Opened in Lexington
Haphazard Exhibit Featured

by Edna Bashkin

The art student's dream studio has been opened in Lexington hall.

The campus studio, previously housed in the basement of B-J. has moved to larger, perfectly lighted,
and more easily accessible quarters in Lexington. Its excellent workshop facilities are open to all stu-
dents interested in painting, sculpture, etching, drawing from life, or exploring any of their experi-
mental ideas in art.

The studio will be open during the following hours ev°ry week:

Graduate Fellowship

Tuesday and

Wednesday

To Give Programs

“What is Existentialism?” will be the theme of a series of
programs to be held in Chapel House on five successive Thurs-
day evenings, it was announced by the graduate fellowship
of the Porter foundation. Porter Foundation is the Presby-
terian and Congregational sponsored program on campus.

The first meeting, held yesterday, was an open house for

It will also serve as an exhibi-

tion gallery of student and
fessional work throughout
year.

The present exhibit, which

pro-
the

wili

new graduate students who
were addressed by Professor
J. Coert Rylaarsdam on “Ex-
istentialism and the Bible.”

The following programs in the
aeries will take up the relation-
ship of existentialism to several
other fields. Pierre Delattre.
chairman of the Chapel House
committee on religion and art,
will lead an illustrated discussion
next Thursday on “Existentialist
expression in modern art.”

During the three succeeding
weeks. October 21 and 28. and
November 4. the speakers and
•objects will be Dr. Helmut Se-
ckel of the department of pedi-
atrics. “Existentialist thought in
psychiatry;” John B. Thompson,
dean of Rockefeller chapel, “The

existentialism of Sartre and Ca-
mus;” and Perry D. LeFevre of

the Federated Theological

ty, “Existentialism in

Christian thought.”

The meetings are open

facul-
recent

to all

members of the University com-
munity.

Petitions Due

All petitions for candidacy in
the Student Government elections
must be filed by next Tuesday,
according to Herb Schwartz, vice-
president of SG. The elections will
be held the following week on

run for two more weeks, is a re-
trospective show of a great vari-
ety of student work. It suffers
somewhat from a rather haphaz-
ard selection of “stuff left be-
hind,” but this is also a point of
interest because of the great vari-
ety in media, approach and qual-
ity of the work.

Tn addition to a number of
rather noisy humanities I exer-
cises in color and some lumpy-
looking clay pieces, there are sev-
eral works of real interest. Among

the most notable is a painting by
Daniels. This is done in a hodge-
podge of media, but in spite of
this “experimental” character, it
carries weight as a strong, dra-
matic composition.

Though quite simple, School-
craft's study of the steel mills
very quietly evokes a strong
mood reaction with its restrained
rosy glow and solid, plain forms.
It has a quality of stability and
simplicity greatly lacking in even
the better student paintings.

The one possible exception is an
unsigned tempera wedge between
two rather ordinary paintings by
Harry Adler. Adler does, however,
show a skillful and sensitive hand
in his ink drawing of horses.

Among the sculpture, there are
three pieces in particular very
much worth seeing. Jane Fern
uses her solid forms and defined

has both the awkwardness and un-
conscious grace of all young ani-
mals.

Joe Pincus’s two-figure piece,
unfortunately broken and poorly
exhibited, is nevertheless worthy
of study if you can find it in the
back of the cupboard.

Nicest of all the sculpture is the
half-dancing, half flying colt by
Mrs. Fern. It is built in plaster
over an armature on a tall wooden
support which lifts it high in the
air and helps the horse in his
movements.

The entire group of pastels
could be dispensed with. Contrary
to much popular l^lief, pastels
is not an easy medium and to use
them well takes a great deal more
than the ability to hold the chalk
stick.

The many black and white
drawings and etchings are gen-

erally good, studied work and in
special areas very expressively— their quiet way raise the quality

especially in the young deer which of the entire exhibit.

A CAMPUS-TO-CAREER CASE HISTORY

Toxoid Qiven

Tetanus toxoid was adminis-
tered to all incoming students as
a part of their physical examina-
tions for the first time this year.

The only preventive treatment
for people who have not had the
toxoid is tetanus anti-toxin, a sub-
stance to which may people show
a great sensitivity. If the toxoid
has been administered previously,
however, a booster shot of the
toxoid is sufficient and no ill ef-
fects result.

A doctor on the Billings staff
said of the new shot, “It’s about
time they did (give the toxoid),
for the same reason that they are
given to kids going to camp and to
men in the Army—that is. unless
they have previously had a tet-
anus shot, they will be in a mess
if they should cut themselves on
a rusty nail. There is no harm in
giving these shots.

At International House

International house residents will be able to listen to WUCB
next week, according to John Lyon, manager of the campus

radio station.

Difficulties with the telephone
company have prevented the
house transmitter from going on
the air thus far, but the station
staff is hopeful that connections
will be completeci and broadcast-
ing begun by Monday.

WUCB, also known as Radio
Midway, will be picked up at a
frequency of 640 by any AM radio
in the house. The station now has
transmitters in Burton-Judson and
the C-Group and can be received
anywhere in these dorms.

The station started broadcast-
ing last Monday with a minimal
broadcast schedule. Currently it
is presenting its own programs
from 7:30 to approximately 9:30
p.m. Monday through Friday, and
re-broadcastings programs of
WEFM, an FM station, for the re-
mainder of the time from 9:30
a.m. to midnight. Eventually the
station hopes to extend its own
program to 10:30 or 11 p.m., and

According to superintendent

in especially bad condition. Being
in dire need of cement, they have
the immediate attention, four

Describe History of Football,
Fights, Incidents Mentioned

By Sam Greenlee

The pigskins are flying through
the air—well, they are in some
not-too-distant places—and so are
the invectives about overempha-
sis. Over half a century ago a guy
who happened to be a college pres-
ident, of all people, became the
first member of the overempha-
sis school when he refused to per-
mit the school football team to
compete in an intercollegiate con-
test'with another university. “I re-
fuse to authorize the travel of
over a hundred miles by students
of this institution to engage in the
agitation of a bag of wind,” said
the prexy. He should see things
now!

Students Travel

Not only do students travel over
• hundred miles to agitate said
bag of wind but sometimes thou-
sands and occasionally make
ocean voyages as do some of the
Pacific coast schools annually to
play the University of Hawaii. In-
stead of a few bored students with
nothing to do lounging along the
sidelines as spectators, huge sta-
dia filled to overflowing by up to
* hundred thousand screaming
maniacs witness this thing called
football. Even more important, al-
though our prexy's modern coun-
terparts would be the last to ad-
mit it. is that the people in those
huge bowls of concrete and steel
pay cash on the barrelhead to
watch the game.

Tell Moral

This brings us face to face with
that thing that used to come at the
end of every story, but which ap-
pears earlier here because, believe
it or not, this ain’t no fairy tale.
That thing, kiddies, is a moral. It
might sound something like this:
once upon a time football was a
pleasant way to get one’s heads
bashed in in relatively discreet pri-
vacy. or to really die for old Si-
wash, also with few witnesses.
Then along came a Joe whose fa-
vorite pastime was paying some of
his weekly allowance to see two
guys beat each other to bloody
pulps while he cried in the pear
shaped tones he had learned in the
speech class he flunked the year
before. ‘'Kill da bum!”

The aforementioned portion of
his allowance plus that for beer
and the burlesque show meant
that our hero had to forego his
lunches and skimp on Saturday
night dates. This character, who
we shall call Ethelbert because all
heroes must have names, hap-
pened to pass the football field
one day and almost ran into two
stretcher bearers carrying a gory
figure to the student health in-
firmary—God rest his soul.

Curiosity Aroused

This aroused Ethelbert's curi-
osity because he hadn’t seen so
much of the red stuff since the
pugs stopped boxing bare knuckle.
He thereupon rushed over to the
field, which had half a dozen of
the player’s fraternity brothers
standing around in hopes that one
of said players would break a leg
—just slight, of course, so that
they could borrow his tux for next
week’s formal. With one glance
Ethelbert observed that here were
not two but twenty-two men bent
on annihilating one another —
which was eleven times better.
Besides, his view was not ob-
scured by smoke, and most impor-
tant he could see this mass maul
for free.

Gets Stouter

Soon our hero’s cronies ob-
served that he was getting stouter

from eating his lunches regularly,
that he was always with enough
money for beer and that he some-
times took out two girls on Satur-
day. These things provoked ques-
tions which Ethelbert refused to
answer but it was observed that
he was among the missing at the
weekly fights and that he was go-
ing for walks every Saturday aft-
ernoon. They decided to follow
him on one excursion, since Ethel-
bert was known to hate fresh air
almost as much as math. Word
got around and soon as many as a
few hundred reformed boxing
fans would crowd the sidelines to
witness the carnage and interpose
“Hit ’em again,” for the time hon-
ored. “Kill da Bum!”

Crowd Pushes

The coach found that the crowd
often got out of hand in pushing
closer to view the slaughter and
thereupon hit upon the idea of
discouraging them by building a
fence around the field and charg-
ing admission.

This had the age-old effect of
proving that the whole thing must
be worthwhile because, after all,
it cost money to see. This led to
building stands on the edge of the
field which in turn proved inade-
quate, until by the time Ethel-
bert, Jr., was using his old man’s
crib notes to flunk math under
the same professor, the “U” had
mortgaged the campus to build a
permanent stadium to be used five
Saturdays a year.

Thus an investment was made
which made it necessary to make
a profit which made it necessary
to win since blood alone was not
enough to attract the decadent
younger as it had their parents.
The coach, therefore, spent his
summers looking for big husky
farm boys to provide enough beef
to win a few games. So you see,
kiddies, football was no longer a
game where a man could commit
suicide or murder in privacy, as
the mood hit him. but a business
requiring profits. Then some of
the teachers who showed how
much they hated money by refus-
ing to work for a living — and
taught instead—and prompted by
the fact that the coach made
more dough, pointed out that
school was a place for higher
learning and such base extracur-
ricular activities as football were
out of place in such an institution.
This the t e n - m e n coaching,
the athletic news bureau, the ac-
countant who counted the profits,
and the trainer who patched up
the behemoths pooh - poohed be-
cause they were character-build-
ers as any fool could plainly see.

Ranks Swell

The revolutionaries became ul-
timately to be known as de-em-
phasizers and their ranks were
swelled when a big university in
a big, dirty city whose initials are
Chicago attracted less man-moun-
tains than they had in years pre-
vious when they had trampled
everyone in sight and becoming
thoroughly sick of being slaugh-
tered every Saturday and sicker
of the empty stands decided that
they didn’t like the nasty old game
and the money they weren’t mak-
ing anymore, and packed up their
ball and quit.

So now we find that every fall
colleges are split like was said in
the last paragraph and professors
choke every time they think how
the coach makes more dough—•
and with only a bachelor’s degree,
too, and college presidents who

Sam Greenlee, shown going
on for Wisconsin, has finally
come on to Chicago where he is
now' running longer distances in
soft shoes for the cross coun-
try team.

don’t have adequate recruiting
staffs and can’t get the fancy
stepping backs and huge linemen
decide that recruiting should be
curtailed, and the sportswriters
write that nothing’s wrong with
the set-up because just look how
the press boxes have improved,
and the coaches become nervous
wrecks because their quarterback
calls the wrong play in the big
game and they have to look for a
new job the next season, and the
old grads get drunker than they
had when trying the stuff for the
first time as freshmen, and the
students sit up in the corner of
the stadium and wmnder how
those characters who certainly
aren’t in school get to sit on the
fifty-yard line, and the guy in
charge of selling tickets tries to
think of some way to keep the
“college atmosphere” and still get
the students out of the stadium so
he can hike the prices of those
seats, and the players practice
five or six hours every day until
the game ain’t fun no more, and
some people go out every Satur-
day and enjoy hell out of the game
without trying to analyze its un-
healthly influences.

And just to show' that this may
be a fairy tale after all the moral
come at the end because it might
not be so clear after what has
gone before. So it’s this: if Ethel-
bert had had enough money to get
drunk on beer the night before he
discovered football was such a
fascinating game he w’ould never
have had a hangover and never
passed the field at such a fateful
time which started the whole sor-
did mess in the first place.

UC Dogs Taken for Horses
Race Each Other, Qet Ready

By Paul Baptist

"They’re off and running at Washington Park!’*

"You’re nuts, buddy, they’re running at Hawthorne
already.”

"Not horses, dopey, but the UC harriers.”

“Oh, dog races, I didn’t know' they had ’em in these parts.”

Friday afternoon, in an intra
of the season tomorrow, the
UC canines were divided into
tw’O teams by their famous
trainer, Ted Haydon, and pitted
against each other in a dog-eat-
dog three-mile contest in Wash-
ington Park. In a blanket finish.
Paul Baptist came out top dog
with a 16:22 effort, closely fol-
lowed by Walt Deike, Jim Flynn,
and Toulouse Otromundo in that
order, all with times inside 16:30.
And when Ted Fishman and Lo-
well Hawkinson finished iaside

-squad tune-up for the opening

17 minutes, it marked the best
teaem performance at three miles
in the history of the University.

Back in the locker-room, the
dog-tired runners gleefully antici-
pated the rounding into shape of
such established performers as
Sam Greenlee. John Srrothers,

uation of their dynasty by a
promising crop of first year men

MY COUSIN HASKELL

I have a cousin named Haskell Krovney, a sweet, unspoiled country
boy, who has just started college. A letter arrived from him this
morning which I will reprint here because I know that Haskell’s
problems are so much like your own. Haskell writes:

Dear Haskell (he thinks my name is Haskell too),

I see that you are writing a column for Philip Morris cigarettes.
I think they are keen cigarettes which taste real good and which
make a pleasant noise when you open the pack, and I want to tell
you why I don’t smoke them.

It all started the very first day I arrived at college. I had just
gotten off the train and was walking across the campus, swinging
my cardboard valise whistling snatches of Valencia, Harney Google,
and other latest tunes, admiring statues, petting dogs and girls, when
all of a sudden I ran into this fellow with a blue jacket, gray pants,
and white teeth. He asked me was I a freshman. I said yes. He asked
me did I want to go places on campus, make a big name for myself,
and get pointed at in fashionable ballrooms and spas. I said yes. He
said the only way to make ail these keen things happen was to
join a fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card
on him, so he pricked my thumb and* I signed. He didn’t tell me the
name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I suppose I’ll find
out when I go active.

Meanwhile this fellow comes around every week and collects his
dues which are $100. Lately he has been collecting $10 extra each
week. He says this is a fine because I missed the meeting. When I
remind him that I can’t go to meetings because I don’t know where
the house is, he twists my arm.

I have never regretted joining the fraternity because it is my
dearest wish to be somebody on campus and get pointed at in spas,
but you can see that it isn’t cheap. It wouldn’t be so bad if I slept
at the house, but you must agree that I can’t very well sleep at
the house if I don’t know where the house is.

I have had to rent a room. This room is not only hellishly expensive,
but it isn’t the kind of room I wanted at all. What I was looking for
was someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and within easy
walking distance of classes, the downtown shopping district, the
movies, and my home town. What I found was a bedroom in the
home of a local costermonger, which is dingy, expensive, uncom-
fortable, inconvenient, and I don’t even get to use the bed till six
o’clock in the morning when my Landlord goes off to mong his costers.

Well, anyhow, I got settled and started going to classes. But first
I had to pay my tuition. This came to a good deal more than the
advertised rates. When I asked the bursar what the extra money
was for, he told me lab fees. When I said I wasn’t taking any labs,
he said I was taking psychology which counted as a lab because
they used white mice. When I offered to bring my own mice, of
which there are plenty in my room, he twisted my arm.

So I* paid the man and went to my classes where I found that
all my professors had spent busy summers writing brand new text-
books. Over to the bookstore I went, saw the prices on the text-
books, and collapsed in a gibbering heap. At length I recovered and
made indignant demands to speak to the proprietor, but they told
me the Brinks truck had already taken him home for the day. There
was nothing for it but to buy the books.

Next I turned to romance—and found it. Harriet, her name was—a
great, strapping girl. I first spied her leaning against the statue of
the Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours without
effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her milky little
eyes opened, she raised a heavy arm, seized my nape, and dragged
me off to a dimly lit place called The Trap where everything was
a la carte. She ordered cracked crab ($1.75), sirloin Chateaubriand
($7.00), a scuttle of french fries (18( the french fry), an artichoke
(30( the leaf), and compote (80( the prune).

. After dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not rouse
her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with my fork. I did
bird calls of North and South America. I pinched her huge pendulous
jowl. I rubbed the legs of my corduroy pants together ... But nothing
worked, and finally I had to sling her over my shoulder and carry
her to the girls dormitory, to the vast amusement of everybody
along the route.

But it was not the jeers of bystanders that bothered me. It was
the hernia. Fortunately, medical care for students is provided free
at the college dispensary; all I had to pay for were a few extras,
like X-rays, anaesthesia, operating room, forceps, hemostats, scal-
pels, sponges, catgut, linens, towels, amortization, and nurses. They
would not, however, let me keep the nurses.

So, dear, cousin, if you see me these days without a Philip Morris
cigarette, it is not because I don’t like Philip Morris cigarettes. I
do. I flip xHien I taste their mild rare vintage tobaccos. But I can’t
afford cigarettes. I can’t even afford matches, what with fraternity
dues and room rent and lab fees and textbook prices and my girl
Harriet and medical care.

Well, I’ll write you again soon. Keep ’em flying.

Yr. Cousin,

Haskell

/HE CHICAGO MAROON

Page 11

Soccer Season Opens

With pointed toe and full concentration John Godfrey dribbles
downfield in soccer practice Monday. On Wednesday his tricky
dribbling and accurate shooting scored the Maroon’s first goal of
the season, against Morton.

Sports Doings Are Varied

Twenty basketball candidates reported to practice Monday
including “C” winners Fred Hubbard, Bill Lester, and Dick
Homer. Even with 6' S1^* Hubbard on the court a bystander
shrewdly remarked, “We’re still a —-----

team of little men, we still don’t
have the big men.” Practice con-
tinues every day in the Field house
from 3:30 to 5:30.

Walt Deike, medical student and
ex-western conference cross
country champ, has decided to use
his remaining year of eligibility
in competition this year instead of
next. Deike, a smooth “picture”
runner, had originally planned to
wait until the season prior to the
'56 Olympics to do his last col-
legiate running. His decision adds
another good runner to Ted Hay-
don’s already large group.

“Do your friends avoid you be-
cause you don’t know the airplane
spin? Wrestle!” Anyone con-

vinced by these lines on a poster
in Bartlett gym began learning
the airplane spin last Monday.

Wrestling coach Al Bates is par-
ticularly anxious about bringing
his brand of popularity to some
heavyweights this year. His
charm school runs five days a
week in Bartlett.

Art Omohundro, at 118 pounds,
the featherweight champ of the
track and cross country teams,
has had his name changed. His
running mates have unofficially
rechristened him “Toulouse Otro-
mundo,” apparently for aesthetic
reasons. This new label will not
make typesetters any more con-

fident through the track and cross
country seasons. Etaoin shrdlu.

Adjoining the wrestling mats
in Bartlett are the rubber mats
and wall mirrors used by the fenc-
ing team. Foil, sabre and epee
men began practice there Monday,
but without a full time coach.
Alvar Hermanson must guide the
soccer players on Stagg field most
afternoons until the end of No-
vember.

Next Monday marks the start
of intramural touchball and tennis
play. The all-University tennis
tournament begins the same day,
the winner to receive the M-medal
in that sport.

Don Donderi uses some of the
disarming technique he has
learned in Al Bates’ “charm
school” on clench-teethed Chuck
Carlson.

UC Opens Soccer Season,

Win 6-1 Against Morton

Substitutions and shifting lineups marked the Maroon soc-
cer opener on Stagg field Wednesday, six players scoring as
many goals to down Morton Jr. College, 6-1.

Coach Alvar Hermanson seemed to be using liberal substi-

tutions to gauge the skill of his men in preparation for to-
morrow’s away game at Wheaton. He sent three or four new

men into the game in every
quarter, particularly after
Chicago jumped to a three
goal lead in the first part of the
game.

John Godfrey, Dick Stavely,
and Said Aby-Rish all scored in
the first quarter Godfrey’s goal,
first of the season fo the Ma-
roons, came on his st ialty, a

X*greasy hair spoiling your looks? keep it neat without greaser with wildroot cream-oil^

penalty kick. The goals by Stavely
and Aby-Rish came in quick suc-
cession. and Morton n wer seemed
in real contention afterward".

Morton’s lone score came in the
second quarter, Rich Stranski
kicking that one for the visitors.
But Bill Vanderbyl answered with
one for Chicago in the same per-
iod. George Stone added another
in the third quarter, and Ron
Crutchfield made it six in the
final period while Morton was
held scoreless. Morton rarely
even got the ball past their own
midfield line, being forced to the
defensive for most of the \

In spite of the game’s one-
sidedness, Coach Herrnan.cn had
reason for shifting f'c lineup in
search of his best players.
