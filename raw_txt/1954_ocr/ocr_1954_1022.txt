Control of government object

of both political parties

Student elections on campus entered their final day this morning. At stake is a majority
jn the 46-seat student assembly and control of this year’s Student Government.

Contesting for control are the two campus political parties, Independent Student League
and Student Representative Party. No independents will be on the ballot.

SRP has been unable to contest eleven seats; ISL has been unable to contest three. Though
neither side is making predictions, it is generally recognized that SRP will have a difficult

time overcoming their eight-
seat deficit.

Representation in the stu-
dent assembly is divided by divi-
sions and schools, with the college
forming a distinct electoral divi-
sion. One delegate represents
roughly 100 students with a mini-
mum of one seat for each body.

Student Government is the
official spokesman of the student
bod> before the University admin-
istration. Except in certain small
areas reserved to the Interfrater-
nity council, the Government is
the supreme student voice in mat-
ters pertaining to the student code
and bill of rights. It may change

the code or bill of rights with
the consent of the administration.

SG also has acted as a political

action group. When the University
was under investigation by the
Illinois assembly several years
ago, SG organized the All-Campus
Civil Liberties committee which
sent students to testify before the
investigating committee.

Student Government has taken
an increasing interest in recent
years in services to students. Ef-
forts have been made to form co-
ops to provide books, housing, and
meals more cheaply. At present
SG runs a book exchange for used
boooks, a ticket bureau, and a
mimeo service. It has also spon-
sored tours of the city.

Kimpton returns from Europe;
Compares foreign, US schools

By Ronald Grossman and Joy Burbach

Disagreeing with Robert M. Hutchins’ often-quoted comment that European school uni-
versities are iar superior to American ones, Lawrence A. Kimpton said this week in an in-
terview, “I think the fault lies not with our universities, but with our secondary; schools.”

Chancellor Kimpton, who recently returned fromTuropean tour which he and Mrs. Kimp-
ton took under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation, gave his impressions on a variety

of subjects. .

“All the continental univer-
sities are highly specialized,”
stated Kimpton, “but the kind
of program offered in European
secondary schools is very superior
indeed.”

‘‘Both Cambridge and Oxford
Universities are sports-mad,”
Kimpton commented. However, he
qualified this by saying, “It’s not
of I he semi-professional character
of American college sports.” He
explained that they take their
sports very seriously but in the
proper perspective.

“You’ve got to have a sense
of freedom that Berlin does not
have. I was very much disap-
pointed in Berlin.” Kimpton said
in referring to the Free Univer-
sity of Berlin. Because it is sur-
rounded by the Russian zone, it
does hot have the atmosphere in
which a university can flourish,

Kimpton felt. “There is a sense
of fright in the air. Your passport
is checked endlessly in Berlin,”
he said.

Kimpton explained that the su-
periority of secondary school edu-

cation in Europe in giving stu-
dents a good liberal education
makes up for the high degree of
specialization found in the univer-
sities. He also added that most
men and women entering Euro-
pean universities are two or three
years older than those entering
American school*. This is because
the secondary schools in Europe
approximate the age level of our
high school through junior college
period.

Europeans don’t understand

Kimpton added, “Students and
faculty members there do not
fully understand or appreciate
what we know as “general educa-
tion.”

College life at the English col-
leges makes up for this great
amount of specialization by allow-
ing the students to be exposed to
liberal education through discus-
sions and living with an immense
variety of people. There is a high

Comps sr te^Is music history

“Music is entirely useless,” emphasized Ralph Vaughan-Williams in the English compos-
er’s Moody lecture here October 14, entitled “The background of music.” However this means,
he qualified useless only in the material sense, comparing music to castles, houses, etc.,
which are preserved solely for their aesthetic value, retaining their beauty while losing

their usefulness*

Interspersing his lecture with frequent demonstrations from recordings and the piano,
performed by William Hutch-
inson, Vaughan-Williams at-
tempted to outline‘the general
development pf Western music

and describe its sources.

Music, according to one of his
definitions, is “an attempt to
reach the ultimate realities
through the medium of ordered
and beautiful sound.” It is a
method to “reach out beyond vi-
sion through vision itself.” Orig-
inating in excited speech when
the emotions of the speaker bursts
the bonds of language, it first ap-
peared in singing on mere vowel
sounds, called a jubilation by the
ancients and having for them an
important mystical significance.

The composer then proceeded
to demonstrate the development
of a folk tune from the natural
inflections of the speaking voice,
emphasizing the simple yet funda-
mental nature of such music. In
fact, he said, the only difference
between appreciating a simple
tune and, say, Beethoven’s Ninth
Symphony is a matter of practice
in listening, requiring simply dif-
ferent degrees of musical mem-
ory.

After some general discussion
and demonstration of the main
elements of music: melody,
rhythm and harmony, Vaughan-
Williams gave some idea of the

to give us this power to SG. Stu-
dents feel that SG should concern
itself with self government and
services.”

Stand on record

“This ISL view of SG is not
‘restricted’ but ‘constricted,’”
countered Raskin. “Students are
part of a greater society, and
must acknowledge their member-
ship in this democratic society by
taking an active part in it.”

“The voice of an individual is
often ignored,” added Breslow.
“If students want to promote aca-
demic freedom and civil rights, it
is only through a group such as
SG thta their ideas can be of any
effectivness.

Reviewing the record of ISL in
the area of student services, For-
tier stated, “We’re proud of our
record; our past successess in
fulfilling campaign pledges should
assure students of ISL’s con-
tinued success. We are now trying
to establish an eating co-op, a
place where cheaper books can be
bought, a student publicity bu-
reau, a commuter service, tutorial
services, measures for lowering
tuition, and an expanded discount
program.”

Hurl countercharges

SRP debaters, however, did not
regard the ISL record in such a
favorable light. ISL, claimed Bres-
low, consistently fought SRP pro-
posals for book, housing, and eat-
ing co-ops. The $500 which built
“that thing” in the Reynolds club
basement, could have been put
into starting co-ops far more effi-
cient than the present student
service center, he charged.

Breslow further accused ISL
of voting against the very student
exchanges they ballyhooed, plac-
ing ads from discriminatory
places of business in the SG hand-
book, and grossly mismanaging
the SG non-discriminatory hous-
ing files.

Accusing Breslow and Raskin
of “McCarthy” tactics, Gray re-
futed SRP charges and countered
that SRP had an exceedingly poor
record as majority party and that
SRP members “stand on noble
principles without the slightest
idea of how they can be imple-
mented.”

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Adler describes his

dialetical experiment'

by Prentiss Choate

How to turn the “anarchic diversity” among philosophers
into “intelligible diversity” was the major problem dealt with
by Mortimer J. Adler in a speech last Friday.

* Speaking at university college on “The nature of intellectual
work,” first in a series of lectures on “Works of the mind.”

Adler described the experimer
ophers have been carrying on
to cope with this problem.

“Intellectual diversity is in-
trinsic to. and Ineradicable from,
the consideration of fundamental
ideas, which are the substance of
philosophy," said Adler. “The
most shocking thing that could
happen would be for all philos-
ophers to agree!”

However, he said, the human
mind needs unity — it abhors
chaos. But there is no unity
among philosophers. What is the
answer? To understand the dif-
ferences and their causes.

We cannot do this now. accord-
ing to Adler, because philosophers
do not come to terms. It is very
difficult, he said, to state the
question which Plato, for exam-
ple. answers yes and Aristotle no.
There is non-agreement rather
than disagreement, because dif-
ferent philosophers do not speak
to the same set of issues.

Leads to confusion

The result is that the more
philosophy one reads, the more
he is confused, and most laymen,
and even profesosrs are at heart
‘deeply anti-intellectual.” There-
fore. says Adler, “in place of this
anarchic diversity we must have
ordered and understood diver-
sity.”

And the way to do this is
through taxonomy, as the biol-
ogists have done. If we can find
the “family lines” in philosophical
viewpoints, and trace the origin
and development of diverse views
on a given issue, “we can find out
who’s against whom,” and intro-
duce order into the diversity.

Define freedom problems

This is what Adler and his col-
leagues have tried to do with re-
gard to the subject of freedom. In
a volume soon to appear, they
have taken the various concepts
of freedom and derived 30 or 40
specific yes-and-no issues. They
also indicate the basic assump-

he and several other philos-

Mortimer J. Adler
tions two thinkers must agree to
before they can even get into a
dispute on one of these issues.

It took 15 men 15 months to
produce this result, said Adler.
But then—he queried—“what on
earth happens in the normal proc-
ess of education? What do we do
with our minds when we read
philosophy?”

Aims at progress

If successful, Adler believes,
this experiment will have an im-
portant effect on both education
and philosophy. For philosophical
progress is analogous to scien-
tific progress -a scientist who
makes a great discovery has been
extensively prepared for by team-
work among many scientists and
gathering of data.

Similarly this dialectical experi-
ment furnishes the material and
data, he said, and paves the way
for a genius to arise and make a
real advance in philosophy.

Re-interpretation
of eligibility rules
eliminates eight

The election and rules com-
mittee of Student Government
was, by Wednesday of this
week, still trying to find a
satisfactory answer to the ques-
tion “Who is actually eligible to
run for SG?”

This problem centered around
the provision in the SG constitu-
tion and the current SG election
law for averaging the grades of
the candidates.

According to the current provi-
sion, candidates must have at
least a “C” average to be eligible
to run. Deciding that the law was
ambiguous, the executive council
of SG worked out a clarification.

This clarification has led to the
dropping of four ISL candidates,
Dewey Jones, Mary Joan Spiegel,
Stan Fox, and Jack Campbell; and
four SRP candidates. Shirley
Long, Jerry Seifert, Dale Chap-
man, and Michael Wyatt.

Commenting on the results of
the committee’s work, Don Ander-
son, SRP member of the election
and rules committee, stated, “I
only ask one question: Is making
the political election and rules
committee a court, responsible
government?”

Representing the ISL view-
point, Jim Handler, chairman of
the committee, reported, “If An-
derson gets confused so easily,
I’m sorry for him. We believe that
a law should not be changed just
to serve the interest or conveni-
ence of the moment.”

Birenbaum takes
leave of absence

William Birenbaum, direc-
tor of student activities, will
be on leave-of-absence until
January 1, 1955. Dean Strozier an-
nounced Wednesday. lie will be
replaced during this time Jay Wil-
liam E. Scott, registrar.

Birenbaum has spent the past
summer doing intensive research
under the auspices of the confer-
ence board of associated research
councils. Washington, D. C.. on
the problems of advanced level
professional, scientific and schol-
arly international exchanges un-
dertaken by government and pri-
vate institutions and foundations.
He will devote the next two
months to completing this re-
search in preparation for a na-
tional conference to be held at

Maritain advocates triumph
of tolerance through reason

by Sam Blazer

“A democracy must have its own concept of man in soci-
ety,” stated visiting French philosopher Jacques Maritain last
Thursday in the last of two lectures on “Tolerance — its mean-
ing and practical implications.”

Believing that unlimited tolerance is undesirable (the indi-
vidual ego is restricted in what it can tolerate), and that

intolerance has always been
an instinctive human condi-
tion. Maritain advocated a
conquest of reason over ani-
mality.

Consistency needed

Noting that law’s final object is
to make men morally good, Mari-
tain quoted at length from St.
Thomas Aquinas, who prescribed
that law must be homogeneous
with nature and a fatherland’s
custom.

He saw the need for a human
law for a multitude of men not
“perfected by virtue.” and for a
body politic heedful of its own
moral existence as a whole, acting
as “a conscience for the human
subject,” and realizing that free-
dom of expression is a basic, nor-
mal, essential requirement for
the common good.

However, he asserted, there are
two legitimate areas for the re-
striction of this freedom. One is
for the preservation of the essen-

Child discipline
topic of lecture

Dr. Robert J. Havighurst, pro-
fessor of education at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, will speak on
“discipline of the child” in the sec-
ond lecture of a series on child de-
velopment sponsored by the Uni-
versity of Chicago veterans nurs-
ery school. The lecture will be
next Tuesday night, October 26,
at 8 p.m. in Judd 126. Admission
is 50 cents.

Havighurst, author of many
books, including Human Develop-
inept and Education and Who
Shall Be Educated? has conduct-
ed research in the field of human
development at all age levels.

The third lecture will be given
by Dr. Kermit Eby on “Religion
and the child.”

Need volunteer workers for

Douglas campaign program

Campaign work in behalf of Senator Paul Douglas during
his present race for re-election will be discussed and prepared
for at Students for Douglas meetings Monday, in Law South
at 4:30 p.m., and Tuesday, in Law North, again at 4:30 p.m.

Anyone who desires to poll-watch at suburban polls for
Senator Douglas on election day can receive instruction and

assignments at the Monday
meeting from Frank McAd-
ams, Chicago corporation law-
yer.

Students for Douglas, under its
co-chairmen Don Cass and David
Lane, is acting as a clearing house
for volunteers who want to parti-
cipate in passing out leaflets, pre-
cinct work and poll watching on

tials of common morality, and the
other is for the preservation of
tenets for group living in society.

Maritain stressed the point that
the faith and inspiration which a
democracy needs belong to the
temporal and secular order of
earthly life, to culture and to
civilization. They are practical,
rather than theoretical, and “de-
pend on the simple, natural per-
ceptions of men.” We must be-
lieve in the absolute value of
moral good.

Maritain considers the modern-
day heretic a breaker of the com-
mon democratic beliefs and poli-
cies. In order to make the here-
tic’s influence powerless we
should set up specific agencies to
deal with him. This would necessi-
tate co-operation between men of
different faiths and political be-
liefs, in practical agreement about
the tenets of a democratic society.

Disagreement frowned upon

On the leadership level, those
who agree intellectually, but dis-
agree practically, should be pre-
vented from being leaders.

Maritain concluded by empha-
sizing that the right to dissent
should not be infringed upon by
the state, and by warning that
nothing hurts a nation more than
the weakening and breaking down
of the “internal springs of con-
science.”

No C-Dance will be held this

Case says, in describing their
purpose, “We, as well as other

noled with satisfaction that the
polls show him to be the favorite
at this time. However, we do not
know what the opposition may do
in these last days of the cam-

Therefore, we are redoubling our

efforts to get a heavy vote for
Senator Douglas on November 2."

Lab school experimental; RMH makes mistake?

-	by Jack Burbach

When Hutchins first become Chancellor of the University, an experimental class was designed in the laboratory school to deter-
mine the advisability of early admissions to the college. Thirty students were selected from the eleventh grade of the lab school to
attend a "great books" course held by the University.

Each week the students were to read one great literary work and attend a weekly discussion section.

Not knowing the inten-
tion of Choncellor Hutch-
ins, the school selected its
thirty best students, with
near genius IQ’s, to participate in
the experiment.

Not knowing the lab school’s
method of selection, Hutchins as-
sumed that the class represented
an average cross-section of elev-
enth grade students, and based
the curriculum of the college on
that assumption.

For several years thereafter the
college curriculum was such that
only the "most brilliant .of the
brilliant” could hope to absorb
it all.

This , story was told by the
school hostess, Miss Edith Shep-
pard, on the occasion of the lab
school’s addition of another year
onto their high school.

Up until this year the lab school
stopped at the end of the tenth
grade, with the most students en-
tering directly into the college the
next year.

This year because of the new
college program, a third year of
high school has been added to
its curriculum.

Since the majority of students
completing the tenth grade last
year elected to take the college
entrance tests and enter the col-
lege, rather than continue on to

the eleventh grade, this year’s
senior class is small, consisting
of about 20 students.

This change in the lab school
curriculum, which means among
other factors the addition of sci-
ence labs and third year courses in
foreign languages, illustrates the
attempt made to integrate the lab
school program with the college
and the rest of the University.

Identify with UC

Most of the students in the lab
school high school, identify them-
selves almost as closely with the
University as they do with the
high school, according to Lloyd
Urdal, lab school principal.

One of the students in the new

Ryerson tower is the spiky projection pictured last week as the mystery photograph
Maroon "Know the Quadrangles" contest, now entering its second week. The first
to reach the Maroon with the correct answer last Friday, was Bob Berthel, a student

college.

"I was thinking about it in my humanities class," Berthel

said, "and then I passed
office."

The contest, designed
their campus, features a

the place on my way to the Maroon

to find out how well UC'ers know
prize of a carton of cigarettes for

the first person who brings the correct solution to the Maroon
office (when open), or to the Reynolds club desk.

The solution consists of identifying different campus
pictured from varied points of view.

This week's mystery picture appears on the right.

Maroon staff members and their families are not eligible
for contest participation.



-AT





eleventh grade insisted that the
last year of the lab school should
be called the pre-college year,
rather than the senior year.

The addition of an eleventh year
constitutes a return to the lab
school as it existed before the
policy of early admissions was
adopts by the University in the
1930’s.

When Judd became director of
education around the turn of the
century, he firmly believed that
the eighth grade of elementary
school was one of repetition and
useless review. Acting upon this
belief, the lab school was set up
as an eleven-year school, with the
high school beginning at the com
pletion of the seventh grade.

The philosophy underlying the
lab school curriculum is the belief
that children learn by doing, and
that the best preparation for the
solving of future problems Is di-
rect experience in the solution of
immediate ones.

Make Map

In a geography class the stu-
dents were busily engaged in the
making of a relief map from flour
and salt, a project which they
themselves had planned and ini-
tiated. The teacher was giving
them a “free hand’’ in the making
of the map.

After the day’s work on the
map was completed, the students
held a discussion with the aid of
the teacher over the problem of
bow the map might be made more
easily and with fewer difficulties.

school as an eleven year school

quiet and solitude conductive to

-	by Sam Tipton

Changes in the Chicago BA have so far had no effect on
the curriculum of Shimer college, UC’s "sister college" which
has patterned itself for more than fifty years on the plan of
study taught here.

Shimer is still awarding the old BA degree. Mrs. Alma Mul-

lin, wife of the new president
assistant director of student
activities at UC, said no plans
for a change were being consid-
ered. though she did not indicate
what effect the upheavals at UC
will have on what now amounts to
the “Shimer plan.”

Mrs. Mullin agrees with former
Chancellor Hutchins’ plan of
study but does not think that his
attacks on the “country club” col-
lege activities are well founded
since she believes that these ac-

of Shimer college and former

tivities “contribute
personality but do
intellect.”

She claims that

to a person's
not effect his

Shimer stu-

dents’ access to outdoor activities,
such as horseback t iding and golf,
and the ease and simplicity of the
Shimer schedule, tend to free the
students from the “tensions and
pressure” which are a handicap
to UC students.

Describe town

Shimer. which has 130 students,
Is located in Mt. Carroll, Illinois,
a town of 2000 people. The town
has only one movie theatre and
few oilier activities. Several of
the students at Shimer inter-
viewed by rhe Maroon consider
this the worst aspect of life at
Shimer. although some of them
find the small town very interest-
ing. and say that the quietness
and solitude is conducive to study.

The buildings of the campus are
colonial in style and the campus

has lots of fiees and grass which
contribute to its air of quietness
and solitude, says the Shimer bul-
letin.

A date at Shimer might consist
of walking to the local movie, get-
ting a coke at the drugstore, and
walking back to the dormitories,
where both men and women must
sign in by 11 p.m. The students
are not allowed to live off the
campus and they are not allowed
to have automobiles.

Boys don’t date

The ratio of men to women is
8:5 but this is no disadvantage,
since a lot of the boys do not want
to go on dates as often as the
girls, said at least eight of the
Shimer men.

Some of the students at Shimer
who have attended UC or other
large colleges said that they pre-
ferred the quietness and beauty
of Shimer to the hustle and bustle
of the city. The thing that is hard-
est to do without are the cultural

facilities, such as museums and
art galleries, such students claim.

Students who are attending
Shimer can still transfer to UC
and at present there are about 30
former Shimer students here.
However, Shimer authorities indi-
ated that some difficulty would be
found by UC students who at-
tempt to transfer to Shimer. if
they are enrolled under the new
plan. These difficulties would re-
sult because some of the special-

Shimer college became affiliat-
ed with UC in 1896 and the affilia-
tion was renewed and strength-
ened in the spring of 1950, accord-
ing 1o the Shimer bulletin. This
closed affiliation made Shimer’s
< urricuhim almost identical to
UC’s and Shimer’s bulletin claims
it has found a solution to the
"problem of education for free-
dom.”

grades, but rather eleven years of
schooling.

Combine Grades

What would normally be the
first and second grades arc com
bined in what arc called primary
groups. In each of these 25 six-
and seven year-olds ork and play
together.

Such an arrangement is design
ed to permit the two age groups
to engage in activities of common
interest, at the same time permit-
ting differentiated instruction in
some subjects to provide for vari-
ations in Individual maturity.

The reading groups arc not split
up on the basis of age. but on the
basis of individual accomplish-
ment and ability. In some of the
groups the children are doing well
to distinguish between w o r d s ,
white in others they are asking all
sorts of questions about the simv.

Describe Seating

In the primary groups. Instead
of the teacher’s desk being located
in the front of the room, with the
children’s benches facing it in
even rows, the seats were ar
ranged in any number of different
ways, and the teacher’s desk
might be found almost anywhere
in the room.

In one class the teacher's desk
was not in the classroom at all,
and the teacher appeared to spend
most of her time sitting on the
floor in the midst of little groups
of children.

The children were permitted to
engage in conversation with one
another, in many cases the in-
structor encouraged such conver-
sation. In one reading group the
children asked more questions of
one another than they did of the
teacher.

In order to promote class par-
ticipation. the school devotes sev-
eral periods a week in the lower
school classes to “see and tell’
periods, in which the children am
asked to bring things to class
which they display and explain to
their classmates. Objects brought
might range from a map of Africa
to a superman comic book oi a
teddy bear.

Accelerate Program

There are no seventh or eighth
grades in the lab school. What
would normally be the seventh
grade is the pre freshman class of
the upper school. What normally
would be the eighth grade is the
freshman class, and so on.

The student “skips” no grade's
in this system/ Rather, the cur-
curiculum is so planed that he
completes by the end of the pre-
freshrnan year what is normally
completed by the end of the eighth
grade in public schools.

The lab school’s student coun-
cil is one of the oldest high school

Hoelscher, director of student ac-
tivities at the lab school, the coun-
cil may even be granted, by a
unique clause in its charter, the
power to control and operate any
area of the school ordinarily han-
dled by the faculty, if the students
demostrate their ability to do so.

Morgenthau examines reasons Enrollment up ten per cent in

for loss of prestige in Europe

overall increase; reverse trend

by Fred Freed

Governmental security policies, poor leadership within the American government, and
lack of interest in US foreign aid programs, were pinpointed as the three major causes of
Ilie tragic loss of American prestige in Western Europe by Hans Morgenthau, professor in
I he department of political sciences, at last Sunday’s meeting of the Calvert club.

Comparing his Western European trip last summer to a similar trip in 1951, Morgenthau
;aid, “No one could fail to be impressed and shocked by the loss of American prestige in

Europe.

Three years ago, we were
not liked, but we were uni-
versally respected, stated Morgen-
thau. Now, however, the US is
being treated with derision and
contempt. “Nothing is more fatal
than a great power’s not being
taken seriously ... in fact, being
made fun of. In the eyes of Euro
peans, the United States is now
in that position,” he said.

Our foreign aid programs have
been nothing more than “blood
transfusions,” he criticized, and
have not effected the economic
and social organizations of the
countries receiving aid. The great
mass of the people in these coun-
tries want changes of this nature.
Our apparent opposition to these
changes has caused a great deal
of anti-American feeling.

Shatter faith I

Recent security measures,
looked upon by many in this coun-
try with pride, have shaken Euro-
pean faith in the American gov-
ernment and its policies. Morgen-
thau continued. The McCarran
act. the absence of “controver-
sial literature” in American over-
seas libraries, and the suspension
of obvious anti-Communists as
“security risks” are among the
security policies that worry Euro-
peans.

Europeans have come to regard
us, as they regarded Russia a
few years ago, as the main ob-
stacle to world peace, asserted
Morgenthau. They are confirmed
in this opinion by the complete
lack of leadership within the
American government.

Much of this loss in prestige
began with the Marshall plan and
similar aid programs which failed
to change the distribution of so-
cial and economic power in west-
ern European countries. By keep-
ing the ruling classes in these

countries in power, we appear to
be opposed to changes from the
status quo, Morgenthau main-
tained. Especially in France and
Italy, the people strongly desire
the changes that we appear to
oppose.

“We are pursuing or at least
appearing to pursue a counter-
revoluntionary policy. This is a
losing position from the begin-
ning,” he said. “We should have
a been little more openly self-
interested. We should-have made

Photo by Cooper
Hans Morgenthau

it clear that we had interests to
preserve that happen to coincide
with the interests of the countries
concerned.” Morgenthau added
that we should have shown that
these interests coincide with those
of the exploited groups in these
countries. As it is, we appear to
be following an aimless policy,
and we are ridiculed for spending
so much money with no ques-
tions asked.

Deterioration, evident

The security policies of our gov-

ernment have lead to a drastic
deterioration of American gen-
eral foreign policy in recent years,
according to Morgenthau. The
technical competence of the for-
eign service has dropped because
of these policies.

“When an effective anti-Com-
munist is removed as a security
ri»k, a moral shadow is cast on
the very character of the Ameri-
can government, and society . . .
There is an element of madness in
our security policies. A madness
of consistency.”

SF debate team
meets 16 others

Student Forum members

will

debate teams from 16 colleges at
the seventh annual Purdue invita-
tional forensic conference this
weekend.

This is contrary to the report in
last week’s Maroon which stated
that the Purdue conference would
be held last weekend.

Among the 16 universities to be
represented are Notre Dame, Pur-
due, US Military Academy, Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, and Univer-
sity of Utah.

The UC debaters selected
from Forum members to repre-
sent the affirmative on the topic,
“Resolved: That the US should ex-
tend recognition to Communist
China,” are Donald McClintock
and Roger Bowen. Upholding the
negative will be Edward Renshaw
and Joseph Engel. John Merrill
will serve as discussion leader and
Marvin Phillips, director of For-
um. will be critic-judge.

Following the Purdue tourna-
ment, UC debaters will meet
teams from Northwestern. Brad-
ley, and University of Michigan.

Total enrollment in the Univer-
sity this year is up ten per cent
over last year. This increase, ac-
cording to William E. Scott, Uni-
versity registrar, reverses the
trend that has plagued the Uni-
versity since 1948.

Enrollment on the quadrangles
is up two per cent over 1953-54
figures, while enrollment in uni-
versity college is up nearly 37 per
cent over last year.

Although the final matricula-
tion figures will not be available
till the end of the quarter, Scott
attributes the change to a general
increase in the number of new

Chancellor Lawrence A.
Kimpton has been appointed

of the music department, and Dr.
J. Garrott Allen of the depart-

will also submit candidates for
awards to the national committee.

Fulbright awards are both grad-

western Europe, the middle east,
and the far east. Deadline for ap-

students entering all areas of the
University.

The total enrollment of the Uni-
versity stands at just under 7000.
Enrollment on the quadrangles is
4713 as compared with 4615 en-
rolled last year.

Of these 1336 are enrolled in
undergraduate programs, and
3377 are enrolled in the divisions
and graduate schools. The latter
figure includes those persons who
are working on two or three year
masters programs who have not
yet completed the requirements
for a bachelor degree.

Enrollment in the law school,
divinity school, social service ad-
ministration, and medical school
is up. Enrollment in the school of
business is about the same, and
enrollment in the graduate library
school show's a slight decrease
over last year.

Enrollment figures in the col-
lege and the divisions are com-
plicated by the new' BA programs,
but taken together they show an
increase of about fifty students
over last year.

Gray explains views on
US-Soviet exchange

The Labor Youth league couple
which accused me in last week’s
Maroon of spouting a “student
version of the old canard pushed
by the generals” has done me a
big favor: should I ever try to
get into Government service, such
a statement ought to establish
my anti - Communist credentials
for good. However, I would not
take up Maroon space to express
my gratitude to the Barons, were
it not for the fact that SRP has
attempted to spread confusion
around the campus by publicizing
a very similar misinterpretation
of my views and those of other
ISL delegates to the NSA Con-
gress.

The minority party has under-
taken to print in the form of a
poster a sentence from last April’s
ISL platform supporting the prin-
ciple of student exchange with all
countries, including Iron Curtain
ones. But in attempting to show
how this allegedly conflicts with
the stand we took at the NSA
Congress opposing a. particular
minority resolution on Soviet ex-
change, they omit the following
sentence, in which we stated then
that international understanding
through the exchange of ideas
should be the indispensible pre-
requisite of any NSA-sponsored
student exchange.

The minority resolution at the
NSA Congress, since it stated
support of Soviet exchange with
no strings attached and no pre-
requisites established, would have
indicated blind acceptance by NSA
of exchange as an end in itself.
It would have pointed to NSA’s
inability to understand that ex-
change programs are not always
successful, that misunderstand-
ing is sometimes their result. It
would have prevented NSA from
negotiating with Soviet student
groups in order to obtain condi-
tions of exchange favorable to
extensive person-to-person contact
among students of our countries;
for if NSA insisted on such con-
ditions. and the Soviets did not
feel their own best interests would
be served by this type of contact,
the minority resolution would
have forced NSA to accede to the
Soviet plans.

A far better resolution, in our
opinion, was the one actually
passed by the Congress support-

Richard E. Ward

managing editor

ing exchange with all countries
on the basis of certain minimal
conditions for attained communi-
cation of ideas. This does not ex-
clude Soviet Russia; it simply
gives NSA a bargaining position
for setting up a type of Soviet
exchange that will be fruitful.

The SRPers’ inability to think
through this problem in other
than extreme categories has pre-
vented them from understanding
our viewpoint. This scarcely gives
them the right to pronounce us
as liars all over campus.

Contests SG election
committee decision

The ISL majority on the elec-
tion and rules committee has com-
mitted a gross injustice in refus-
ing to slate Gerald Seifert in this
election. Mr. Seifert was “disquali-
fied” as a candidate for SG (Col-
lege) by a vote of 3 to 1; I voted
against the move.

Now let the reader judge—here
are the facts in this case: Mr.
Seifert has been a full-time stu-
dent at this University for three
quarters. He has, however, never
taken a “Comp.” The reason for
this is that Mr. Seifert, who has
a family to support, left Chicago
before “Comps” last Spring in
order to take a well-paying job in
another part of the country. An
exception was made in his case^y
the college administration. Whep
he returned to school this Fall he
was classified by the college as a
“student in good standing,” de-
spite the fact that he had never
taken a “Comp.”

The requirement in the election
code of a 2.0 grade average for
candidates was to insure that only
students with good academic
standings would participate in
SG. Now clearly Mr. Seifert’s
academic standards are good in
the eyes of the administration, or
they wouldn’t have made an excep-
tion in his case and allowed him
to return to school this Fall with-
out having taken his “Comps.”
Yet the ISL majority disqualified
him as a candidate because “no
matter what you say he still does-
n’t have a 2.0 average!”

Further the ISL majority re-
fused to consider Mr. Seifert’s
quarterly grades on the grounds
that only “Comp.” grades count!
These non-existent grades didn’t
count in the eyes of the college
administration, but they did count

for the partisan ISL majority of
the E & R committee.

I think that this majority—
intent on winning at any cost—
has been highly unfair in denying
the spirit of the law for their
overtly strict and discriminatory
word of the law. What do you
think?

Find discriminatory
housing near UC

We three, law students and
over twenty-one, arrived in Chi-
cago on the 18th of September
and began apartment hunting that
very evening.

By October 1st, all that our
search had netted us was a dank
cellar which we had to vacate
because our landlord discovered
that his wife had rented it with-
out looking too closely at’ the
skin color of one of us.

At present, two of us are liv-
ing in a place large enough to
accommodate three and the third

has located himself in an-
other basement. The three of us
cannot live together under the
same roof because the manage-
ment will not permit tenants to
shelter a Negro.

We are angry; angry at our
former landlord, angry at the
thousand and one other landlords,
realtors, and property owners who
refused to admit us because we
were “mixed tenants.” Moreover,
we are furious at a simple and dis-
arming idea called “saving the
community.” Saving the commu-
nMy? That means, “Keep out all
those who are unstable, unreli-
able, and undesirable, to wit:
Negroes, students, and parents
with young children, so that our
children and property will be safe
from contamination.”

Our experience is over now. We
are embittered, saddened and bur-
dened by our newly acquired
knowledge. We offer no solution,
fof a solution awaits the day when
the University becomes aware of
the type of off-campus residence
available to its students, Negro
and white. Until this realization
comes about we can only offer a
caveat to those secure in the
knowledge that all is for the best:
Beware of the world outside—it
harbors some frightening reali-
ties.

Formosa policy
dangerous, poor

The concern I feel about-our
present policy regarding Formosa,
is, I believed, shared by most
Americans and virtually all of our
Allies abroad. I’ should like to
state the reasoning which leads
me to believe that it is a danger-
ous and foolish policy.

First, no one knows how far it
goes. There is-every reason to
suspect that our government will
wait for the moment of invasion
before finally deciding how much
support we are going to give. But
since we shall then be already
involved in hostilities the decision
is likely to be based on the angry
emotion of the moment rather
than on careful reflection.

The presence of our fleet be-
tween Formosa and the mainland
means that we may get ourselves
drawn into the Chinese civil war
in its last stages. Let it be remem-
bered that this is merely the last
battle of that civil war. But clear-
ly if there ever was a justifica-
tion for us to intervene, which is

very doubtful, the time to do so
has long passed. No one would
suggest that intervention today
could alter the basic outcome of
that war. We should be wasting
the lives of our servicemen for
the sake of saving “face.” I do
not think this is a sufficient justi-
fication.

In my opinion this policy of
stubborn clinging to a lost posi-
tion is characteristic of our gov-
ernment’s responsible to the com-
munist menace. The rigidity and
the short sightedness of this re-
sponse results largely from the
fear that a more flexible and in-
telligent policy will be denounced
in Congress as a “Sell Out” as
even as “Treason.” Such wild ac-
cusations have lately become the
fashion. Thus the atmosphere gen-
erated by McCarthyism has had
extremely dangerous effects upon
American foreign policy.

We should have the moral cour-
age to admit fnistakes by with-
drawing our fleet from Formosa
and letting the Nationalists de-
fend their last stronghold as best
they can. We should concentrate
on economic, social, and only as a
last resort, military aid to the un-
derdeveloped nations which may
still be saved from communist
domination. Still more important
we should seek especially to
strengthen those nations, such as
India and Indonesia, which, un-
like the Chinese nationalists, rep-
resent democracy and freedom in
Asia — and we should do this
whether or not these nations are
willing to gear the details of their
foreign policies to our every wish.

Compares Soviet
exchange with
Yugoslav visit

I have followed with interest
the Maroon debates on Soviet-
American student exchange. I
think Paula and Harold Baron’s
letter was a gross misrepresenta-
tion of Clive Gray’s position. Mr.
Gray seems primarily concerned
that student exchange be effected
in accordance with the principles
set forth by the NSA, especially
“free exchange of ideas between
free agents.” However, it is the
validity of this principle that I
seriously question when applied
to Communist countries. It just
isn’t possible.

The issues then become: to what
extent does regimentation of the
visits lessen their value, and to
what extent does the difference
in mentality throw up a barrier?
Should these rule out any ex-
change?

While studying in Geneva, I
participated in a Swiss-Yugoslav
exchange in the spring of 1951.
Owing to its pressing need for
Western currency, Yugoslavia
was making its first bids for
Western tourists. The visit was
tightly organized to impress us
favorably. It was easy to see be-
hind the gloss, e.g., large servings
of meat twice a day when the
average ration was one serving
per week. Our student hosts in
the university cities of Ljubljana,
Zagreb and Sarajevo ran the
gamut from zealots for the regime
(the leaders of our activities), to
mild enthusiasts, to indifference.
The latter participated only be-
cause they had a good knowledge
of French or German.

Open friendliness plus Marxist
mentality was indeed a challenge.
The Yugoslavs were intent that
we should see and appreciate new
factories, hospitals, workers’ and
students’ housing, and other bene-
fits of the new society. They were

surprised when we also wanted
to visit the old parts of Zagreb
and its beautiful Gothic cathedral.
For these vestiges of Renaissance
art, they had only scorn. To the
Marxists, it was both inevitable
and seriable that the old (the
“ugly”) should give way to the
modern (the “beautiful”). Never-
theless, I feel our appreciation
of the old made some impression.

When visiting a large, new chil-
dren’s home where well-fed, well-
dressed babies up to three years
old were being cared for, a Marx-
ist girl said to me, “Isn’t it won-
derful that their mothers are free
to work for the state?” My reac-
tion “But what blank, expres-
sionless faces these tots have!
Don't they need a mother’s inter-
est to bring out their personali-
ties?” We didn’t reach agreement,
but I'm sure my point of view at
least registered with her.

Genuine good fellowship was
had at one evening party when
the Yugoslavs sang and danced
for us to their native songs.

It’s difficult to estimate the
distance covered when people be-
gin poles apart. “Free exchange”
can only be sifted through the
hard shell of indoctrination en-
closing the minds of Communist
students. But let’s not underesti-
mate the importance of the few
chips that might be chiseled off
this shell by contacts with West-
ern students. As for the propa-
ganda such visits might provide,
I'm sure our refusal to admit the
Russian students who applied for
American visas provided very rich
propaganda!

Maroon errs, more
persons in personnel

May I bring your attention to
two errors in last week’s article
about Personnel office. During
the past nine months the Person-
nel office has processed not 1,500
persons, but 1.500 students alone
and expects to serve over 2,000
by the end of the year. Aside
from students the Personnel of-
fice has processed over 4,500 non-
student applicants over this
period.

Your article also implied that
all'full-time, non-academic appli-
cants are handled only by Miss
Farrelly, whereas, in actuality.
Miss Farrelly is only one of four
interviewers who process non-
student applicants.

I would appreciate It if you
would correct these errors.

Over one-half of the writers rep-
resented in the Autumn issue of
the Chicago Review, due to ap-
pear November 15, are, or were
recently, students at UC.

Among the stories to be found
in this issue will be: “The Day It
Snowed,” by Phil Roth, a new stu-
dent; “The Oil,” by a famous Ital-
ian author, G. A. Gorgese, trans-
lated by a UC student; and “The
Devil Below Stairs,” by Barbara
Howes, who has previously ap-
peared in Atlantic and the New
Yorker.

A former UC student, Jascha
Kessler, has contributed a sports
story, “Tournament,” which he
wrote while teaching at New York
Univ^sity.

Included in the Review’s poetry
section will be poems by Paul
Kinnell and Barbara Gabor. Book
reviews will be handled by stu-
dents Matt Phillips, Mark Nugent
and Sydney Harth.

Elder Olson, associate professor
of English and author of a recent
book on the poetry of Dylan
Thomas, will have a critical essay
on two modern poets. Kenneth
Burke will be represented by a
work dealing with the symbolism
in Goethe’s "Faust.”

John J. McDonough, vice-presi-
dent of the Harris trust and sav-

man of the board of directors of
the University o'f Chicago alumni

Through the foundation, which
last year was headed by Earle

678 to the University for the 1954
annual alumni gift.

tempted to express the emotional
experience of humanity as a
whole rather than the personal
emotions of the artist himself.
Delattre correlated the rise of
existentialism in art with the rise
of French impressionism, citing
Cezanne as the pioneer of artistic
existentialism.

There is further as antithesis,
he continued, between existent ial-
istic artists and those abstract
artists who are too preoccupied
with design to center their atten-
tion upon personality. He cited
Van Gogh and Picasso as fine ex-
amples of existentialistic art: Van
Gogh because, in “Starry Night,”
for example, the anguish evident
in each stroke betrays the artist’s
personal feeling about the night
and God; Picasso because his
Guarnica mural exemplifies
“Christian existentialism,” with
only God providing relief from
the anguish and suffering ex-
pressed therein.

Basically, then, Delattre’s view
of existentialism in art is that it
portrays a personalized human
emotion; and that there is a dan-
ger in the contemporary artis’s
losing the human relationship
which the existentialist considers
of foremost importance.

The next lecture in this series is
scheduled for next Thursday,
when John B. Thompson, dean of
Rockefeller Chapel, will speak on
“The existentialism of Sartre and
Cadmus,” followed on November
4 by Perry D. LeFevre of the fed-
erated theological faculty'on “Ex-
istentialism in recent Christian
thought.”

DocFilm portrays horror of war
Creates real and powerful effect

All Quiet on the Western Front, shown last Friday by the Documentary Film group as
the first of its “war” series, was to this viewer a very powerful film. What made it so was
essentially that cherished artistic quality, a direct representation of experience.

Adapted from the novel by Erich Remarque, the narrative concerns a class of World War
I German schoolboys, who, aroused by the patriotic fire of their professor, enthusiastically
enlisted. Their enthusiasm is dampened by the first fall in the mud, and almost immediately

they are sent to the front.

The scenes of the boys’ first
contact with the fighting por-
tray the strain of their disorien-
tation. Some of the new soldiers,
shut in a small barricade, inactive
under unceasing bombardment,
break down completely. Most of
the soldiers, sitting behind ma-
chine guns, watching lines of
enemy go down, merely gape in
amazement.

Their amazement is at the re-
duction of all values to those of
li e and death, or more accurately
to those of living and dying—for
there is no life at the front. Their
amazement is at the meaningless-
ness and nothingness of the pa-
triotism that brought them here,
for patriotism instilled merely by
fiery speeches is false and cannot
exist in war. Their amazement,
finally, is the realization that con-
trol of their fate is completely re-
moved from their hands, and that
each one of them is trivial and un-
important, submerged in this in-
cc mprehensible struggle.

Universal message

What makes for the directness
and power here is the picture of
an objectively real situation, with-
out any individual characters
st inding out and detracting our
attention. The experience itself
is the essential thing, and the re-
sponse to it is that of a bunch of
soldiers, just out of training, re-
sponding with the simple, univer-
sal. human fear of war.

We see, as the film proceeds,
the emergence of a main charac-
ter in whom these universal traits
are concentrated. In the scenes
that follow, he gropes for re-
minders of life, for remains of
the positive orientation he once
knew. The soldier, Paul, is par-

ticularly saddened by the death
of a wounded comrade, in the hos-
pital with an amputated leg.
Though he has seen countless
corpses, this occasion becomes a
testament to his earlier life with
his schoolmates. Together they
visit their stricken comrade, and
Paul remains with him till his
death, clinging to the last vestiges
of the atmosphere of a former
life.

Likewise, in an incident with a
French village girl, Paul forgets
the ardors of his army life and is
soothed by this human contact,
and he says to the girls, in effect:
I will never forget you. You have
helped me remember what it is
like to live.

Alienated from home

Later, on a leave. Paul returns
to his family, his town. He feels
himself an alien. Childhood relics
arouse no sentiments in him and
he listens affectionately but com-
passionately to his mother’s pa-
thetic advice.

He returns to his old school-
room and interrupts his old pro-
fessor in a lecture similar to the
one which induced him to enlist.
He shakes his head, and after be-
ing urged to speak, he reluctantly
tells the class that what the pro-
fessor has been saying is untrue,
that army life is unromantic, un-
dramatic and difficult. The class
shouts out that he is a coward.

Paul, thus finding his earlier
bonds severed, returns from his
leave sooner than necessary. Most
of his buddies and schoolmates
having been killed, he is alone.

The film ends with a last, touch-
ing echo. Paul, oblivious of his
surroundings, reaches from his
trench for a large, beautiful but-
terfly and is killed. Such simple,
intense, human desires cannot be
annihilated, but All Quiet on the

Western Front shows that in war,
neither can they be fulfilled. -^

Acting sincere

The acting, though not striking
in any way, was effective. It was
natural, straightforward, and per-
sistently sincere, without drama
or ornamentation; the effect was
that of a quiet, level voice plead-
ing, “Don’t you see how it really
is?”

Even the inferior technical pro-
cesses of 1930 (when the film was
produced* do not interfere with
the absorbing effect. In fact, it is
doubtful to this viewer .that any-
one could not have ben moved by
this directness, particularly any-
one who is soon to face the experi-

ence of war

himself.

First fall concert of the year to feature

Pete Seeger, Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry

Pete Seeger with his five string banjo, Big Bill Broonzy with his guitar, and Sonny Terry
with his blues harmonica will appear on October 30 at Mandel hall for the first folk concert
of the year. Tickets are on sale at $1 and $1.50.

Seeger, a native New Englander, performed twice on campus last year. In 1939 he left
school and began a trek across the U.S. to learn and revive the art of banjo playing. Togeth-
er with the Dust Bowl balladeer, Woody Guthrie, he learned picking techniques from Ten-
nessee farmers, Louisiana

boatmen, and Kansas plains-
men. Since that time Seeger
has played for union meetings,
performed in New York’s Wash-
ington Square and Chicago’s
Pump Room, recorded for the
Library of Congress and made
hundreds of commercial record-
ings. More recently he has worked
with the “Weavers,” made a docu-
mentary film To Hear My Banjo
Flay, and recorded for Stinson
and Folkways. He is regarded as
one of America’s unique musi-
cians.

Musical society gives
well-planned concert

The first in its current season of chamber music concerts
was presented last Saturday evening by the University of
Chicago musical society in Ida Noyes library. The atmosphere
was ideal for the type of music presented, and the audience
was large and appreciative.

Careful planning wfts evident, for the program was both

consistently interesting and
well performed. Though de-
voted entirely to music by
living composers, it covered a
time span of nearly fifty years -

Big Bill Broonzy is a blues gui-
tarist in the Blind “Lemon” Jef-
ferson tradition. He learned his
music on the streets of' Little
Rock, and later with men like
H u d i e “Leadbelly” Learbetter,
Jefferson, Blind Boy Fuller, and
Jelly Roll Morton. Leadbelly said
of Broonzy, that he “was born
with the blues.” Years of associa-
tion with the above-named artists
gave polish to his easy rambling
style. He is currently running a
bar at 36th and Cottage Grove,
where he plays with a three-piece

sic throughout the year, and it
welcomes student participation.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

UT to present
Qiraudoux’s play
‘The Enchanted’

Jean Giraudoux’s The Enehanf-
,d has been called by French and
American critics ".. . provocative,
subtle, evocative, fantastic, witty,
moody, but always and most of
all theatrical.” University theatre
is now rehearsing this seldom
staged French fantasy.

"Giraudoux’s characters are dif-
ficult to portray,” stated Marvin
Phillips, UT director. "The sym-
bolism of fantasy, the poetry, the
half-real, half-imaginary charac-
ters produce an elusiveness that
only the imagination can cap-
ture.”

The play's protagonist, 1 h e
Idealistic, beautiful Isabelle will
be played by Neva Fowler, Her
lover, "the adventurer of the
flesh,” is Omar Shapli. An inspec-
tor and a mayor, to be played by
George Wcllwarth and Fredric
Hirsch, respectively, plus a ghost,
little girls and executioners add to
the cast of fifteen. Carol Horning
and Laurie Richardson play a pair
of gossiping old maids.

Rehearsals will continue for
four weeks with the final produc-
tion, to be staged in-the-round.
scheduled for November 19, 20, 21
in the Reynolds club theatre.

Chekov's ’Sea Gull'
given by Playrights

“The Sea Gull,” a tragi-comedy by Anton Chekov, will open
Tuesday at the Playwrights' theatre club. It will he under the
direction of Paul Sills.

Performances are at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday,
7 and 7:30 p.m. Sunday. Information and reservations can be

obtained by calling Whitehall 3

The play, which is consid-
ered one of the Russian play-
wright’s two or three master-
pieces, was recently done at the
Phoenix Theatre, off Broadway in
New York, and was considered
one of the most admirable produc-
tions of the year.

It deals with a group of people
who are part of a decaying and
selfish class, some of them trying
to be great, some of them trying
to remain young. But their ideas,
their characteristics, and their
cruelties force two of the sensi-
tive members of the new genera-
tion to tragic ends, one for trying
io live with the decay, the other
for not completely understanding
it and for fighting it within him-
self. Chekov, the master of char-
acterization, h a s created here
many well - remembered people
who are at once personalities and
symbols of the end of one age and
the beginning of another.

Zohra Alton, a feature actress
at the Playwrights’ theatre, will
be seen this time as Masha, taking

she is in mourning for her life.
Antony Holland, last seen in Peer
Gynt, and a student at UC will
play Constantin Treplev, t h e
young playwTight who is troubled
by the ruin about him. Others in
the cast are Edward Asner. Lee
Henry, Donna Hoabird, Byrne
Piven, and Joyce Hiller.

Playwrights theatre club is the
offshoot of a former UC group,
‘Tonight at 8:30,” and many of
its members are former students.
After an uncertain beginning
Playwrights is now on firm
ground. They are an established,
competent group of professional
actors and their previous produc-
tions have received wide acclaim
in Chicago’s newspapers.

Nazi war proganda film
given in DocFilm series

A propaganda film record of the Nurenberg conference
held in September, 1934, w ill be offered by the documentary
Film group this evening as the second in its series of studies
in the war film.

The picture, entitled Triumph of the Will, was made by
Hitler’s blonde lady friend Leni Reifenstahl as a demonstra-

tion to the German people of
Nazism’s greatness and of the
magnificent brilliance of Ger-
many's leaders, especially "der

Fuehrer.”

and the remaining three films of
the series: Grand Illusion t Re-

Starting with Hitler's arrival
by plane in Nurenberg and with

his tumultuous ovation by
swarms of his people, "Triumph

the cunning methods of the Nazis
in dealing with the masses. Every
word, ever gesture, every move-
ment of the rulers is photo-
graphed with discernment and
for the best effects possible. Ac-
tual newsreel film is re arranged
and distorted. And the immedi-
ate. stunning mob response to its
leaders’ speeches serves to illus-
trate the demagogue's control
over the mass mind.

Fewer attend, universities

(from page 1)
intellectual quality in the conver-
sations of the people at these uni-
versities, indicating that speciali-
zation does not limit their capac-
ity for appreciation of general
educational subjects, he said. .

The continental universities
have a far more limited extra-
curricular life than in England
or the United States. Kimpton
thought. “A university is a group
of lecture rooms and laboratories
.. . The life of a student is not the
university’s business.” At the Uni-
versity of Paris there were no
dorms, and the students live all
over Paris, he said. At Lyons there
is university housing, but no or-
ganized activity centers around
these dorms at all.

Oxford housing rugged

Kimpton remarked that at Ox-
ford the housing for the students
is rugged, with no central heating
and a minimum of bathrooms.
“They eat well, however.” he said.

Kimpton asked someone at Ox-
ford about the tradition of not
washing windows which is upheld
in the Hutchinson Commons on
the UC campus. “We don’t wash
windows, but we haven’t thought
cf it is a tradition,” he told Kimp-
ton. “We just don’t get around
to it,” he said.

Impressed with Munich

At the University of Munich.
Kimpton was impressed with the
“liveliness” of the student body.
H e said, “The students at Munich
speak ‘American.’ not English,
and they are proud of their abil-
ity to do so.”

UC’s exchange university, the
University of Frankfurt, was not
in session when Kimpton visited
there, and he saw very few peo-
ple. However, he did see quite a
bit of the campus and was im-
pressed by the school.

German universities in general
suffered during the war as a
result of the bombing. Kimpton
found. “However, they have been
rebuilt at an amazing rate,” he
said, “although their lab facilities
do not begin to compare with ours
yet.”

Germans cordial to Americans

The Germans were extremely
cordial to visiting Americans. In
France and Italy on the other
hand. Kimpton found much anti-
American sentiment. “In Switzer-
land,” he stated, “any tourist is
welcome as long as his dollars
hold out.” Although they, too, are
very cordial to tourists, a com-
mercial overtone exists in all of
their dealings with visitors.

The number of people who go
on to “higher education” in Eng-
land and on the continent is pro-
portionally much less than in the
US, Kimpton found. “This is due
more to a difference in mores in
these countries than anything
else.” he stated. “Although a
‘bright’ young Britisher is pushed

Forum debates
China recognition

On Wednesday night there was
a debate at the Student Forum
office as part of the preparation
for the tournament at Purdue this
weekend. The topic debated was
“Resolved that the United States
Should Extend Diplomatic Rec-
ognition to the Communist Gov-
ernment of China.”

For the affirmative Donald Mc-
Clintock and Roger Bowen argued
that a policy of non-recognition
by the United State was frowned
upon by the free nations of Asia
and hurts our attempt to fight
Communism there. Joe Engel and
Edward Renshaw for the negative
contended that our stand against
Communism would in fact be
weakened, since recognition
would be a confession of weak-
ness and admission of defeat in
Korea.

Much of the debate was spent
trying to determine whether or
not recognition implied approval
of Chinese internal affairs with
the affirmative maintaining that
it did not. Following the debate
there were questions and criti-
cism by members of the audience.

very hard to continue his educa-
tion through scholarships and
other forms of aid, there is not
the overwhelming desire for a
person to get an education at a
university such as you find in the
U. S."

In Italy Kimpton found all of
the universities he visited closed
for the summer or “holiday.”

Spent time at U. of Paris

In France he spent some time
at the University of Paris. He
stated that in France all of the
universities are state institutions
which charge a very nominal tui-
tion. “All the professors are under
civil service,” he said, “and in
general their pay is extremely
low , . . The only way that these
professors can survive economic-
ally is to hold two or three joint
professorships.”

Also, when a professor becomes
competent enough he i^ generally
offered a position at the Sorbonne
(the University of Parisi, accord-
ing to Kimpton. This advance-
ment of professors is bad for the
smaller provincial university, but
they manage to keep fairly good
faculties anyway. “This is an
acute form of the American cus-
tom,” he said.

The Kimptons’ visits to the vari-
ous universities were completely
informal and unplanned. In gen-
eral they arrived at a university
unannounced. “By- making our
tour during the summer and ar-
riving without formalities we
were able to avoid most of the
proctocol involved in visiting
European education institutions,”
the Chancellor said.

Faculties found friendly

Even where Kimpton found
schools in session he noticed that
the faculties were never too busy
to extend hospitality to him and
his wife. “In this country we al-
ways seem busy.” he stated.

The Kimptons traveled second-
class on their trip, because they
prefered that mode of travel. “We
were much more comfortable as
second - class passengers,” Kimp-
ton remarked, “and we met many
interesting people on the ship.”

The Chancellor and his wife
rented a car and drove through
most of the countries which they
visited.

Gives impressions of UC

Asked about his impressions of
the UC campus this year, Kimp-
ton said. “I have to confess that
I’m very pleased that our enroll-
ment is up. The faculty morale is
high ... I feel a new tone on the
campus somehow. I think the Uni-
versify looks very good.”

He added that the budget was
balanced last year. “Our new un-
dergraduate program is begin-
ning with a minimum of sand in
its gears.” he said.

Kimpton stated further that
the neighborhood rehabilitation
program is moving along, but that
there was still a lot of work re-
maining to make the neighbor-
hood a pleasant one for the Uni
versity community.

Vaughan-Williams,..

(from page 1)
development of a great composer.
Emphasizing that such a com-
poser does not come of himself
but is the result of a long period
of experiment and gradual devel-
opment, he reiterated the defini-
tion of a genius as the “right man,
in the right place, at the right
time,” and thus showed the neces-
sity, for the fostering of great
music, of a general musical cul-
ture and tradition. Just as Bach,
Beethoven, and Wagner were such
men, at the ends of long periods
of development; as Purcell and
Sullivan were gifted composers,
handicapped in the first case by
being too early and in the second
by Victorian inhibitions; and as
Van Gogh was a great painter in
spite of his ignorance of anatomy
and perspective, and not because
of it; so the next great composer
is sure to appear in the place and
time best suited to receive him.

This, Vaughan • Williams sum-
med up, is the meaning and signif-
cance of a background or founda-
tion of musical culture.

Poster Vetoed

A poster addressed to “News-
men and Newshens” seeking staff
members for a proposed new cam-
pus-community newspaper was
vetoed for display on UC bulletin
boards Wednesday by William
Birenbaum. director ot student
activities.

A similar poster had been pre-

Scott, registrar and assistant dean
of students, during August when
Scott was the highest ranking
member of the administration on
campus.

At that time Scott declined to

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Page 11

footers burst Boilermakers, 3-0

Purdue's boilermakers couldn’t
contain the steam generated by
the visiting Chicago soccer team
hist Saturday. The hoosiers blew
up to the point of allowing three
VC goals while they themselves
went scoreless.

Chicago’s first goal was set up
bv Stanley John and executed per-
fectly by Bruce Colby with a shot
that burst across the goal line
from right to left, against all of
Purdue’s pre-game stress calcula-
tions. The boilermakers rallied to
patch their defense after the first
quarter explosion, but their mend-
ing only held until the third quar-
ter.

Tn that quarter Bill Vanderbyl
lofted a pretty twenty-yard kick
that hung in the air until it
reached the top opposite corner of

the goal posts, where it dipped
down and in for the second Ma-
roon score. Three minutes later
Colby, unsatisfied with one goal,
set himself up on the right side of
the Purdue goal and scored with
another cross-goal shot.

That was the final scoring of
the game.

Purdue suffered for lack of
teamwork throughout the contest.
Several of their South American
players looked very good individ-
ually, but couldn’t work together
enough to place a solid front be-
fore the Chicago attack. The Ma-
roons. on the other hand, usually
had the right player in the right
place at the right time. This was
the first Midwest Conference
game for the hooters. They have
Wheaton, Earlham, and Indiana

WHAT EVERY YOUNG COED SHOULD WEAR

Gather round, girls. Snap open a pack of Philip Morris, light up,
relax and enjoy that mild fragrant vintage tobacco while Old Dad
tells you about the latest campus fashions.

The key word*this year is casual. Be casual. Be slapdash. Be rakish.
Improvise. Invent your own ensembles—like ski pants with a peek-
a-boo blouse, like pajama bottoms with an ermine stole, like a hocky
sweater with a dirndl.

(Dirndl, incidentally, is one of the truly fascinating words in the
English language. Etymologists have quarreled over its origin for
years. Some hold with Professor Manley Ek that Dirndl is a corrup-
tion of Dardanelle and is so named because it resembles the skirts
worn by the women of that region. This theory is at first glance
plausible, but begins to fall apart when you consider that there are
no women in the Dardanelle region because of the loathesome local
custom of female infanticide.)

(Another theory is advanced by Dr. Clyde Feh. Dirndl, says he,
is a contraction of “dairy in the dell” and refers to the milkmaidish
appearance of the skirt. But again close examination causes one to
abandon a plausible hypothesis. As every child knows, it is not “dairy
in the dell” but “farmer in the dell”, in which case the skirt should
be called not dirndl but firndl.

(There are some who contend we will never know the true origins
of dirndl. To those faint hearted Cassandras I say, remember how
everyone laughed at Edison and Franklin and Fulton and Marconi
and Sigafoos. ISigafoos, in case you have forgotten, invented the
nostril, without which breathing, as we know it today, would not be
possible.] The origins of dirndl will be found, say I, and anyone
who believes the contrary is a lily-livered churl and if he’ll step
outside for a minute, I’ll give him a thrashing he won’t soon forget.)

But I digress. We were smoking a Philip Morris and talking about
the latest campus styles. Casual, we agree, is the key word. But
casual need not mean drab. Liven up your outfits with a touch of
glamor. Even the lowly dungaree and man-shirt combination can
be made exciting if you’ll adorn it with a simple necklace of 120
matched diamonds. With Bermuda shorts, wear gold knee-cymbals.
Be guided by the famous poet Cosmo Sigafoos (whose brother Sam
it was who invented the nostril) who wrote:

Sparkle, my beauty,

Shimmer and shine,

The night is young,
The air98 like wine,
Cling to a leaf,
Hang on a vine,
Crawl on your belly.
It's time to dine.

(Mr. Sigafoos, it should be explained, was writing about a glow-
worm. Insects, as everyone knows, are among Mr. Sigafoos’ favorite
subjects for poems. Who can ever forget his immortal Ode to a Boll
Weevil? Or his Tumbling Along With the Tumbling Tumblebug?
Or his Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid? Mr. Sigafoos has been inactive
since the invention of DDT.)	%

But i digress. We were smoking a Philip Morris and discussing
fashions. Let us turn now to headwear. The motif in hats this year
will be familiar American scenes. There will be models to fit every
head—for example, the ‘.‘Empire State Building” for tall thin heads;
the “Jefferson Memorial” for squatty ones; “Niagara Falls” for dry
scalps. Feature of the collection is the “Statue of Liberty,” complete
with a torch that actually burns. This is very handy for lighting
your Philip Morrises, which is very important because no matter
how good Philip Morrises are, they’re nowhere unless you light them.

We come now to the highlight of this year’s fashion parade—a mad
fad that’s sweeping the chic set at high tone campuses all over the
country. All the gals who are in the van, in the swim, and in the
know are doing it. Doing what, you ask? Getting tattooed, of course!
You just don’t rate these days unless you’ve got at least an anchor
on your biceps. If you really want to be the envy of the campus, get
yourself a four masted schooner, or a heart with FATHER printed
inside of it, or a—

I interrupt this column to bring you a special announcement. A
runner has just handed me the following bulletin:	t

“The origin of the word dirndl has at long last been discovered.
On June 27, 1846, Dusty Schwartz, the famous scout and Indian
fighter, went into the Golden Nugget Saloon in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
The Golden Nugget had just imported a new entertainer from the
East. She came out and did her dance in pink tights. Dusty Schwartz
had never seen anything I ke that in his life, and he was much
impressed. He watched with keen interest as she did her numbers,
and he thought about her all the way home. When he got home, his
wife Feldspar was waiting to show him a new skirt she had made
for herself. ‘How do you like my new skirt, Dusty?’ said Feldspar.

looked at the large voluminous garment, then thought of the
pink tights on the dancing girl. ‘Your skirt is darn dull,’ said Dusty.
Darn dull’ was later shortened to ‘dirndl which is how dirndls
got their name.”	©Mo 8huImini MM

First Loss in Eleven Starts

by Paul Baptist

The UC cross country team lost
23-32 to Wheaton Saturday after-
noon in a hard-run contest over
the rolling hills of an exclusive
Wheaton golf course, complete
with trained crocodile and late
season golfers.

Fleet Kikuo “Cookie” Moriya
won the race in the sparkling time
of 19 minutes flat for the 3 5/8
mile course, followed by Chicago’s
first man, Walt Deike. After Al
Pace of Wheaton and Paul Bap-
tist of Chicago crossed the finish
line the outcome was decided by
two Wheaton runners who slipped
in ahead of Chicago’s Toulouse
Otromundo, Lowell Hawkinson
and Jim Flynn, who finished 7th,
9th, and 10th consecutively.

Qreenlee’s Views

A Column of Comment

by Sam Greenlee

Winning strings seem to be frightening things around here, for
one reason or another. The Maroon cross-country team seemed well
aware of it and perhaps to keep the alumni hopes from soaring to
Rose-Bowl-type proportions had a streak of ten consecutive victories
strapped by the Wheaton squad this past week end.

The Wheaton race was a good one, and the combination of a tricky,
wind-swept course, poorly marked and not at all well-explained to
the visitors before the race, and-—more important than anything else
—a scrappy Wheaton team who would not quit, proved the answer
to the outcome. No alibis are needed; the Maroons were simply out-
run by a good Wheaton team; but the final outcome might well be
reversed on the home course.

Deike kingpin

Walt Deike is the kingpin, no new position to him sin\e he was
out in front of a few of Wisconsin’s best squads and the Badgers
are consistently the team to beat in Big 10 cross-country. Walt’s a
med student and a few decades older than most of the squad, so it’s
not surprising to know that if you can ever get close enough to him
during a race that creaking noise is just his ancient joints protesting.

Paul Baptist decided that running might be fun, and after shop-
ping around during the track season he left with delusions about
becoming a pole vaulter. But he’s found a home in the distances.

Tinkie Haines is a native of South Africa, and his Boer accent adds
an international flavor to the proceedings.

Art Omohundro, or Toulouse Otromundo as he’ll be known for
many moons by the other members of the squad, looks as if a stiff
wind would blow him away—which sometimes happens.

•	Party, party

Sugar Jim Flynn is the politician of the squad, and if the other
party gets mad because I advise here that he’s a' good bet to vote for
in the elections, all they have to do is send the squad a candidate
who can cover four miles as fast as he and I'll give said guy a plug,
too. Jim is the other half of the thin man duo.

Lowell Hawkinson is a misplaced middle distance runner who
feels much more at home in a quarter- or half mile race than in this
sustained agony, but you’d never know it from the way he moves
out there.

Since a cross-country team numbers seven there’s room for one
more, namely this guy who’s qualified to write about the above be-
cause he gazes at the backs of their necks at varying distances—
every time the team goes through its paces. Suffice is to say that I
don’t think cross country is the greatest thing since bubble gum.

thou......?

THE CHICAGO MAROON

October 22, 1954

Douglas cancels rally date; Unidentified student robbed

campaigning at UC unwise by gunmen Sat, morning

“Campaigning on the Uni-
versity of Chicago is the kiss
of death.” With this statement
representatives of Paul Doug-
las, candidate for re-election
to the Senate from Illinois,
cancelled his scheduled appear-
ance at a UC rally.

The mass meeting, originally
scheduled for last Monday eve-
ning in the fieldhouse, was to
feature Douglas, Barratt O’Hara.
Representative from the Second
congresisonal district; Walter
Johnson, chairman of the history
department at the University of
Chicago, and Emil Mazey, polit-
ical action chairman and secre-
tary! xeasurex’ of the UAW-C1O.
Johnson, who accompanied Adlai
Stevenson as an advisor on Steven-
son’s recent world tour, was to be
chairman of the affair. The Demo-
crtic party of Cook County had
scheduled Douglas fox' the event.

All of the personalities except
Douglas had accepted the invita-
tion to attend the rally, and the
director of the speakers' bureau
of the Democratic party in Cook
county had told members of the
Students for Douglas organiza-
tion on campus to go ahead with
publicity on Douglas’ appearance.

Wednesday evening. Ralph Fer-
tig. a member of the non-partisan
citizens committee for Barratt O’-

Hara, received a call from Doug-
las Anderson, administrative as-
sistant to Douglas, cancelling the
engagement.

AH must not agree

Anderson said that the Demo-
cratic organization had no juris-
diction to schedule Douglas for
anything other than meetings of
ward organizations.

He furthei' stated that it would
not benefit Mr. Douglas political-
ly to speak on the UC campus.
Anderson also expressed the wish
that people at the University, and
the Independent Voters of Illinois,
would not endorse Douglas and,
in fact, if these people would op-
pose Douglas he would be “bet-
ter off’ and would “get more
votes.”

Anderson explained that the or-
ganization had already had
enough trouble disassociating
Douglas’ name from the radical
political elements in Illinois and
that “certain newspapers and or-
ganizations” would play up Doug-
las’ appearance on the campus
with the effect of “red-baiting.”

In spite of these disappoint-
ments, the Students for Douglas
organization on campus is con-
tinuing its work on behalf of
Douglas, with meetings scheduled
for this week.

A UC student who was unwilling to identify himself was
robbed at gunpoint at 1:45 a.m. Saturday morning in front
of 5720 Kimbark. The student was walking home from a movie
when two unknown men accosted and robbed him of $12 and

his change?

“They knew what they were
of them held the gun on me as
he rifled my pockets, while the
other stood behind me. They

didn’t even leave me a dime to
call the police with, but they re-
turned my wallet and walked non-
chalantly away.”

The student walked to the po-
lice station at 53rd and Lake Park
and gave the police a description
of* the two men. He described one
as being about 35, of medium
height and build. The other was
younger and taller. Neither one
had any unusual characteristics.

Vogt to lecture

“Religion and art” will be the
theme of a series of four lectures
to be delivered during the next
two weeks by Dr. Van Ogden
Vogt, minister emeritus of the
First Unitarian church.

The lectures to be held at 8 p.m.
at Hull Chapel are: “Architecture
and the free spirit,” Oct. 25; “Re-
ligious art of the First Unitarian
church,” Oct. 27; “The three-fold
imperative,” Nov. 1; and “The cer-
tainty of worship,” Nov. 3. .

doing,” the student said. “One

A detective there, after telling
him the police would investigate
the matter, said that there would
be more robberies “as the weather
got colder.” He also said that
there are “a lot of people out of
jobs in the area and they will
spend their last $10 on a revol-
ver.”

Kitt reduced,
Sillman says

UC students may now see
Eartha Kitt in Mrs. Patterson at
reducer prices; Mrs. Patterson, a
play with music, is currently play-
ing at the Harris Theatre.

Following his policy of extend-
ing a special rate to college stu-
dents in every city to see his pro-
dx:ctions, Leonard Sillman, the
play’s producer, is offering $4 and
$4.50 scats fpr $2.30 on Nov. 1, 2,
8, and 9. Tickets may be pur-
chased through the Reynolds
Club SG service center.

ISL protests
SRP literature

An ISL charge that SRP
distributed unfair campaign
literature wag discussed by
representatives of both parties
with William Birenbaum, director
of student activities, Wednesday
afternoon. No decisions were
reached by the group.

The controversy centered about
an SRP poster entitled “It*s not
liberal. Is it responsible?” The
poster quoted from the ISL plat-
form in the NSA election, 1954:
“ISL delegates will support the
principle of exchange with all
countries in the world, including
those behind the Iron Curtain.”
In the second box it stated that
“All ISL delegates voted against
their own platform’s stand. . . .”

ISL charged that using these
statements constituted unfair
campaign techniques, because the
qualifying sentence from the plat-
form was deleted.

ISL demanded a retraction or
an amendment to both controver-
sial parts of the literature. Biren-
baum asked SRP representatives.
Paul Breslow and Larry Lichten-
stein, “what SRP intended to do.”
Breslow suggested that SRP
might be willing to publish the
qualifying statement, but would
not consider a complete retrac-
tion.

Morganthau...............

(from page 5)

Through the McCarran Act, “we
are driving the uncommitted in-
tellectuals of Europe into the
arms of Russia,” he stated.

“The European thinks that no
reliance can be placed in such a
country and such a government.
They consider us a bunch of rich
and powerful clowns.”

The general substance of our
foreign policy in recent years is
another cause of our loss of pres-
tige in Europe, Morgenthau
claimed. “It is a fact that we
are xegarded—if not as the main
obstacle—as one of the two main
obstacles to peace in the world
tod^y. Lack of leadership within
the American government gives
credence to this opinion.”

“We can gain back the support
of Europeans as quickly as we
lost it if we pursue the right poli-
cies,” he concluded.”
