Schein Discovers Particle
Beleived An Antiproton

Dr. Marcel Schein reported last Friday at the
Seattle meeting of the American Physical Society
that he has uncovered evidence that may prove the
existence of the antiproton.

The UC professor of physics and affiliated with
the Institute for Nuclear Studies captured the par-
ticle in a packet of nuclear emulsions, which are
similar to photographic film, only thicker. The
emulsions were carried by a high-altitude “sky-
hook” balloon 100,000 feet over Texas last winter
and the discovery of the partible was made on
April 30 by Mrs. Elizabeth Goodman, a scanner
employed by the physics department.

Sees Rows of Electrons

What she saw was a narrow bundle of 21 “photo
produced electron pairs.” Under the microscope

these electrons make a diagonal track of parallel
rows of tiny dots across a series of ten photo-
graphic plates. This cascade is familiar to cosmic
ray scientists as the paired electrons, positive and
negative, traveling away from the “scene of anni-
hilation.”

The annihilation reportedly occurred when the
particle—the antiproton—tore through the films
at an incredible speed and energy of ten billion
volts before it struck a proton in the aluminum
covering the film pack. The suspected antiproton
and the proton were annihilated. Presumably both
were converted into energy—as units of light,
called photons. These were then reconverted into
matter as the pairs of electrons.

Dr. Marcel Schein . . .

. . . the Czechoslovak-born scientist who came
to the US in 1938, reported last week the discov-
ery of what he believed to be an anti-proton.

has observed a somewhat similar event in high-
altitdue cloud chamber observations.

1,000 Teachers Attend

Reading Conferance Here

by Robert Quinn

Newly devised “situational” tests, statistical correlations between reading ability and num-
ber of years spent in school, and reading handicaps peculiar to bright and skilled children
were discussed before a group of 1,000 national educators attending the University of
Chicago’s seventeenth annual reading conference, June 29 through July 2.

The promotion of maximal reading growth among able learners was the theme of this
year’s conference, which opened with an address by Newton Edwards, professor of educa-

College-like Courses

A series of College-like courses in which both pupils and
teachers receive credit are presently being sponsored by the
University and the Chicago Public School System.

The school and college program for teachers which began
June. 28 and will extend through July 30 is designed-to help

educators solve the problems
ondary schools and colleges.

Each morning the teachers
witness demonstration classes
in which the participants are re-
cruited from Chicago high
schools. Discussions, laboratories
and occasional lectures are sched-
uled for the afternoons.

The demonstration classes are
designed to show educators the
ability of average high school stu-
dents to learn by the discussion
method to master subpects once
believed to be too advanced for
them.

By the institution of college-like
methods of instruction and by
the elimination of duplication of
subject matter in high schools
and colleges it is hoped that the
transition from high school to
college may be made easier for the
student.

Students in the demonstration
classes receive a full major high
- school credit for taking two
courses. Under a Ford Foundation
grant the program had planned
to handle 97 students in seven

Hutchins Declines
To Visit Dorms

Former Chancellor Robert
M. Hutchins yesterday declined
an invitation to visit Burton-
Judson dormitories for dinner
and discussion. The invitation
was made by Kenneth Lewal-
sky, resident head of Coulter
house.

Hutchins, who had been in
Chicago this week working
with Encyclopedia Britannica,
left yesterday for South Bend,
Indiana, and will travel to New
York today. He said he would
see if he could accept the in-
vitation when he returns to the
city in August.

tion at UC and the University
of South Carolina. He spoke
on “Education of the Able
Student — Social Significance and
Goals.”

The use of “situational” tests to
select the brighter children in
middle-grade school classes was
suggested to the Tuesday general
sessions by Newton R. Calhoun,
psychologist in the Winnetka
schools. These tests are designed
to compensate for the failure of
IQ and similar intelligence tests
to relate directly to the child’s ac-
tivities in and out of school.

Children Make Scrapbooks

To provide additional informa-
tion Calhoun suggested some 13
“situational” tests which confront
the child with a task in which he
his creativity. They range from
is creativity. They range from
making scrapbooks and poster
displays to creative writing and
dramatics. Independent research
on a topic that interests the child,
and map making, even of imagi-
nary countries, is also useful.

One revealing test is the way
the child reacts to humor. Making
jokes and parodies indicates a re-
sponsiveness that bespeaks su-
periority. By using these situa-
tional tests, in addition to others,

the teacher can make it less likely
that the able child will miss the
opportunities to bring out his po-
tential gifts, he concluded.

Bright Children Skim

Reading problems peculiar to
such gifted children were enumer-
ated for the Friday conference
session by Alice Brooks McGuire,
librarian at the University of
Texas laboratory school. Mrs. Mc-
Guire felt that children who are
too bright and skilled in reading
often skim rapidly over too many
books, instead of absorbing what
the books can teach.

As a remedy for this reading
fault she suggested group discus-
sion and conversations as a means
to helping brighter students sift
productive ideas out of the vast
quantity of material they read.

Mrs. McGuire reported that
adolescents classify their associ-
ates as “wheels, brains, outsiders,
mice, and outcasts.” Both
“wheels” and “brains” may be
able learners, but it is the
“wheels” who are the leaders of
their classmates, the “brains” be-
ing unable to achieve the proper
blending of books and life itself.

Mrs. McGuire cited as particu-
larly valuable in the social orien-
tation of children those books
which stress understanding of so-
ciety, overcoming shyness, and
emotional independence. Others
lead their readers to an under-
standing of other social groups
and teach them to appreciate
beauty.

Gray Discusses Survey

The lack of connection between
the number of years a person
spends in school and his reading
ability was stressed by William
S. Gray, professor emeritus of
education at UC. Gray spoke in
reference to an intensive study of
a group of successful people
known to be widely read, whose
education varies from less than
high school graduation to posses-
sion of a Ph.D.

Good readers, the survey found,
are distinguished not by the

amount of education they have re-
ceived but by their curiosity and
by their consciousness of a cen-
tral philosophy which directs
their thinking. The good reader
witout exception, Gray discovered,
is acutely aware of his own inter-
ests, reading cautiously and sus-
pending judgments until he reach-
es a valid conclusion which he
can express in terms of his own
philosophy.

Discusses Education’s Scope

Gray also stated that the value
in a modern educational system
lies not alone in its ability to make
the student occupationally and
professional proficient. “The con-
ditions of our world,” he said,
“now require that education be
made a positive instrument of
social policy. It must be a means '
of equipping the individual with
the motivations, the knowledge,
the understandings, and the social
skills extending all the way from
the narrow confines of home and
community to the broad expanse
of national and international af-
fairs”

Thrifty Buy
Turns Costly

About $3,000 to $3,500 damage
was done Sunday night by a fire
in the psychology building, accord-
ing to the estimate of W. R. Zell-
ner of Building and Grounds. A
used refrigerator purchased by
the University about a month age
started the blaze, which was dis-
covered by a faculty member at
about 10:15 p.m. Sunday.

Most of the damage was to the
baseemnt shop in which the fire
began, but firemen had to break
windows and doors all the way
to the tird floor because of the
fumes. Nine pieces of equipment
had the fire under control in one-
half hour.

Playwrights' 'Henry'

Notable Success

Yearbook Traditionally,
Professionally Planned

In “Henry IV,” part I, the Playwrights Theater Club has
achieved another notable success. Those who believe that
Shakespeare’s historical dramas are not eminently playable
would be astonished by the gusto and enthusiasm with which
the actors attack their roles.

More than once during the performance the liberal sword-

play and carefree splashing of
sack had the people in the
front rows hunched low in
their seats. This vigorous conduct
somewhat jeopardized the dignity
of the play, but any loss was more
♦han redeemed by its dynamic im-
pact on the audience.

The play got off on an excep-
tionally bad foot. During the first
scene Edward Asner as the King
was apparently mastered by a
long dull speech, the import of
which was never clear. He was
scarcely aided by the ominous
cloud of conspiracy created by the
excited whispers, malignant
glances, and menacing attitudes
of the assembled lords and bish-
ops. Asner’s own exquisite ges-
tures were smothered by this
overindulgence of his fellow play-
ers.

Play Conies to Life

In the second scene, with the
appearance of Robert Kidd as
Prince Hal and Lee Henry as Fal-
staff, the play came to life.' This
did not happen immediately, how-
ever, since it was first necessary
for the audience to adjust to
Henry’s loud and aggressive act-
ing. The chief fault of the play lay
in this offense by almost every
actor save Kidd.

With the possible exception of
♦he bumptious messengers, these
performances would be quite ac-
ceptable on a large stage, but in
an intimate theater they impose
an unnecessary burden on the
audience. Once this adjustment
had been made Henry’s Falstaff
was as enjoyable as one could
wish.

Delivery Natural

By contrast Kidd’s performance
was wholly free of bombast, and
his delivery most natural and un-
affected. When he spoke one for-
got the lines were Shakespeare’s,
yet there was no lack of sensitiv-
ity in his handling of the poetical

passages.

His role was especially difficult
since he had the task of turning a
convincing rogue into a convinc-
ing hero solely by means of two
or three short speeches which on
paper sound extremely dubious.
In this he was most successful,
although in the brilliant scene
where he is forgiven by the King,
the bulk of the credit must go
to Asner.

Piven ‘Magnetic Character’

Another outstanding contribu-
tion to the play was the perform-
ance of Byrne Piven as Harry
Hotspur. A purist might have
found him too athletic, particular-
ly for the small stage, and it is
to be wondered if Shakespeare
contemplated the protracted bill-
ing and cooing between him and
Lady Percy. On the other hand
the former established a magnetic
character which greatly pleased
the audience, and the second add-
ed immeasurably to the play’s
charm.

In the facial expression depart-
ment Piven exhibited the greatest
variety and control of anyone in
the play. This, by the way, was
one of the play’s strongest fea-
tures, and none of the speeches
were received by blank looks cul-
minating in forced laughter or
astonishment which is such a
great hazard in a Shakespearean
production.

No praise is too high for the
production itself. The stage was
tastefully spare, the costumes
rich looking, even from close
quarters, and the original music

of Tom O’Horgan was excellent, the College graduates and those

The “baffling” mystery of campus was finally solved last week when, astonishing almost
everybody, including the Cap and Gown staff, the UC yearbook made its long awaited
appearance. The forty-seventh annual edition was planned in a traditional manner and
administered with a professional touch.	.	.

Quite a few strides have been taken since the amateur efforts or Echo: Midway and the
grand conceptions of last year’s book which were never quite attained.

These advances were most :--------------------------------------------------------------—

in evidence in the higher qual-
ity of the photography, print-
ing and general technical layout.
It is apparent that ihe yearbook
staff took a great amount of care
in its construction.

Organizations Coverage Lacking

Unfortunately, many student
organizations were not given their
due coverage. Organizations such
as the Documentary Film Group,
World University Service and the
raft of political organizations
which infest this campus were
left out entirely. It is difficult to
understand why a page should be
devoted to the Pre - Med Club
while the College Law Society
was excluded.

It was quite frustrating to turn
to the section on activities and,
find it end only a few pages later.
We have always been under the
impression that there are about
two million clubs on campus.

Students, Scientists Stare
At Sun's Strange Show

“Birds began to fly back and forth, twittering and chirping as the sun went under. It
didn’t get rornpletely dark, but one or two stars could be seen. Everything was grey.” _
T hus one ora group of about 16 University of Chicago students who went as amateurs to
Minnesota to see the total eclipse of the sun described the climax of what he called “some-
thing majestic and powerful.”

Traveling to see something
of UC students drove to Min-
nesota for the spectacle. One
car arrived on the west shore
of White Bear lake, about 10 miles
northeast of St. Paul and about
five miles from the center of to-
tality, and were surprised when a
car of UC students from Argonne
arrived at the same spot just a
few hours later. Neither group
know of the other’s plans.

“We picked the spot because it
was for enough from the lights of
the city, close to the center of to-
tality, and on the west shore of a
Jake, besides being near the main
arteries. Maybe they used the
same road map, or maybe UC
students are all alike,” a student
in the first group observed.

Corona Easily Visible

Especially interesting to the
group were the effects of the

Schein...

(from Page 1)

Schein, his technician David
Haskin, and a research associate,
Robert Glasser, report: “An ex-
planation of this event by conven-
tional mechanisms has proven im-
possible. In view of this the ten-
tative suggestion is offered that
the event may be due to annihila-
tion of an antiparticle.”

Theory Formed in 1929

The theory of antiparticle, or
antiproton, in various forms, has
been considered plausible since
1929, but this is the first time that
there has been a possibility of its
proof. An antiproton is the coun-
terpart, the opposite of a proton
- in other words, negative matter.

It is considered doubtful if
many of these particles will ever
reach the earth. In the dense at-
mosphere below one hundred
thousand feet it could easily strike
a particle in an oxygen or hydro-

gen atom and disappear long be-
fore reaching the surface,

Particle Used in Equations

Schein believes that the largest
atom accellerators will not pro-
duce them. At present the largest
. atom-smashing machines produce
particles with energies not much
above six billion volts.

The uranium atom in fission
exerts energy of two million volts.

that none of them had ever

eclipse on shadows. Two shadows
were visible during the partial
eclipse, and light coming through
a small hole in a piece of paper
formed a crescent. They noticed
a rippling effect in the surround-
ings as the eclipse ended. These
strange lighting ripples seemed
to decrease in frequency until the
sun was out again.

The students reported that the
corona was easily visible. “It was
very, very interesting. It was cer-
tainly worth the trip,” one student
remarked.

Use Scanner at Yerkes

Meanwhile, UC astronomers
were busy the morning of June 30
studying the eclipse with a new
electronic scanner designed at
Yerkes, the UC observatory. The
device was constructed to cut

through the veil of scattered light
in the earth’s atmosphere making

ever, as before, in the theoretical
completing of atom equations.

One Report Written

Schein, Haskin and Glasser have
prepared one report al retidy on
the “Narrow shower of pure pro-
tons at one hundred thousand
feet.” In this report they state, “A
more detailed account of this
event will be published later when
a more careful discussion of pos-
sible causes can be undertaken.”

Mrs. Goodman had examined
several of the photographic plates
before she discovered something
“obviously unusual.” At the time
she was “curious and excited.”
The scientists had suspicions of
the phenomena they found, but
not until they spent several more
days of patient labor tracing the
path of the electrons could they
reach any conclusions.

Schein Returning Monday

At present Haskin, Glasser and

Mrs. Goodman are tabulating
more data from the photographic
plates in the cosmic ray labora.-
tories in Ryerson hall. Schein re-

Anthenelli

Tells Tasks
Of Magazine

“We try to interpret the Univer-
sity to the alumni,” said Felicia
Anthenelli, describing her new job
as editor of the University of Chi-
cago Magazine.

In most cases, she explained,
this means keeping alumni
abreast of all the things that hap-
pen in the curriculum, in the hos-
pitals, in the classrooms, in the
laboratories, in the extra-curricu-
lum, and, not least of all, in the
minds of UC’s faculty and student
body.

When issues arise, the magazine
tries to explain why groups at
the University have assumed a ’
certain position or taken a certain
action. “The Magazine itself,” she
emphasized, “has no editorial posi-
tion."

Job Not Easy

Her job, Miss Anthenelli ex-
plained, was not an easy one. “We
must compete with the best of the
professional magazines and news-
papers for the attention of one of
the most literate audiences in the
world.”

Miss Anthenelli describes her-
self as a journalist with a small
“j.” She got her only formal jour-
nalism training in high school in
New York. When her family
moved to New Jersey she decided
she wanted to do some newspaper
work. She went to work for a
weekly and later moved on to a
daily in Brunswick, New Jei'sey.

Covered Suburbs

Journalism is not an easy field
for a woman to enter and then the
successful aspirant usually finds
herself restricted to only a few
beats.

But it was wartime when Miss
Anthenelli went to work in Bruns-
wick and male reporters were in
short supply. She soon found her-
self in charge of the suburban
beat, complete with police courts,
hospitals and high society.

She said referring to World
War II, “here was something big
happening and I had to get into
it. To the great disgust of every-
body at Brunswick I joined the
Women’s Army Corps.” She does
not pretend she spent a tough
war, but did public relations while
stationed in Miami and Daytona
Beach.

Came to UC

When the war ended Miss An-
thenelli decided to go to college.
New Jersey College for Women
was her first choice, but girl’s col-
lege rules did not sit well with
her. “After all I had just gotten
out of the army.”

She then chose UC and Gates
hall. She found herself “wild
about the college” and as for
Gates hall, “they left you alone."

Miss Anthenelli receiver her
A.B. in 1949 and went to work for
the now defunct Journal of Com-
merce. When it was bought out
by the Wall Street Journal she be-
came a reporter for one of the
most respected economic journals
in the country. “And I can’t even
add,” Miss Anthenelli chuckles.

What does she intend to do with
the UC Magazine? “I’m still learn-
ing about being an editor,” she
says, but added that She would
like to see more articles from the
humanities division. She said. “Re-
cent issues have been pretty heav-
ily weighted on the part of the
sciences.”

Education Buzzes with Activity

Teachers Turn Students

During Summer Quarter

by Larry Littlejohn

Unlike the College and most of the other departments of
the University, the department of education buzzes with activ-
ity during the summer. In addition to the special workshops
and conferences, many teachers turn student and take sum-

mer courses in the regular degree program. The present en-
rollment is approximately 260 — slightly larger than normal

— and represents students
from all over the world.

The department is offering
•everal workshops for teachers
and school administrators this
summer. A workshop in eco-
nomics, which began June 21,
will end July 30. This workshop is
designed to give elementary
school teachers a basic under-
standing of the nation’s economic
institutions.

In conjunction with the seven-
teenth annual conference on read-
ing (see story on page 1) the de-
partment is offering a workshop
in reading from June 28 through
July 23. The purpose of this work-
shop is to help teachers with the
reading problems of their stu-
dents.

The workshop staff includes
personnel from Wayne and Cor-
nell universities as well as UC.
For students who have reading
problems or wish to improve their
reading habits the education de-
partment also sponsors a reading
clinic on campus.

From July 19 to 23 a conference

on research in educational admin-
istration will be an activity of the
department under the sponsor-
ship of the Midwest Administra-
tion Center. The conference will
place its emphasis on the implica-
tion of research for personnel ad-
ministration, public relations in
education and the use of outside
resources by pupils.

The department of religion and
public education of the National
Council of the Churches of Christ
is joining with the department in
sponsoring a workshop of home,
church and school relations in the
religious education of youth. The
conference, which will be held
from July 26 to August 13, is for
teachers, school administrators,
clergymen, religious educational
leaders and leaders of parent
groups.

100 Attend Workshops

Approximately 100 teachers are
attending present workshops, and
even more are expected to attend
those scheduled later in the sum-
mer, swelling the department of
education’s enrollment even more.

At Workshop

Many school teachers are at-
tracted to the University of Chi-
cago for advanced study during
the summer quarter by the myri-
ad of workshops, conferences and
courses. Two of these are Mrs.
Velma Wigans and Mrs. Nina
Cran who are taking part in the
economics workshop offered by
the department of education.

During nine months of the
year they teach the intermediate
grades in the Webster County ele-
mentary schools in Fort Dodge,
Iowa, but this summer they were
sent by the school system there
to spend July at the workshop so
that they could “take back eco-
nomic techniques to Iowa,” as
Mrs. Cran described their venture.

Enjoys Workshop Courses

When they return to Fort
Dodge they will join a school com-
mittee there “to work out a
course of study” in economics.
Mrs. Wigans enjoys her courses
in the workshop. When asked if
she learned anything new there,
she replied, “Yes, it’s given me
some very good economic atti-
tudes and concepts.”

When the class work is ended,
the two women take time out to
tour the city. This is their first
visit to Chicago and like most
tourists they have wasted no time
in visiting some of the famous
sights in the city. They have jour-
neyed to Brookfield zoo and found
themselves caught in the hectic
activity of “Loop” pedestrians
when they visited the downtown
stores.

They Like B-J Food

When they first arrived at the
University .they overheard . two
students discussing politics and
were dismayed to find “such Com-
munistic attitudes” among the
students, but their stay at Burton-
Judson has convinced them that
most UC students are normal
politically and they have attended
the picnics and open houses with
the rest of the summer residents.

Contrary to the attitude of most
dormitory residents, however,
they think that B-J food is won-
derful.” “I never ate so much
back home,” Mfs, Wigans said.

In the evenihgs the women can
be seen sitting in the courts wait-
ing for an evening breeze before
they retire for the night. They
explained that the climate Is not
so humid back in Iowa. And Mrs.
Wigans qdded, “My only com-
plaint is the weather.”
