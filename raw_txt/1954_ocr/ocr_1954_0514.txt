SQ studies academic freedom;
session forms interim group

Student Government devoted most of its Tuesday night
meeting, its last session until the autumn quarter, to ques-
tions involving civil liberties and academic freedom.

The assembly authorized a letter to the House un-American
activities committee protesting recent trends in the commit-
tee’s investigation of possible Communist infiltration in the

University of Chicago, May 14, 1954

31

nation’s schools.

Written by Martin Gouter-
man (ISL-bi sci), chairman of
the SG civil liberties committee,
the letter says that “the investiga-
. tions of higher education have be-
come completely jemoved from
subversion and are wholly con-
cerned with ideas.”

Instructors liberties to be investigated

SG instructed the civil liberties
committee to find out all it can
about the suspension this week of
three instructors by the Univer-
sity of Michigan.

Dr. Mark Nickerson, assistant
professor of pharmacology; Dr.
Clement L. Markert, assistant pro-
fessor of zoology; and Dr. H.

— Chandler Davis, math instructor,

were suspended after they refused
to tell the House committee
whether they have ever been Con>
munists.

Contempt citations recommended

Contempt citations had been
recommended against Davis and
against U of M students Edward
Shaffer and Byron E. Sharp after
they appeared before the commit-
tee.

Gouterman, in another report,
announced that an investigation
has cleared Billings and Lying-In
Hospitals of charges of discrim-
ination. He said the medical school
is still being investigated on its
admissions policy.

SECC views problems of slums
reports on past, explores its future

by Warren Roy Spachner

"The Process of Renewal —What's Been Done and What's Ahead," was the subject of a panel discus-
sion which followed the second annual meeting of the South East Chicago Commission (SECC). The meet-
ing was held at 8 p.m. Tuesday night in the Hyde Park Baptist Church before a packed house.

This discussion dealt with three major problems; the causes of slums, a proposed plan of the SECC to

rid the Hyde Park area of
slums, and the effects on
the landlords and tenants
caught in the middle, if such a
plan is put into operation. The dis-
cussion consisted of a series of
questions answered by members
of the panel.

According to the panel, slums
are the result of four factors
which may or may not act inde-
pendently of each other: •

1.

2.

3.

4.

overcrowding of the residences
in the neighborhood

illegal conversions of the flats
or houses, etc., to accommodate
this overcrowded condition

lack of proper upkeep and main-
tenance of residents by the land-
lords

the overcharging of rents by

ants.

This overcrowding occurs since
people in areas adjoining the Hyde
Park District, are forced into our
neighborhood by the pressure of
an extremely dense population
there.

As to what SECC intends to do
to prevent the complete ruination
of this area, Julian Levi, executive
director of the SECC, came forth
with the following plan. Details
are still being worked, but the
plan should be completed Within
60 days. This plan consists of five
points:

5.

development of new and ade-
quate housing which will rid
the area of the “cancerous
blight” which is among us.

1.

2.

development" of an adequate
school system with adequate
playgrounds for the young peo-
ple of this area

development of adequate park-
ing facilities

Levi, "wo mutt not delay"

Levi concluded his remarks by
saying, “These projects must meet
the needs and desires of the com-
munity. The redevelopment of this
area should serve as a model to
other communities to show them
what may be done along the same
lines. Finances will be available
to cushion the shock of those who
find they must relocate because
their homes or residences are in a
blighted area. This is the time to

the landlords	3.

Landlord's desires

These four factors result solely 4.
from a desire on the part of cer-
tain landlords for profit, without
regard for the needs of the ten-

revision of the traffic rules for
safety and other reasons
development of commercial en-
terprises to serve the ever-in-
creasing demands of the neigh-
borhood.

UC employees bargaining
for wage hike, recognition

University employees are currently bargaining with the
administration for union recognition and pay benefits. The
University of Chicago Employees Union affiliated with the
CIO government and civic employees organizing committee
last summer after an unsuccessful attempt at recognition.

Among the union’s grievances at that time were wage in-
equities in job classifications,  -:— ---------

,	* ,	- Yancey, vice-chairman of the na-

low wages, lack of an ade- tional CIO union. Yancey recently
quate grievance procedure, led successful bargaining sessions
lack of holiday pay in some de- for employes of the University’s
partments, and Saturday work, medical center.

John McCollum, acting chairman The employes union, Local 1223,
of the union, said.	will hold officer meeting Wednes-

Bargaining is being led by John day, May 19 at 8 p.m. in Ida Noyes.

mittee, plus two minority mem-
bers, to act on the assembly’s be-
half until October. The interim
group was prohibited from mak-
ing changes in the constitution or
the SG by-laws.

Clive Gray, president of SG,
told the assembly that a smaller
place is being sought for the pro-
posed student housing coopera-
tive following “unsa' isfactory” re-
sponse to the suggested location
at the Mayflower hotel.

The civil liberties committee’s
report praised the UC-affiliated
hospitals as “much better than

seize the initiative; we must not-other Chicago hospitals" on the

delay!”

People who were worried about
the “plan” and how it would af-
fect them asked a number of ques-
tions of the panel. The following
is a summary of the answers giv-
en to these people:

"Pocket of blight" defined

At present there exist a number
of blighted areas in our commu-
nity. By law “a pocket of blight”
is defined as an area with a mini-
mum size of two acres or about
half the size of the average city
block. The buildings in this area
are considered to be substandard
as living quarters, so substandard

question of discrimination.

Announce next issue

This will be the lost issue of
the MAROON until Friday, June
4, 1954.

in fact, that it is often recommend-
ed that they be torn down and re-
placed with adequate housing.

18 months to get the necessary ap-

state, and national authorities, but

Mandel concert shows Robeson

still excellent as singer, actor

Despite the objections of the American Legion Paul Robe-
son sang in Mandel Hall last Saturday night, and included in
the bargain pianist Alan Booth. The audience was indeed for-
tunate that this boisterous crowd of patriots has not yet be-
come the sole judge of musical talent in America, for Robeson
is a musician of the very highest caliber.

His program consisted of
Schubert, Dvorak, and Mus-
sorgsky songs, various folk
and popular songs, and the death
scene from Boris Godunov. The
last mentioned was undoubtedly
the outstanding feature of the
evening, and the magnitude of the
accomplishment becomes even
more imposing when one notes
that the barest skeleton of the
massive array of orchestral and
choral mass present in this scene
was represented by a piano.

Mussorgsky’s masterpiece is
one of the half dozen really
great operas. It incorporates the
literary talent of Pushkin with the

composer’s genius, and the music
is perhaps more the mirror of the
text than in any other opera,
which accounts for its failure to
stand up in translation, be it
English or Italian.

It would follow, and in fact does,
that a singer with the musical
and dramatic resources of Robe-
son should be ideally suited for
the performance of the role. His
interpretation was both faithful
and beautiful, and one got the
rare feeling of complete identifica-
tion with the part, the only jarring
element being a pronounced Eng-
lish accent in Robeson’s Russian.

Katz proposes 'analyst-lawyer contract Outing Club to hike out west
to determine responsibility of criminals in case of H'bomb raid

The UC Outing Club has scheduled a hike from the Univer-

"Just what people are responsible for crimes they committ” was a question discussed by	_	___

Wilbur Katz, James Parker Hall Professor of Law, in the fifth lecture of the William Ellery sity to Palos Park a week from Sunday. The main purpose of

to reach safety in the event of an H-bomb attack on Chicago.

Channing series, "Psychoanalysis and Modern Life,” at Breasted Hall Tuesday evening.

The question of a criminal’s responsibility for his crimes arises, Katz explained, because
psychoanalysis postulates the determination of actions by biological and psychological forces,
while law' claims free choice of alternatives, free will for the individual. If he is forced to com-

Assuming that four miles per hour is a possible steady pace
for healthy adults, the group hopes to cover a distance of 12

mit a crime, a criminal is not
responsible for it; if he has a
moral choice and picks an im-
moral course, he is responsible.

Discusses psychotic, 'normal' criminals

In attempting to assign respon-
sibilit for crimes, Katz made use
of the analysis in The Criminal,
the Judge, and the Law by Alex-
ander and Stamm. These writers
claim that there are four types
of criminals:

1.	Psychotics—“the insane”

2.	Neurotics — act out psychic
conflicts in life with an at-
tempt to get punishment (in-
clude eccentrics as w’ell as
criminals)

3.	Normal — persons actually
well-adjusted to society, but
to a society different from the
usual: a society in which the
superego is evil; “normal”
criminals include professional
confidence men, burglars

4.	Occasional criminals — com-
mit crime in a particular situ-
ation which loosens the “con-
tract between the ego and id”
(the person who picks up a $5
bill when it is near him and
no one is looking)

All of these criminals are seen
by society as an external threat,
but also as an internal threat,
lince example arouses the id. So-
ciety therefore demands punish-
ment of all criminals. In fact, Katz
•aid, some have proposed a theory
that society needs criminals to
punish; for punishment is an act
of pure aggression.

Not responsible if insane

But some criminals escape pun-
ishment because of a lack of re-
aponsibility. Traditionally, the
legal rule has been the McNaugh-
ton Rule to determine responsi-
bility: there must be a disease of
the mind resulting in a lack of
understanding of the act.

The McNaughton Rule has been
much attacked by analysts be-
cause of its emphasis on reason.
Many proposals are now being
made to modify or replace it with'
statements like “No one should be
convicted who, at the time of com-
mitting a crime, should have been
committed to a mental institu-
tion.”

Rule placements controversial

But most replacements have
been attacked by psychiatrists,
since all criminals, “being irre-

sponsible at the time of a crime,
can be considered to be ‘forced’ to
their act.” ,

But how can we deal with the
public demand for criminal ex-
piation ? How can we reconcile law
and psychoanalysis? Katz suggest-
ed what he phrased “a crude work-
ing agreement:”

1.	lawyers to realize that free-
dom of choice is very limited.

2.	Recognition of the principle

responsibility by criminals,

the increased capacity for
responsibility psychoanalysis

Hauser predicts
pop. to increase

A population of 190,000,000

by

1970 has been predicted for the
US by Philip M. Hauser, profes-
sor of sociology and former direc-
tor of the US Bureau of Census.

By 1970, Hauser said, Chicago
will have a metropolitan area pop-
ulation of 7,000,000. The national

SECC

(from po^e 1 )
it is more likely that it will take
three years.

Tenants are protected

Tenants of slum residences will,
according to Levi, be adequately
protected when this plan is put
into effect. The relocation pro-
gram will be carried on in stages
and the SECC has 30 real estate
offices at its disposal to help ten-
ants find new homes.

Landlords on the other hand,
will be made an offer for their
property. This offer will be based
on the value which is placed on
the property by a SECC appraiser.
If the landlord does not accept the
SECC’s offer, and if negotiations
fail, then the house or apartment
building will be condemned. The
condemnation of a given piece of

These proceedings which begin in
the lowest courts may be appealed
to the State Supreme Court.

No one gets "raw deal"

Levi and others have repeatedly
emphasized the fact that "no one
will get a “raw deal.” Further-
more, any tenant or landlord who
feels that he has problems he
wishes to discuss with the SECC,
may make appointments with
members of the board during of-
fice hours set up for this purpose.

It was also learned that the
whole Hyde Park area would have
new lights by 1955 and that the
city presently is installing these
on and around the University
Campus.

Finally, police protection has, as
a result of a relocation of men in
this area, increased 40 per cent
over what it was four years ago.

complete destruction and that a
series of H-bombs would be drop-
ped four or five miles inland
from the lake.

The atomic scientists who are
studying such problems point out
that congestion and panic would
probably slow down considerably
those who try to reach safety on
foot. On the other hand, motor
vehicle traffic would probably get
completely jammed under the
present unplanned conditions. The
only hope for survival in such an
attack would be a desperate at-
tempt to get away on foot.

Anyone interested in such “air-
raid practice” is invited to join
this hike which will leave Stagg
Field, 57th and University, 9 a m..
Sunday, May 23. Those interested
merely for the sake of an enjoy-
able 16-miles conditioning hike are
also welcome. Lunches will be

Tuesday evening. This discussion
is sponsored by The Channing
Club of the Unitarian Church.

Tillich, professor of philosoph-
ical theology at Union seminary
of Columbia University in New
York, was called Protestantism’s
number one philosopher two years
ago by Time magazine, and at
Columbia has attempted to bring
together liberal and orthodox
Christianity. He has built what
has been called “one of the most
impressive Protestant theological
systems since the time of the re-
formers.” He is a member of the
Evangelical and Reformed
Church.

Dr. Tillich has recently returned
from giving the Gifford lectures
in Scotland. This position is gener-
ally considered the most distin-
guished philosophical lectureship
in the world.

Beta Theta Pi fraternity was
placed on social probation last
week in an action taken by Wil-

dent activities, and the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council. Charges were
serving beer as a main beverage
at a campus open-house and the
advertising of such a fact. The
alleged violations were committed
at the Beta “Stark” party on April
30.

Pending further inxestigation, a
final penalty for breaking the two
rules will be decided upon by the
I-F Council.

The fraternity, protesting the
action, has declared that the bev-
erage served was of a low-enough
alcoholic content to be permissible
under University regulations.

Beta president, Stephen Mc-
Grade, speaking for the group,
said, “We admit that we did vio-
late one or possible two rules, but
we think that a severe penalty
would be in excess of the offense
and we hope that it will not be
made.”

Rail magnates woo
student for proxy
by Bob March

Dave Parke, a UC student at Meadville Seminary, has
plunged into America’s “biggest rail war in a half century.”
In a bold move aiming at control of a two billion dollar cor-
poration, Parke entered the fight for the New York Central
Railroad by buying one share of common stock in the road
from the brokerage firm of Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner,
and Beane, three hours be-
fore the deadline for voting in
the May 26 stockholders’ elec-
tion.

Parke learned of the fight for
control of the railroad between
Robert Young, ex-chairman of the
C&O R.R. and the present board
of directors through an article in
Life, Feb. 8, 1954, and decided to
cast his lot with the aggressive
Young.

Though Parke would not dis-
close how deep he is in the battle
of financial titans, he is rumored
to have gained control of holdings
in excess of five dollars.

Since entering the financial
war, he has received letters plead-
ing for his proxy from Young,
James Farley, and Chairman of
the Board Harold S. Vanderbilt.

Parke described his ally Robert
Young as “A real nineteenth cen-
tury capitalist — with financial
ability, vision, imagination, and
guts.”

Dave Parke

business and religious leaders at
the Congress Hotel.

Kimpton repeated the UC offer.
“The University of Chicago is pre-
pared to reserve an adjacent block
for any denominational groups
that might wish to move here
later.

“The University also has agreed
to find appropriate housing in the
area for any and all employes of
the National Council who would
move here,” he continued.

Cost of the proposed building
would be about 2.4 million dollars.
Cost in the “Loop” would be about
three million. At present the Coun-
cil has temporary headquarters in
New York, and must decide among
sites in New York, Chicago, Cleve-
land and Columbus fur its perma-
nent headquarters.

Young launched his fight by
secretly selling his controlling in-
terest in the tiny Chesapeake and
Ohio, and carefully buying nearly
twenty per cent of Central’s com-
mon stock. Promising sharehold-
ers aggressive reforms in the
road, he hopes to gain control of
the board by obtaining enough
proxies from shareholders to win
the May 26 election.

Parke claims that holding a key
card in the tussle that is rocking
Wall Street has affected neither
his vocational plans nor his
studies.

Two UC profs
win NAS posts

Two more faculty members
were recently elected to the group
at the National Academy of Sci-
ence annual meeting in Washing-
ton, D. C., bringing the total num-
ber of UC members of the Acad-
emy to 32.

The two UC’ers are Dr. William
Bloom, professor of anatomy, and
Frank H. Westheimer, professor
of chemistry.

Membership in the Academy is
awarded on the basis of signifi-
cant work done by a candidate
during the whole of his profes-
sional career.

Westheimer’s field is organic
chemistry. In the past five years,
he has been studying the chemi-
cal reactions of the body.

Bloom specializes in the study
of the structure and development
of bone in health and disease. He
is a co-worker of Dr. Raymond E.
Zircle, who has been using a pin-
pointed beam 1/12,000 of an inch
in diameter produced by a 2,000,-
000 volt atom smasher for re-
search into vital life processes in
living cells.

Liberals protest

The recent presentation of Paul Robe-
son has been sponsored by a group
which asserts that it represents liberal-
ism on this campus. This sponsorship
has in effect .been claimed to be an
expression of liberalism.

As liberals, the writers of this letter
vigorously protest this false association.
Although we recognize and will continue
to defend SRP’s right to this activity,
we wish to express, with Birenbaum, our
disapproval. Their decision Is in con-
flict with the principles of liberalism
and is now serving to retard its cause.
We protest on the basis of both prin-
ciples and practical consideration.

On the ground of principle, we cite
the following;

1)	Liberalism is to be understood as
a force dedicated to the preservation and
expansion of the philosophy of democ-
racy. This implies that liberals are
committed to the preservation of civil
liberties—for everyone. But liberals are
not. by the same token, committed to
the support of totalitarian causes.

2)	The Communist movement is to-
talitarian in nature. It is dedicated to
the destruction of liberalism. It seems
to us that all the evidence indicates
Robeson to be a representative of this
movement. Robeson's civil liberties have
not been abused. The action of SRP is
not, therefore a defense of civil liberty.
It is avowed support of Robeson, and
Inevitably, of his cause.

3)	Therefore the action of SRP con-
stitutes a repudiation of the principles
of liberalism.

On the ground of practicality, we
cite the following:

1)	Liberal action should be designed
with the advance of democracy as the
basic intention.

2)	The results of SRP’s actions have

presentation of Robeson U tooth con-
trary to the philosophy of liberalism,
and destructive of Its mission. We are
compelled to arrive at two alternative
conclusions. Either SRP is naively un-
aware of the nature of Communism and
its design on liberalism, or else it Is
sympathetic to Robeson’s cause.

In either case we disapprove. In either
case we wish to destroy any illusion
that SRP has performed a "Jibera!”
action.

Liberalism and Communism are in-
compatible. Liberals should defend the
civil rights of Communists, but cannot
support the Communist cause.

As anti-Communist liberals, we pro-
test, not the right of SRP, but their
unwise use of that right.

Letter obscure

The phraseology in Birenbaum’s let-
ter of the May 7 issue of the MAROON
Is lost on me. I would appreciate an
interpretation of the lines “the larger
interests of the student body of the
University community.’’

NSA Regional
elects officers

At the University of Illinois in
Urbana last Saturday, UC stu-
dents Bruce Larkin and Larry
Lichtenstein were elected chair-
man and vice-chairman, respec-
tively, of the Illinois region of the
National Student Association
(NSA).

Seven Illinois schools were rep.
resented at this preCongress re-
gional NSA meeting.

The region recommended That
a national academic freedom week
be called by NSA for next year.

A delegation of Soviet students
would be invited by NSA to tour
the US under the terms of another
proposal. A resolution calling
upon NSA to further student co-
operatives was also passed.

Letters . . .

Praises Robeson

Millions of dollars are expended to
bring “enlightenment” to the peoples
behind the so-called 'Tron Curtain” of
the virtues of our democratic form of
government, of the superiority of our
way of life. Despite this vast outlay for
caste over the “Voice of America,”
propaganda, we have the rueful admis-
sion of authoritative sources that broad-
•'Voice of Free Europe’* and other media
are regarded only as entertainment fare
In these countries. People listen with
tongue in cheek mentally comparing the
wide gap between WORDS and PER-
FORMANCE.

How can it be otherwise when they
read that Paul Robeson cannot accept
an invitation to sing before a student
body at a university without encounter-
ing opposition from a prejudiced and
publicity-seeking source? The name of
Paul Robeson is honored and respected
throughout the world. To the peoples of
Europe and Asia, he symbolizes all that
Is decent and fine in our country. They
rightfully regard him as one of the
greatest artists of our time. He has sung
before most, if not all, crowned heads
of Europe. Thousands of music lovers
have been turned away at concerts be-
cause of unavailable space at the larg-
est auditoriums in Europe. Yet, this
great artist is barred from earning a
living in his own country and refused a
*lsa to leave it. This is. indeed, a strange
commentary on our democracy. Small
wonder that we can convince no one.

Mr. Robeson has been accused of be-
tog a Communist. This label Is bandied
about too freely and recklessly by those
Individuals who fear dissent; who would
supplant reason with fear, suspicion
and hate. He earned the enmity of gov-
ernment officials for opposing the war
in Korea and, moreover, for DARING

to voice his opposition. (Today, millions
are on his side.) He earned the hatred
of advocates of colonialism for exposing
the vicious degrading and inhuman
Malan policy in Africa which dooms the
people to an annual wage of less- than
$100! Por his denunciation of the “Asia-
tics io light Asiatics’* policy, Paul
Robeson won the acclamation of mil-
lions of peoples throughout the world,
and the title of “Communist”—at home.
I deem it a very great honor to have had
the privilege of hearing Mr. Robeson
sing on his all too-infrequent appear-
ances in our city.

Nellie De School

been decidedly in conflict with this
goal.

a)	It has functioned to confuse
liberalism, in many minds, with pro-
Communism. This makes it extreme-
ly easy for reactionary demagogues
to dump Stalinism, democratic So-
cialism. New Dealism, and ADAism
into the same ed basket.

b)	SRP’s action compels unsym-
pathetic liberals to take a position
in defense of SRP’s action. This
further confuses Communists with
liberals.

c)	Only Communism, not liberal-
ism, benefits from this “unholy alli-
ance.”

Seyfert removed, lab school to have 4*year high

by Fred Solomon

University High School will have a new look next fall.

The duties of the Director of the Laboratory School, a post held by Warren C. Seyfert since he left Harvard 10 years ago, will be
assumed by the recently-formed board of pre-collegiate education and by a principal /zin charge of the day-to-day administration in
the Laboratory School."

In addition to replacing
Seyfert, the board has de-
cided that, as of the academic
year 1954-55, the Lab School,
instead of terminating at grade
ten, will include an accredited
four year high school.

Return to old days

This curricular reorganization
is one which involves a return to
the “6-5” program that existed in
the Laboratory School between
1918 and 1937. Under this system
the student will have a six-year
elementary education, one “pre-
freshman” year at the seventh
grade level, and four years of high
school from the eighth through
the eleventh years.

By the end of his senior (elev-
enth) year, the student will have

About* the story

The story of the Lob School re-
organization is an important one
with many ramifications. In order
to bring the facts fully and ac-
curately, before the campus, the
MAROON asked Fred Solomon, Lab
School alumnus and president of
the class of 51, to undertake an
investigation. Behind the story as
printed here are many hours of dis-
cussion with the people involved,
including Lob School alumni, par-
ents, and students.

accumulated enough high school
credits to apply to any college he
chooses. If a student wants to
enter the college of the University
of Chicago he may apply for ad-
mission either during his tenth
(“junior”) year or one year later,
as a high school graduate.

In step with other changes

The change to a full high school
program came as no surprise to
Seyfert. Though not commenting
on the merit of the action he view-
ed the move as being “in step with
changes in other parts of the Uni-
versity,” and he pointed out that
the new college program is aimed
largely at the high school gradu-
ate.

Seyfert and the Lab School fac-
ulty members who were inter-
viewed share the impression that
the college will continue to accept
tenth grades as a “concession” to
the old plan. “It looks as if the
student who hasn’t graduated
from high school will become of
less interest to the college as time
goes on,” said Seyfert.

Chicago plan victim of mores

Harold B. Dunkel, professor of
the department of education and
director, of pre-collegiate educa-
tion feels that in view of the new
college policy it would be incon-
gruous fpr U-High not to offer
students the opportunity to obtain
full high school credit before go-
ing to college.

To Dunkel, the failure of the
“Chicago Plan” of early admis-
sions may be ascribed to Ameri-
can mores. “I personally favored
the 6-4-4 system of education, but
the 8-4-4 set-up is as deeply rooted
in the American tradition as the
two-party system,” he said.

Davey praises early entrance

On the other hand, John R.
Davey, dean of students in the
college, had firm words of praise
for the policy which has stirred
educational controversy for the
past 17 years.

“In the past, U-High graduates

BARBERS EVERYWHERE RECOMMEND WILDROOT CREAM~0ILT0 REMOVE LOOSE DANDRUFF	KEEP HAIR WELL GROOMED

have done very well in the college,
and their preparation has been
more than adequate,” said the
Dean. “In general, the early ad-
mission policy has proved very
successful, and we are proud of
the results. The students who
have entered at the eleventh and
twelfth grade levels have been
quite able to “take” going to col-
lege; the non-high school gradu-
ates have given my office no more
trouble than the older students.”

Davey was also dubious about
how the new program could be
supported as a move toward bet-
ter integration of the Lab School
with the University if it results in
fewer U-High graduates continu-
ing in the college. He explained
that before 1937 only a third of
the graduates entered the college
and that there is little reason to
expect much more than this pro-
portion to come to the college in
the future.

Not an educational advance

Davey commented, “This change
can hardly be termed an educa-
tional advance. It is, rather, a
move to satisfy those families in
which the student (or his parents)
feels sure that he does not want
to attend our college. It’s a device
by which those who want to go
away to college may complete
their high school requirements
within the Laboratory School, in-
stead of coming to the college for
one or two years.”

Dunkel used this point in justi-
fying the change pointing out that
half of the U-High graduates who
enter the college leave after earn-
ing tjieir twelfth grade certifi-
cates. However, any U-High alum-
nus knows that of the 80 per cent
of each graduating class that en-
ters the College, no more than
one-fourth can be described as
“sure” that they wanted to remain
here for their undergraduate edu-
cation; but a significant propor-
tion of the remaining three-
fourths eventually decide to stay.
College has done well by U-Highers

An example is the class which
graduated from the Lab School
in 1951: of the 45 students who
originally had planned to “go
away” after two years in the col-
lege, about twenty changed their
minds along the way and decided
to remain at the University of Chi-
cago for their general education.
Furthermore, this reporter per-
sonally knows that at least 10 of
his former classmates who did go
away are now doing “A” work at
other colleges and will testify to
anyone that their “preparation
for college” has been exceptional.
In the past, moreover, U-High
graduates have frequently re-
turned to UC for divisional work,
and, in several cases, have re-
turned to the college.

To this reporter, it also seems
doubtful that those Lab School
students who think they want to
enter tlje college will do so before
completing the full high school
program. Dean Davey commented,
“Because next year’s eleventh
grade curiculum has yet to be set-
tled, and because the change was
announced so late in the year,
nearly all of those tenth graders
whom the college has admitted
will matriculate next fall. Within
a few years, however, the whole

picture could very well change.”
He continued, “A future tenth
grader will make the popular
choice as to whether or not to
enter the college before graduat-
ing U-High. The factors influenc-
ing this decision will be primar-
ily non-educational— how much
prestige will be attached to the
senior year.”

Social factors powerful at U-High

It would seem to this reporter
that the “non-educational” factors
will probably work to retain the
students for the full four years.
The structure of the extra-curricu-
lar program is such that the stu-
dent leaders are invariably chosen
from the graduating class. Fur-
thermore, interviews have indi-
cated that a U-High faculty mem-
ber expressed the attitude of
piany of her colleagues when she
said, “Of course we are going to
want the students to stay here
and f(pish our new program.”

Seyfert on the other hand, feels
that if a student is mature
enough, intellectually and other-
wise, to be recommended to the
college at the end of tenth grade,
he should not be held back by .an-
other year of high school.
Whether this policy will be main-
tained by Seyfert’s successors,
and whether future tenth graders
will even apply to the college can-
not easily be predicted.

No integration seen

When one remembers that it
was Lab School students who

Warren C. Seyfert, director of the Lab School, in his office.

were the first “elderly admis-
sions” to the college in 1937, and
when one considers that for fif-
teen years U-High has provided
nearly half of all the early en-
trants, it is difficult not to agree
with Davey, who “can’t see that
the change to a four-year high
school will in any way improve
integration with out college.” An-
other reason for the curricular re-
organization must be found.

Dunkel may have revealed the
most important reason for chang-
ing the program when he com-
mented, “Integration with the
University does not necessarily
mean integration with the college.
The board of pre-collegiate edu-
cation must consider the interest
of the University as a whole.

“At the present time, for ex-
ample, the University is interested
in maintaining the quality of the
surrounding community. It is the
lies have moved out of the area
feeling that many desirable fami-
who might have remained in the
community if a full" high school

program had been available with-
in the highly satisfactory facili-
ties of the Lab School.”

Mrs. McKeon comments

Mrs. Richard P. McKeon, co-
chairman of the Tenth Grade Par-
ents Association, consented to
comment on this point. “It has
been our son’s decision to enter
the college next fall. But it is true
that for a number of years, many
parents of Lab School children
have felt that they would prefer
their son or daughter to stay on in
the close circles of contemporaries
found in U-High grades rather
than enter the college at an early
age. There has been doubt that
sixteen - year - olds possessed
enough social maturity to cope
with the mixed age groups found
in the college, although we have
had very little information on the
subect.”

On the topic of community serv-
ice, Seyfert claimed that the Lab
School “has done as much as any-
one could” to help save the neigh-
borhood. He insisted, however,
that neither saving the neighbor-
hood nor recruiting for the college
should be primary factors influ-
encing the policy decisions con-
cerning the Lab School.

The power to make these deci-
sions has changed hands in the ad-
ministrative reorganization which
has come, coincidentally, at the
same time as the curricular
changes.

Council of Senate voted changes

Last year the council of the fac-
ulty senate adopted the commit-
tee report which legislated Sey-
fert’s job of director of the Lab-
ortary School out of existence.
This report stated, in part, that
“educationally and organization-
ally, the Laboratory School has
steadily lost connection with the
University ... it has ceased to be
a laboratory carrying on signifi-
cant experiments.”

Dunkel expects that under the
new arrangement, various depart-
ments and individuals in the Uni-
sity will feel free to bring any
“bright ideas,” “experiments, or
research proects that they deem
worth while to the board of pre-
collegiate education for trial in
the Lab School. It is hoped that
these measures will “make the
School in actuality a University
school.”

Seyfert proud of policy

On this point, Seyfert firmly re-
iterated the policy he is “proud to
have followed” during his 10 years

as director. “The door has always
been open for anyone in the Uni-
versity to bring us his suggestions
and experiments. If the research
would not interfere with the edu-
cation or well-being of the stu-
dents, and if it would not take up
too much of their time, we’ve
usually said, ‘O.K., go ahead and
try it out.’ But the faculty and
I have never forgotten our re-
sponsibility to the students par-
ents, who pay the University good
money so that their children may
get the best, educationally.” (Lab
School tuition is $660-675.)

Dean Davey, who taught at U-
High before joining the college
faculty, commented, “I have al-
ways had the feeling that the ex-
perimentation carried on at the
Laboratory School has been well-
supervised, and usually contrib-
uted to the well-being of the stu-
dent. The experiments certainly
were never allowed to interfere
with scholastic achievement and
many of them, in fact, increased
the educational value of the Lab-
oratory School program. Under
the administration of the board,
I would hope that U-High would
continue as a good preparatory
school, as well as a center for
experimentation.”

The present composition of the
board of pre-collegiate education
includes a pediatrician, a psychol-
ogist, representatives from the
English and education depart-
ments, and a faculty member
from the coll e g e . Chancellor
Kimpton and Dunkel serve on the
board, ex-officio. Dunkel said that
in the future, policy decisions will
come from this University board,
not from professional high school
educators. “The Laboratory School
will thus be more closely inte-
grated with the University,” he
concluded.

Robeson . ..

(from page I)

Mussorgsky’s song “Orphan*
did not come off quite so well,
chiefly because the singer forgot
from time to time that he was
singing. The other works are too
numerous to mention individually
except to remark that Robeson is
past master of their performance,
and rumors that his voice has de-
teriorated were not confirmed.
Robeson’s practice of changing
the words in songs is not objec-
tionable as long as he sticks to
Jerome Kern, but the “Ode to
Joy” belongs in Beethoven’s ninth
symphony, and even the most
tasteful transcription is sacrilig-
ious to my purist ears. Beethoven
himself was unsuccessful in con-
vincing Schiller to change the
words. The matter should rest
there.

Alan Booth functioned unob-
trusively as an accompanist, but
as a soloist he is borderline medi-
ocre. His Beethoven was little
short of atrocious. Of interest is
the fact that he played some mu-
sic of New China which was
neither new nor Chinese. I should
think that among 500,000,000 peo-
ple there should be one composer
of the stature of Oscar Strauss.

'Salt of the Earth' gets 'pressure'

in production and distribution

Scheduled to open at the Hyde Park Theatre, 53rd and Lake Park Avenue, Salt of the
Earth, probably will not open because of unnamed “pressures” on both the owners and the
Moving Picture Operators Union. .

Since the Moving Picture Operators Union decided to prevent the showing of the film
at a private screening, it has subsequently taken the stand that if a theatre with a contract
with the union decides to show the picture, they will take the matter under consideration.

Critic praises film's merits;
'Salt of the Earth' moving

Salt of the Earth, a film about a miners strike in New
Mexico, played Monday in Soc Sci 122 to what in this review-
er’s experience was the most enthusiastic audience ever gath-
ered in the University community. The events leading up to
the Documentary Film Group’s showing of this film on 16mm
stock and the difficulty the film encountered in production

and is now encountering in
distribution are presented
elsewhere on this page. Any-
one who has more than a passing
interest in civil liberties and de-
mocracy in the media of mass
communication should thoroughly
familiarize himself with these
facts.

The present discussion of the
film will be restricted to those
points dealing with its position
and validity as a work of art.

Preliminary to this it is neces-
sary to dispel any misconceptions
that are operating to circumscribe
the scope and meaning of the film
by labeling it “propagandistic,”
“ideological,” “radical” or of a
“special interest” nature. In this
reviewer’s judgment the makers
of this film not only approached
their subject matter with a min-
imum of preconceptions but with
a maximum of artistic integrity
and a rare and sensitive ability
io let it speak for itself.

On fhe level of events, the film
deals with a Mexican-American
mining community in New Mex-
ico in its struggle with the oper-
ators of the mine and the strike-
breakers and the police agency
that the operators mobilize. How-
ever, the dramatic center of the
film takes place within the bounds
of this objective task: the miners
must realize that success in this
struggle can be achieved only if
they see the situation as going
beyond the immediate question of
accidents due to speed-ups in the
mines. They also must see the
situation in terms of the effects
wrought on their wives and chil-
dren and the kind of life they live
in the primitive company-owned
houses. With this grows the realiz-
ation that the struggle must be
waged by all—that the women
have the right and obligation to
participate in the strike on equal
terms with the men.

These events were given a focus
in the development in character of
one of the miners and his wife.
The roles, played by Juan Chacon,
who is a miner, and Rosaura Rev-
ueltas, a Mexican actress, gave
the film a depth and emotional
quality that in this reviewer’s
opinion has rarely been present in
American films.

The scenes showing the growth
of understanding between the
miner and his wife, arising out
of the participation of the women
in picketing and the realization
by the men of the problems the
women faced, were unforgettable

in their portrayal of genuine love
and human dignity. Especially
moving to this reviewer was the
subtle and complex characteriza-
tion by Miss Revueltas of the
miner’s wife; changing from a
position of embittered desponden-
cy to a glowing pride arising out
of meaningful participation and
accomplishment.

Structurally, the film is devel-
oped in a straightforward narra-
tive form with a minimum of com-
plicating devices; this makes the
one instance of parallel montage
overwhelmingly powerful: scenes
of the miner being viciously
beaten by sheriff’s deputies are in-
tercut with scenes of his wife in
childbirth. The effect is a bril-
liant symbolization of the unity of
the difficulties faced by both. Vis-
ually, the film was shot with an

Salt of the Earth stars the
Mexican award-winning ac-
tress, Rosaura Revueltas and
a large cast of non-professionals
recruited from among the metal
miners and was filmed in coopera-
tion with the Mine, Mill, and
Smelter Workers Union.

It was filmed near Silver City,
New Mexico, and depicts the ac-
tual events surrounding a strike
of Mexican-American workers
for better working conditions
and equality of treatment. Since
its opening in New York City it
has received excellent reviews
in the daily papers, magazines,
and the labor press throughout
the country.

In New York the picture has
been playing to capacity audi-
ences for nine weeks. It opened in
San Francisco, where the San
Francisco Chronicle called it the
“greatest film to have been made
in America.” Since May 5 it has
been playing at the Silver View
Drive-In in Silver City, New Mex-
ico. During the first four days of
its run in Silver City it received
10,800 customers from a county of
20,000. Openings are scheduled
during next week in Denver and
Los Angeles.

Michael Wilson, the writer,
came to know the New Mexican
miners—who are the prototypes
of the story—during a long and
bitter strike they waged against
the Empire Zinc Company in

1951 and
was born
there.

Because

1952. The story idea
out of his first visit

it was the union in-

volved in the strike, the Interna-
tional Union of Mine, Mill, and
Smelter Workers was asked to

.	.	sponsor the film. IUMMSW is an -

emphasis on images of sharp and ’independent union formerly affili-

penetrating realism, on location in

the area where the actual strike
occurred. Michael Wilson, noted
for his work on A Place in the
Sun, working with the miners,
evolved a script that maintains a
sharp purposefulness through a
wide range of characterizations
and situations. The film has
gained a quality of roundedness
and freshness through this inter-
action.

Director Herbert J. Biberman is
to be commended for his skill
in making the film a seamless,
rounded whole. Working under
difficult conditions, with a cast
composed in the main of non-pro-
fessionals (members of the Inter-
national Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers, Local 890), he
wisely let these people tell their
own story.

To this reviewer the film is a
courageous testament to the view
that oppression need not be crush-
ing; that action based on coopera-
tion and understanding can lead to
a proud image of Man.

ated with the CIO. Since 1915,
when Joe Hill, one of its organiz-
ers, was shot, IUMMSW has been
well known in the trade union
movement.

Shooting began January 20,
1953. On February 24, Repre-
sentative Donald Jackson, Re-
publican from California, at-
* tacked the film on the floor of

Congress as a “weapon for Rus-
sia.” Jackson indicated that he
had not read the script or ex-
amined the circumstances of the
film’s production.

Immediately after Jackson’s
speech the leading lady was ar-
rested on a charge of illegal im-
migration and eventually deport-
ed, members of the cast and crew
were physically assaulted, two un-
ion halls were burned down and a
vigilante committee sent threaten-
ing notes to the producers.

In addition to these direct in
timidations such powerful rep-
resentatives of the motion pic-
ture industry as Howard
Hughes and Roy Brewer at-
tempted to restrict the produc-

tion and exhibition of the film.

When Salt of the Earth opened
in New York City, the internation-
al president of the International
Alliance of Theatrical and Stage
Employees, the projectionists’ un-
ion, indicated that the Internation-
al would not interfere with the
presentation of the film. Never-
theless, some locals, including the
Chicago local, (the Moving Picture
Operators Union) have refused to
project the film. The American Le-
gion had planned to protest the
New York showing but when an
officer of the Legion saw the film,
he said that because the only
“istic” this film is “is feministic,
and that’s not against the law,”
the Legion would not interfere.

Toward the end of April, a
contract was signed for the ex-
hibition of the film at the Hyde
Park Theatre beginning today.
Trailers were exhibited at many
theatres in the Schoenstadt
chain of which the Hyde Park
is a part, and a display was set
up in the Hyde J’ark lobby.

One week later eighty-five in-
vited guests, including prominent
representatives of churches, labor
unions, community organizations,
the press, and educational institu-
tions assembled at the Hyde Park
Theatre for a private preview. At
this time the theatre management
was informed by the projectionist
union that it would not send a pro-
jectionist unless a two year con-
tract were signed for Saturday
matinees.

A preview was arranged for
May 5 at Igel’s Screening Room.
Arrangements were made with
the proprietor, Mr. Igel, who is
also its projectionist and a mem-
ber of the Projectionists Union,
Local 110, Chicago Moving Pic-
ture Operators Union.

The next Wednesday, Mr. Ker-
mit Russell, manager of the
Schoenstadt Theatre chain, in-
formed the representatives of In-
dependent Production Corpora-
tion Distributors, Inc., that the
Hyde Park Theatre would not ex-
hibit Salt of the Earth — certain
“pressures” had been brought.

That afternoon, several hours
later, Igel informed the distribu-
tor that the business agent of
Chicago Moving Picture Opera-
tors Union, Local 110, of which
he is a member, had ordered
him not to project the film to
the private audience that eve-
ning. Igel said he would project
the film if the ban were lifted.

A letter was sent by the dis-
tributor to the business agent of
Local 110, asking for a meeting
to discuss this matter and docu-

It was the evening after the
letter was sent and after Ear-
nest Callenbach, film reviewer
for WFMT attacked the union's
stand, that the union decided to
“Take the matter under consid-
eration.” That same evening the
film was shown to most of the
persons who had been invited to
the cancelled previews by the
Documentary Film Group here
on campus.

In a statement issued to the
press last Tuesday Herbert Biber-
man, director of Salt of the Earth
and president of IPC Distributors,
distributors of the film, said:

“We appeal to the community
and to civic, patriotic, and labor
organizations to contact the
parties concerned in this matter
to tell them they would like to
see Salt of the Earth. We also
ask the theatres of Chicago to
make their houses available to
this film. If such offers are
forthcoming, we are prepared
to show this picture.”

Saminsky dull, Ravel sparkles

Besides being on the same program, there was little similarity in the operas at Mandel Hall
last Sunday. These were “The Vision of Ariel” by Lazare Saminsky, a world premiere, and
the first Chicago performance of Ravel’s “L’Heure Espagnole.”

Although both were sponsored by the International Society for Contemporary Music, and
are being given together in various halls in the city, they had striking differences in charac-
ter, casts, and level of performance. The Saminsky is actually called an opera-ballet; there
is indeed much more ballet, “

with almost no dialogue and
only a few arias.

Although certain arias are ef-
fective, on the whole the music
is competent but uninspired,
and only forms a background
for the action. This unfortun-
ately had even more lackings;
the choreography was confused
and unrehearsed, as was the ac-
tion, and the costumes and scen-
ery were out of character.

The opera deals with the Jews
during the Spanish Inquisition.
Don Diego, or Ariel, receives a
vision while reciting the story
of Esther, during a Purim serv-
ice. He sees Esther pleading for
her people. Then he sees the
ghost of his mother, and finally
a procession of heretics escorted
by soldiers of the Inquisition.
Ariel offers up a prayer for the
innocent in a moving aria (“Av
Horachamim”); soldiers enter
the synagogue, and Ariel dies
fighting.

Lantern slides, projected on to
a backdrop, replaced formal scen-
ery. This was effective and prac-
tical, but many were poorly made,
and some' surrealistic specimens
particularly so. The costumes,
choreography and general effect
were all impressionistic, destroy-
ing the distinction between the
vision and the reality.

The solos by Norma Williams
and Sheldon Merel provided a few
parts of higher quality, but could
not save the whole production.
Admittedly the music might have
sounded better with an orchestra.

SUMMER

ISSUE

The “Ravel” was a different
matter entirely. Written to a
libretto by Franc Nouhain, it is
a delectable bit of fresh humor
and charming music. It con-
cerns an affair involving the
young wife, Concepcion (Anita
Jordan) of Torquemada, an
elderly watchmaker (Warren
Hays), with Gonzalvo, a poet
(Harold Brindell), Don Indigo
Gomez, a banker (Andrew
Foldi) and Ramiro, a muleteer
Henry Noel). The action pro-
ceeds with Gonzalvo and Don
Indigo climbing in and out of
two grandfather clocks and car-
ried up and downstairs by the

New 'Review' achieves degree of excellence;
spring-summer issue shows variety, originality

The spring-summer issue of
the Chicago Review is varied,
original, and on the whole,
achieves a considerable degree of
excellence.

The student verse shows a
marked superiority to that con-
tributed by professional poets.
William Carlos Williams’ “View
by Color Photography” and
“Wooden Flowers” by Chris
Bjerknes both employ non-met-
rical rhythms, lines of uneven
length, and an indentation which
moves the lines downward and
across the page from left to right.
Bjerknes has integrated these
visual and auditory devices with
the rest of the poem by using the
line terminations to point the nat-
ural occurrence of caesurae and
the indentations to emphasize the
falling cadences in the rhythm.
By contrast, William’s use of the
devices remains on the surface
of the poem, obscuring rather
than assisting it.

Charm is not one of the hu-
man qualities which appear
most frequently in modern
poetry, but it does appear gen-
erously in works by Ruth
Herschberger and Mrs. Blanche
Gonglewski. The former writer
has supplied a fine comic poem
on w'hat might seem an un-
promising subect for light verse
— Martin Luther. The reader
who thinks the whimsical love
poem an incompatible mixture
of the serious and the farcical
should find Mrs. Gonglewski’s
Early Love as instructive as it is
entertaining.

Jamie Redfield’s Euripides’

muscular and obliging Ramiro,
until Concepcion, bored by Gon-
zalvo’s lyrical effluviences and
Don Indigo’s pompous boring-
ness, leaves them both down-
stairs and goes to her room with
Ramiro, leaving the two unfor-

* tunates to be trapped by Tor-

quemada and made to buy the
two clocks.

The whole production was very
smooth and professional, and the
singing and acting could hardly
have been better. The last quintet,
a lampoon on Italian finales, was
a fitting climax to a delightful
production.

Vashi and Veena, Indian classical dancers, will perform traditional
dances of India in Mandel Hall at 8:30 p.m. on May 23 and 24, under
the sponsorship of the UC India Association.

Bhiru Ghami, IA social chairman, said that the dances will be of the
Bharat Natyem style, and would be of great interest to persons not
familiar with Indian art.

Vashi and Veena have appeared annually on campus for the lost four
years. Tickets are $1 and $1.50, and are available at International
House, the Reynolds Club and the Main Street Bookstore, 642 N.

“The Bacchae”: A Review is a
serious meditation upon three
ways of life and the special sig-
nificance of the way chosen by
the artist. The fluid, unhurried,
iambic line together with direct-
ness and clarity of statement ef-
fectively promotes the atmos-
phere of thoughtful calm. The
relevance of the poem to its title
is puzzling, but a line like “The
children run to school, fulfilled in
laughter” is a delight no matter
what its context.

To Gibbon is a venture in a dif-
ficult poetic form. The poet pays
tribute to another writer by in-
corporating into his own distinc-
tive work the stylistic qualities

of that writer. The problem is to
be creative and derivative; Ed-
ward Barksdale has successfully
managed both.

tainly the most exciting of the
poems are those by Janet Fis-
calini. For an Old Man, Dying
is an unconventional elegy, re-
markable for the range and in-
tensity of its emotions, which
are conveyed by a no less re-
markable richness of diction:
“A runner’s words described
your sudden rage of dying.” On
one level, Flight presents a con-
trast between the condition of
an officer in the regular army
and that of a native interpreter
who deserts. Embodied in the
two men is an opposition be-
tween a life of tedious, restrib-
tive order and a free life which
is alien to hard commands. The
contrasts in situation and idea
are reflected in the diction and
rhythm. The language at first
is terse to the point of barren-
ness, the rhythm laboring and
chopy. They modulate to some-
thing approaching the sensuous
and finally return to the quali-
ties with which they started.

One of the Review’s prize items
is Irwin Schulman’s short story,
Young Man’s Fancy. A character
study of a man incapable of fall-
ing in love, the story achieves
in a very small compass a remark-
able fullness and intelligibility for
its central figure. Given the space
which Schulman has allowed him-
self, it is hard to see how it could
have been better used.

The Search, by F. N. Karmatz,
concerns a crtical moment in
the lives of four members of the
navy air force. Guilt and sus-
picion attached to an unsolved
crime cause tensions to mount
until the chief suspect reaches
an understanding of what really
happened in the past. An excel-

lent conception has been marred
by a disunction of character
and action: the solution goes not
seem to flow inevitably from
what we have learned of the
men and invites us to entertain
attitude that have not been ade-
quately prepared for.

The Review’s graphic arts sec-
tion has been augmented until it
is now a maor source of interest
Of particular notice are the four
section-heads by Joseph Pincus.
Using pen and ink drawings over-
laid with irregular smears of ink,
Pincus has created a group of mu-
cisians whose gentle and fantastic
humor provide the magazine with
some of its most engaging quali-
ties.

Five sketches of Paul Klee
which have not been previously
published in this country, appear
together with a commentary by
Will Grohmann. While the draw-
ings will not come as either a reve-
lation or a shock to those already
familiar with Klee’s brand of wit,
they are still sufficiently fresh
and revolutionary to make the
commentary an instructive com-
plement.

Quite different from either
Pincus or Klee are the illustra-
tions by Nikos Ghika for The
Odyssey of Nikos Kazantzakis.
Ghika has imported the classical
setting of the book into his
drawings by the use of a hard,
incisive line and deliberately
archaic distortion of anatomy.
However, the grotesque vio-
lence of his subjects (also in
keeping with the book) pro-
duces a total effect which is
more medieval than classical
and more Grand Guignol than
. either.

Selections from Kazantzakis*
continuation of the Odyssey ap-
pear in the fiction section. Taking
up the story at the point where
Ulysses returns to Ithaca, he has
added a series of new episodes in
a poetic style which Kimon Friar’s
very readable translation repre-
sents as combining the Homeric
qualities of simplicity and stateli-
ness. Unfortunately the portions
of the work which are given the
reader leave the most important
question unanswered: Does this
rewriting of the Odyssey have a
purpose beyond serving as a dis-
play piece for Kazantzakis’ power
of original imitation?

The essay section offers de-

by Professor Charles Hart-
shorne and Ludwig Wittgen-

as their aim the statement of
the respective philosophers*
leading ideas and an application
of these ideas to some major
philosophical problems. The ab-

UT presents excellent production;
three plays best in entire career

Last weekend University Theatre presented what was probably the most accomplished
even ng’s entertainment of its entire career. The program of three one-act plays will be re-
peated this weekend, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, at 8:30 p.m. in the Reynolds Club Thea-
tre - - and it is the pleasure of this reviewer to urge everyone to attend.

First on the program is a light and inconsequential comedy-farce by John Morton, deal-
ing w ith the housing situation and who’s engaged’to Penelope, entitled Box and Cox. Though

it lacks what one might call
finesse, it is not unentertain-
ing. Barry Sherman and Eddie
Simmons, in their roles respective-
ly of Mr. Box and Mr.'Cox, achieve
a valid interpretation, although
they lack control in execution.
Carol Horning fills the require-
ments of the cockney landlady
with satisfaction.

But “Aria da Capo” is pretty

Glee Club

damn good. Considered by many
to be one of the finest one-actors
ever written, Edna St Vincent
Millay’s one-act fantasy in verse
deals with those peculiar frailties
of the human race which lead to

toperform

The contrast of early sixteenth
century polyphony with nine-
teenth century romanticism will
be the highlight of the spring
quarter concert by the University
Glee Club today in Ida Noyes
Cloister Club at 8 p.m.

Featured works of the evening
are two widely different musical
settings for the liturgical hymn
“Stabat Mater,” one by Josquin
Des Pres, sixteenth century
Ft ench composer of many masses

Edna St. Vincent Millay

and motets, and the other by Giu-
seppe Verdi of nineteenth century
Italian opera fame. French horn
soloist with the glee club in the
Des Pres “Stabat Mater” will be

Edward Shepherd. Pianist William
Hutchinson will accompany the
Verdi “Stabat Mater.”

Appearing for the first time un-
der the direction of Peter Gram
Swing of the humanities I staff,
the glee club opens the concert
with three Bach chorales, “Break

forth, O beauteous heavenly
light,” “From deepest grief.” and
“Rejoice and Sing.” The latter two
chorales have been specially edit-
ed by Swing, as has the Des Pres
"Stabat Mater,” which is next in
the program.

After a short intermission the
Glee Club will return to perform
the Verdi “Stabat Mater.” The con-

cert will be concluded in a lighter
vein with a Handel chorus from
‘TAllegro,” a Hampshire folk-
song “Swansea Town,” Irving
Fine’s setting of “Father Wil-
liam’ from Alice in Wonderland,
and two choruses “When I go out
of door” and “After much debate
internal” from Patience by Gilbert
and Sullivan.

In several of the last numbers
Hutchinson will be joined at the
piano by Jim Maynard of the Glee
Club in four hand accompani-
ments.

suspicion, hatred, and war. It de-
scribes a classical situation in
which a children’s game becomes,
a game of death while Pierrot and
Columbine represent the apathetic
attitudes of our society. Perhaps
one of the reasons it is not better
known is that it is by no means an
easy play to perform. The entire
UT cast deserves the highest
praise for their well interpreted
and very moving portrayals. Spe-
cial laurels go to Catherine Allison
and Hayme Bernson for their
renditions of the shepherdess and
Cothurnus, respectively.

The appearance in the play of
this death-like apparation, Cothur-
nus, produces an atmosphere of
hush and submission. One could
not imagine anything that could
be added to Bernson’s portrayal,
for his appearance brought shiv-
ers to the backbones of the best.

Camera Club rates artistic merit

The UC Comera Club s onnual exhibit, shown in the Reynolds Club this week, shows on improvement
over even lost yeor s excellent exhibition.

T^e mo^ noticeoble improvement is in technique, especially in the darkroom. Nearly every photograph
exhibited is superior in this respect. But, even more important, the Camera Club has maintained high

prizes on the basis of technical fac-
tors. First prize went to a study of
a potters hands by G. Flaum.
Though well done technically, the
photograph’s treatment of an in-
teresting subject matter leaves
much to be desired. A very inter-
esting photo of a stevedore by the
same artist was overlooked by the
judges, despite its vivid and dy-
namic treatment of subject mas-
ter.

The second prize photograph, a
portrait of a young girl by Jim

Whitman, is an excellent salon
portrait.

Third prize went to Carl Stof-
fels for a rather drab study of a
girl. The prize is almost an in-
sult to Mr. Stoffels, who exhib-
ited two excellent portraits tak-
en France — "Patriarch,” (an
elderly farmer) and “Merchant-
Oise.” These are both fine ex-
amples of the power of the cam-
era as a portrait instrument By
careful selection of subject, and

po^ing him in his environment
ui a way that clearly points up
his personalty through his rela-
tion to that environment, Stof-
fels creates a true work of art,
rather a flattering likeness or
study in tones of grey. It is
unbelievable that a competent
critic could overlook exhibits of
such obvious artistic merit.

Honorable mention went to a
study of a Negro child by the first-
prize winner, Flaum. The photo-

Weigh future of

JV athletics

by Palmer Pinney

Will the new college plan cause a decline in junior varsity
sports?

Will there be a significant drop in the number of students
eligible for junior competition?

From events of the past year, it doesn’t seem unlikely. Dur-
ing the past season, three JV teams have been particularly
weak. In baseball, no practice sessions or games were held.
The swimmers lost their sole meet to Mount Carmel, 15-60;
the fencing team dropped their only meet, an unofficial one,
to Culver, 6-19. In all these sports coaching and facilities were
available, but insufficient student interest prevented a full
schedule.

According to athletic director, T. Nelson Metcalf, the ath-
letic department next year is “planning to proceed with JV
teams to the extent that interest warrants.” Coaching and
facilities in all 11 junior sports will again be available, and
there will be no official curtailment of the program. Whether
or not there will be a decline in JV sports depends entirely on
student participation.

T. Nelson Metcalf ... If this participation should fall off, the program might be

Trackmen tie Teachers,
take second at Elmhurst

by Justin Johnson

Coach Ted Haydon’s spiked speedsters continued to bring fame and glory to the UC dur-
ing the past week as they placed second in the Elmhurst College Twentieth Annual Invita-
tional Meet on Saturday and then journey to the land of sky blue waters to tie Wisconsin
State Teachers College in a dual contest last Wednesday.

With 19 schools competing, the Maroonmen were bested only by Michigan State Normal in

and a dwindling of eligible college students might combine to
cause U-High teams to actually be composed of U-Highers.
This shift is only one of a number of possible solutions to a
problem that will not be apparent, if at all, until next year,
Metcalf said.

Varsity teams seem secure for another year, but club sports
may see some changes. The sailing club might become an offi-
cial minor sport. Monogram awards are being given to the
sailors instead of official letters. Again, official recognition
depends on student interest.

The rifle, hockey, and squash clubs will continue their pro-
grams next year, and weight-lifting, handball, and volleyball
may become club sports. Here, as with JV sports, the future
is uncertain.

the Elmhurst meet, returning

Regulars absent

Haydon's run-for-funners
proved once again that they
are not a one-man team, since,
competing without several of the
team regulars, they came from be-
hind in the last events to gain a
65%-65 >2 tie with Wisconsin State.
Frank Loomos led the 13 Chicago
•corers, winning both the 100 yard
dash and the low hurdles and fin-
ishing second in the 220 yard dash
to total 13 points. Art Omohundro
demonstrated that his mile victory
•f last week was no fluke by turn-

their third team trophy of the

ing in a 4:32.6 performance to
take first in the 4-lap event

Teammate Hal Higdon picked
up second in the mile, helping
Omohundro all the way with
smart track strategy. Higdon
came back to win the 880 just
minutes later, this time leaving
second place for Maroonman Ar-
nie Meardon.

Howard wins shot-put

Jim Flynn and Paul Baptist
emphasized Chicago supremacy
in the distance events by finish-
ing 1-2 in the two mile. The always

year to the Bartlett showroom,
dependable weightman, Joe How-
ard, took his specialty, the shot-
put, with a heave of 42' 11% *.

The most exciting event of the
meet was the final mile-relay
where Haydon, utilizing his run-
ners to their fullest capacities,
elected to run Higdon and Omo-
hundro (both distance men) along
with Andy Thomas and Morgan
Damerow. Thomas led off with his
best quarter of the year, passing
to Higdon just three yards back
of the Wisconsin lead-off man.

See "Trackmen," page 11

Hal Higdon . . .

... is the star miler on Ted Hay-
don’s squad. When Higdon feels
in an exuberant mood, he wins
both mile and two mile races. He
was recently heard muttering
something about being foiled by
a stair-railing—or was it a Ban-
nister?

The stockyards are some
miles away, but Stagg Field
was transformed into a
slaughterhouse as the junior var-
sity trackmen rolled over Hyde
Park High, 80 2/3-18 1/3, Monday.

Because game time was
changed, Chuck Youse, the shot-
putter, missed the meet, giving
Hyde Park their only first place
*n 11 events. Lynn Small took
first place in the 100 and 220 yard
dashes and the high-jump to score
15 points. Mitch Watkins was high
scorer with first places in both
hurdles, and in the high jump and
seconds in the pole vault and shot-
put, to score 22 points.

Other firsts went to Dave
Northrup in the pole vault, Mike
Binyon with a slow 5:25.5 mile,
Pete Clarke in the 440 and John
Saada in the 880.

Saturday, Jim Brown and Lynn
Small, running at Kankakee, took
first places in the 440 and 220
yard dashes, respectively, to qual-
ify for the State finals.

He jests at scars . . .

. . . that never felt a wound,”
wrote the Bard. But cinemactor
Charleton Heston suffers neither
scars nor wounds from his duel-
ing—epee lessons from UC fenc-
ing coach Alvar Hermanson.

Romeo and Juliet first enticed
Heston to grasp a foil and don a
mask at Bartlett Gym. While ap-
pearing in Anna Lucasta in 1946,
he and other members of the cast
learned fencing fundamentals as
preparation for a forthcoming pro-
duction of Shakespeare’s play.

Throughout the winter and
spring quarters this year, Heston,
clad in a custom-made costume,
arrived an average of one evening
a week to parry and thrust with
Hermanson. Only last week were
the lessons interrupted. The 20th
Century-Fox star returned to Hol-
lywood for his next production.

Heston may not have reached
the swashbuckling stage of Doug-
las Fairbanks or Stewart Granger,
but Hermanson says, “He’s not a
bad fencer, as actors go.”

to Teachers

The weatherman and Chi-
cago Teachers College con-
spired to stop the Maroon
baseball team last week—in the
former case from playing, in the
latter from scoring more than two
runs.

The Chicago nine was dressed
and prepared for baseball Satur-
day, but the weather was unfavor-
able. Though postmen may brave
rain, snow, sleet and storm the
Saint Joseph team was unwilling
and the game was canceled.

At Stagg Field Tuesday—where
the Maroons were the “visiting”
team — Chicago Teachers College
thwarted, for five innings, every
Maroon attempt to score. Slow-
footed running didn’t help Chi-
cago efforts.

The Teachers’ baserunners cap-
italized on the wild pitches of John
Broyles and the off-base throwing
of catcher Gil Levine. Final score
was Teachers 6, Chicago 2.

Both Higdon and Omohundro ran
tremendous quarters, bringing the
baton to anchor-man Damerow al-
most even with their opposition.
Damerow proceeded to catch the
Wisconsin runner but in the final
stretch bid was unable to match
the kick of Wisconsin’s ace quar-
ter-miler. Even though the relay
team lost, they pasted the second-
fastest time of a Chicago team
outdoors, 3:28.7, justifying Hay-
don’s wisdom in running his
milers in the relay.

Pier triumphs
in rout, 17'5

In a contest that featured 22
runs, 18 hits, seven errors;
Walt Walker being knocked un-
conscious by a pitched ball; and
certerfielder Jerry Couture dis-
appearing in the middle of the
game, the Illini from Navy-Pier
waltzed to victory yesterday
afternoon, 17-5.

Pitchers on both sides were
wild and the fielders butter-
fingered, but Navy Pier took
advantage of Maroon shortcom-
ings to push across 10 runs in
the fourth inning. Best Chicago
hit was Gil Levine’s ninth in-
ning homerun.

After the game second-base-
man Brtlce Colby commented,
“When we blow one we really
blow it good.”

Faculty, B-J
clash today

It will be a battle between youth
and age this afternoon as the
Burton-Judson softball champions
battle a team of faculty members.
In the past this annual battle
has been the scene of many pot-
bellies bouncing, many errors and
many students heckling their fa-
vorite professors.

Mathews House is the, student
contender in this battle, having
defeated Mead House Wednesday
to continue their undefeated rec-
ord.

Game time is 3:30 p.m. on the
B-J diamond.

THESE ARE THE

R/^S Of
C^mplonship
'Tennis



The Tennis Twins (Spalding-made) are unmatched
in their record in top tournament play. And here is
the clinching proof: The Wright & Ditson is the only
official tennis ball used in all U.S.L.T.A. National
Championships (since 1887). Official, too, in all U^S.
Davu Cup Matches. Official adoptions of its twin,
the Spalding, in other leading tournaments assure
their championship stature in American tennis. Play
the championship twins to your own advantage.
