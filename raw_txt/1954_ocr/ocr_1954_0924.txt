Entrant Increase

4*25 entering freshmen end their twenty-three hour battery
of placement tests this afternoon. During the past four days
th*’ new students have gone through the mill of orientation
week activities — tests, tours, talks and the meeting of new
friends and becoming adjusted to the new University environ-
ment.

These 425 students represent an increase of 110 over last
year. The number of entrants in the graduate divisions of
the University has also increased over last year, according to
Registrar William E. Scott.

Total Enrollment Same

Tie large number of graduating students last spring was
originally expected to minimize the effects of the increased
number of entrants. But the awaited two per cent decrease
in total enrollment is not anticipated at present. 1954’s enroll-
ment will be approximately the same as that of 1953.

Graduate registration will not end until Monday, so exact
figures are not now available.

sity who is in Europe visiting

Greetings to the men and
women who this week begin their
academic careers at the Univer-
sity of Chicago.

Chicago students pride them-
selves on preserving few of the
symbolic traditions of the aca-
demic world.

Tradition is strong at Chicago,
nonetheless. It is a tradition for
democratic social life; for frank
and free discussions; for a real
and true concern for learning: for
impatience with sham; for the
liberty and dignity of the indi-
vidual.

We invite you to engage freely
and fully in this glorious heritage,
believing that you will soon feel
pride in Chicago's tradition.

Our welcome to you is genuine
and sincere.

Libby Leaving UC,

Accepts AEC Post

By Alice Bloom

Dr. Willar Frank Libby, professor of chemistry in the UC Institute of Nuclear Studies
since 1950, leaves the University Thursday to accept President Eisenhower’s appointment
to the Atomic Energy commission.

He will assume the responsibilities of Dr. Henry D. Smyth, who resigned.

In 1950 Libby won acclaim as the originator of Carbon 14, method for determining the
age of organic material, such as fossil remaias. This measuring principle involved is to deter-
mine the radio-activity of the material.

Libby is one of the discovers of tritium, an esential material used for the hydrogen bomb.

The recent appointment of congress reconvenes in January, statement concerning his appoint-
Libby to the AEC is subject His term will expire June 30.1956. ment:

to Senate confirmation after Libby issued the following “The appointment to the Atom-

Phi Delta Theta fraternity is now able to comply with
University membership requirements. The only “Michigan
plan” on campus Is now* settled.

At the end of the 1954 Spring quarter, Phi Delta Theta was
the last remaining student organization which had not met
Student Government (SG) requirements banning considera-
tion for membership on the basis of “race, color or creed.”

Last spring SG passed an
amendment to the student
code which was signed by Rob-
ert M. Strozier, dean of students.
The amendment set October 15,
1954, as the deadline for meeting
the regulations.

Inform Dean, SG

Harris Hartzler, chapter presi-
dent, informed Dean Strozier and
SG of the change. The new clause
was voted at the fraternity's na-
tional convention September 1-4

at Mackinac, Michigan.

Hartzler, however, in accord-
ance with the fraternity’s consti-
tution, refused to divulge the new
wording. Fraternity regulations
state that the constitution is
“secret.”

He was sharply critical of pres-
sures which were brought to bear
upon the fraternity’s local chap-
ter by Student Government.

Towle Denied Fulbright

Dr. Charlotte Towle has been denied a Fulbright scholarship by
the foreign scholarship board in Washington. The London School of
Economics had asked her to spend a year in London directing a
case work program.

The scholarship for the internationally known Social Service Ad-
winist ration professor had previously been approved by three sepa-
rate boards. Frederick L. Hovde, president of Purdue University,
who heads the scholarship board gave no reason for the refusal.

It is believed that her name was struck from the approved list
because she signed a petition urging clemency for the Rosenbergs
and because she had been a member of an organization advocating
aid to the Spanish loyalists.

Two British members of the Fulbright board have resigned in pro-
test. However, it is generally believed there is still a chance of the
scholarship being approved. Professor Towle was not available for
comment.

Willard F. Libby . . .

. , . the UC professor of chemistry in the Institute of Nuclear
Studies, who devised the carbon 14 method of determining the age
of archaeological objects. Libby is leaving the University to accept
an appointment to the US Atomic Energy commission.

ic Energy Commission is the
highest honor I have ever re-
ceived. The portentous issues of
the atomic age give the commis-
sion the opportunity to serve the
nation and mankind in an unprec-
edented way.

“It is my sincere hope that all
of the decisions with which I may
in the future be associated will
prove to be wise and will give
those who have expressed such
great confidence in me no cause
for regret.”

Had California Post

A native of Grand Valley, Colo-
rado, Libby attended the Univer-
sity of California. He received his
Ph.D. degree in chemistry at
California in 1933. He attained the
position of associate professor of
chemistry there before he re-
signed in 1945 to come to Chicago.

During the waj he was a mem-
ber of the Manhattan project
which designed the atomic bomb.
In 1950 President Truman named
him to the AEC general advisory
committee.

Libby is a member of the Na-
tional Academy of Science, the
American Physics society, the
American Chemical society, Phi
Beta Kappa, Pi Mu Epsilon, Alpha
Chi Sigma and Sigma Xi.

While at Chicago Libby and his
wife Leonor and their two daugh-

NS A Rejects US-Soviet
Exchange at Ames Meet
by Leslie Foster

Student action on academic freedom, international student cooperation, and improved
self-government highlighted the seventh annual Congress of the US National Student asso-
ciation (NSA) at Ames, Iowa, August 22-31.

The Congress adopted a resolution, strongly supported by Clive S. Gray, UC Student Gov-
ernment president, which authorized NSA officials to support student exchange programs.

A second resolution, urged by Richard E. Ward, head of the IC delegation, was defeated,

235-69. It specifically named
the Soviet Union and other
communist countries as par-
ticipants in an exchange plan.

An estimated 700 students from
250 colleges and universities
throughout the U. S. participated
in the Congress, which serves as
a workshop for campus govern-
ment and as the supreme legisla-
tive body for NSA. Faculty and
administrative perfonnei, campus
editors, and students from 23
countries abroad also attended.

DCers Split

More on NSA
Next Week

A complete report on the
Seventh Annual Congress of
the National Student Associa-
tion will be published in the
MAROON next Friday.

The report will be written by
members of the UC delegation.
Excerpts from important reso-
lutions will also be printed.

seminar at Cambridge, Massachu-
setts, studying the question of
how to counter communist efforts
to control youth movements
throughout the world.

NSA Important

Both Gray and Ward felt that

the NSA congress is an increas-
ingly important organization
shaking for the American siu-
dent community. They said it is
demonstrating its worth by pro.
viding a medium for students io
express- themselves on matters
which affect them as students.

University of Chicago delegates
attending the congress were;
Ward, Lawrence Lichtenstein, Al-
bert NT. Fortier Jr., Janice Met roc,
Gray. Bruce Larkin attended as
chairman of the Illinois region
of NSA.

The six UC votes were split
along ISL-SRP lines on the stu-
dent exchange issue. Gray said
that the resolution which passed
does not exclude student ex-
changes with communist coun-
tries. However, he feels that stu-
dents from these countries have
demonstrated that they are not
at this time capable of the free
interchange of ideas and the mu-
tual understanding which he feels
is the purpose of such a program.

Ward, who was one of the stu-
dent officers who recently visited
the Soviet Union, argued that the
effect of the resolution would be
to bar exchange programs with
communist countries. Instead, he
said, he favors such programs
wherever they were possible. He
believes the defeated resolution,
naming communist countries spe-
cifically, would be “one of our con-
tributions, as students, to secure
a peaceful world.”

Further actions taken by the
Congress were:

1)	Academic Freedom: Passed a
resolution slating that “in almost
every case” present membership
in subversive organizations de-
stroys a professor’s ability to
teach, but maintained that each
ease should be judged individually
by faculty involved. The UC group
voted affirmatively. However,
Ward said SRP disagreed with
portions of it, but felt that this
was the best resolution they
would be able to obtain.

2)	International Student Coop-
erat ion: Passed a resolution
strongly supporting the Interna-
tional Student Conference, and
condemned the allegedly commu-
nist-run International Union of
Students as “a partisan political
organization with numerous stu-
dent splinter groups.” Again the
UC group voted affirmatively.
Gray felt the IUS is a fraud which
should be ignored. He said it was
properly termed “the student sec-
tion of the Cominform.”

3)	Segregation: Endorsed, 285-4,
a special committee report ini-
tialed by southern schools calling
foi' an immediate end to segrega-
tion in all institutions of higher
education, and outlined steps by
which students might help
achieve this transition on indi-
vidual campuses. The Chicago
delegation again voted aye.

4)	Probes: Heard Senator Guy
Gillette (Dem.-Iowa) attack con-
gressional investigations of uni-
versities as acts of “power seek-
ing demagogs claiming to act in
the name of anti-communism.”

Gray was chosen by the NSA
national executive committee as
the NSA delegate on the National
Committee for UNESCO. Gray
had spent the summer at an NSA

Alternates attending the NSA
Congress for UC were Carolyn
Eggert, Lyn Burns, Barbara Vo-
gelfanger. Fred Solomon, Shirley
Long, and Robert Floyd,

All UC delegates and alternates
were elected by an all-campus
election last Spring.

Varren Dedicates
ABA Center Here

by Paul Hoffman

The newest building on campus, the American Bar association’s center,
was dedicated in a colorful ceremony last month by Earl Warren, chief
justice of the United States.

Warren, speaking in Rockefeller chapel across the Midway from the bar
center, said “it is fitting that we have this dedicatory service in a house
of God.” .

Ue said it was also fitting that the bar center is near “one of the great
uni versities of the world ... a-----------------------------------------—~

constant reminder to us to in-
sist upon man’s right to knowi-
edgo and the free use thereof, the
right to explore at will, to dis-
agree with, and even to dissent
from, the opinions of the major-

“If we are to achieve a peace-
ful world,” Warren asserted, “it
will tie accomplished through
Meas rather than armaments,
through a sense of justice and
mutual friendship rather than
with guns and bombs and guided

The chief justice explained that
lawyers could use the center to
learn Io “apply to ever changing
conditions the never changing
principles of freedom.” Warren
stated that perfection in govern-

merit is never permanently

‘Struggie for Freedoms’

Ite elaborated: “We believe that
so long as human nature is such
as it is, there must be a constant
struggle to preserve our freedoms.
We do not propose to let nature
take its course.

“On the contrary, we are de-
termined here to create the cli-
mate essential to the constant im-
provement of both the text of our
law and its application to the af-
fairs of the people.’’

The chief, justice cited some
shortcomings in American judi-
cial administration: “As lawyers,
we know better than most that
there are defects in our adminis-
tration of justice. With adequate

strengthen our

research we can

leadership in remedying them.

‘We Know Defects*

“Some of these defects we now
know. We know that in some
parts of our country a citizen can-
not have his case tried within
four years. We know this situa-
tion means a denial of justice to
litigants.

“We know also that millions of
people are financially unable to
obtain adequate legal advice or to
protect their rights in the courts,
and that this too is a denial of
justice.”

Warren mentioned other diffi-
culties: “We know that civil liber-

Judges and Justices ... ’

ABA center. Third from left In front row is -fudge Harold Medina who presided

ered the dedication address in Rockefeller chapel.

ties are too often violated and
that whenever that occurs, some-
thing is chipped away from the
foundation of our institutions.

Cites Remnants

“We know that in some states a
man charged with a felony is not
guaranteed the services of a law-
yer. We realize that is a remnant
of another day .”

The chief justice then drew at-
tention to defects resulting from
lawyer conduct : “We are sensitive
to the fact that technicalities,
anachronisms and lack of uni-
formity in the law still beset us in
the ascertainment of facts, and
that haphazard methods of ap

pointing judges, inadequate court
procedures and loose courtroom
practices too often cause delay,
confusion, inefficiency and con-
sequent expense.

“We are regretfully aware that
lawyer conduct often contributes
to these unfortunate conditions.
As a profession we do not seek to
avoid responsibility for it. We will
not sweep the dust under tiie
rug”

‘Face Problems’

Tn the bar center, Warren said,
“we can honestly face all our fam-
ily problems.” He mentioned that

tion’s lawyers were members of
the ABA. He urged those who
were unaffiliated to join 'the as-
sociation “in a great crusade” for
better legal administration.

Earlier William J. Jameson of
Billings, Montana, the ABA presi-
dent who presided at the dedica-
tion, read a letter from President
Eisenhower, which said in part:

“The dedication of the Ameri-
can Bar center is an important
milestone. Its lasting foundation
lies in the devotion of its members
to the ideals of their profession:
justice and equality to all; and
government by law. not men.

‘Influenced Thinking’

“The association has profoundly
influenced legal thinking and leg-
islation in this country; it has
sought to protect our people
against unethical practices and to
bring about a better administra-
tion of justice.

“Now in a world in which men’s
minds are flooded with propa-
ganda, distortion of the truth and
demogoguery, your organization
faces a new and truly awesome
responsibility.

Wishes Success

The President concluded his let-
ter: “As you dedicate this new
bar center. I sent you my earnest
hope for your heroic success in
this great task.”

Henry F. Tenney, vice-chair-
man of the University’s board of
trustees, welcomed the bar center
to campus and wished it a “long,
happy and prosperous life.”

All the judges and justices wore
judicial robes, but because War-

Over 2,200 persons filled the

Church Council Delegates

Speak, Preach Here, Also

by Elaine Pom per

Delegates to the World Council of Churches in Evanston found a convenient stopover
at the University of Chicago last August. Among these visitors were eight clergymen from
Eastern European nations.

The restricted visas of several permitted them only to sleep and eat breakfast at UC be-
fore they drove to Northwestern University. The Hungarians and Czechs in the group de-
clined attempts to be interviewed. 

and benediction. Music was pro-
vided by Heinrich Fleischer, the
chapel organist, and by the UC
choir which Fleischer also direct-
ed.

Most colorful part of the cere-
monies was the procession of legal
and judicial dignitaries. Original-
ly, 500 people were scheduled to
march from Ida Noyes hall to the
chapel, but only 284 arrived.

Leading the procession were
presidents of state and local bar
associations and chairmen of the

Prominent in the group
were Bishop John Peter of the
Reformed Church of Hungary
and Dr. J. L. Hromadka of the
Evangelical Church of the Czech
Brethren.

Preaches Sermon

Speaking at Rockefeller Chapel
the Reverend Hromadka discussed
the diversity of views on political
and social matters, “but if we can
get together on the dogma of
Christ Jesus, all of a sudden we
will find our prejudices toward
each other disappearing.”

Reverend Hromadka’s view is
that disparities in belief may di-
vide the world, but the doctrine of
Christ will unite it.

Kraemer Speaks

“With naive directness the Bible
discloses that the real meaning of
life is the personal encounter be-
tween God and man,” said Dr.
Hendrik Kraemer, head of the
Ecumenical Institute, when he
spoke at the University Church of
Disciples of Christ.

The Ecumenical Institute is op-
erated by the World Council of
Churches in an old Swiss chalet in
Bossey. The institute has been
visited by nearly 5,000 theologians
and laymen who have studied
there since 1946.

Dr. Kraemer is also vice-chair-
man of the International Mission
ary Council, the ecumenical group
that originally nurtured the World
Council.

‘Future Belongs to God’

Another address delivered at
UC was by Bishop J. E. Lesslie
Newbigin, former Church of Scot-
land missionary in South Indian.
“Probably the weakest spot in the
modern Christian’s makeup is that
he doesn’t hope confidently
enough, said Bishop Newbigin.
But the reason for hope or confi-
dence is ‘That God’s beachhead in
the world was established with
the coming of Jesus Christ. . . .
The future belong to God,’ so
that when looking ahead, ‘we see
that, not a question-mark.”

The bishop, who also helped
organize the Church of South In-
dia in which Angelicans, Presby-
terians, Methodists and Congre-
gationalists united in 1947, cited
that church as exemplifying what
is possible when denominations
examine whether separate exist-
ence can be justified.

Religion Not Opium

Contrasting with the tone of
other speakers Bishop Anders Ny-
gren of Lund, Sweden, warned

that the message of the Evanston
assembly must not be taken as
“opium for the world.” He rea-
soned, “The world is full of
utopias and false hopes.

“To present Christ as the One
who better than anyone else could
guarantee the hopes of the world
would be to deceive the world.”
But there is a connection between
Christian hope and worldly tasks,
“Just as Christ, the Lord’s serv-
ant, took up His service in the
world, he who has his hope in
Christ has to carry out the service
of love in His spirit. Even though
he fad, in a world sense, he has
not lost hope.”

James R. Lawson, carilloneur
of Rockefeller Chapel, extending
a ringing welcome to the World
Council of Churches, gave several
carillon recitals. One of these in
honor of Reverend Hromadka was
a recital of Czechoslovakian mu-
sic. Other recitals by Lawson
w^re offered for the dedicatory
services of the new American Bar
Association center on the Midway.

Proxy Papa
DeLee Says

Some UC doctor, intern or
medical student is the father (by
proxy) of the disputed baby in
the Ohlson case, Dr. Sol T. DeLee,
gynecologist at Lying-In hospital,
testified this week.

Mr. Ohlson is suing his divorced
wife to prevent her from calling
the child a “test-tube” baby. Mrs.’
Ohlson submitted to artifical in-
semination at Lying-In in March,
1950. Ohlson contends the child
is his, but Dr. DeLee says this is
unlikely.

DeLee added that he has super-
vised artificial insemination in 200
to 300 cases. Records of donors
are not kept, he added.

The case has been recessed un-
til November 4, while lawyers and
the judge discuss the possibility
of administering lie detector and
blood tests to both parties.

Elementary and high-school teachers working toward master’s de-
grees in the education department are currently being gwen a half-
tuition remission.

This new rate is offered by the University as a contribution to meet
the emergency caused by the shortage of school teachers, Francis S.
Chase, education department chairman, said. The remissions have
been approved by the board of trustees.

Another move to offset the teacher shortage is being started this
fall. This move is a one year course to prepare students for elemen-
tary school teaching.

Course study is in an integrated seminar unit. During the first year
of its operation the program is limited to 25 students who must have
received bachelor’s degrees within the past 15 years, but who have
had no previous professional training.

Frosh Rejects
Prof's Virility

An older student at a dining
table discussion with a new en-
trant was telling the freshman
about her advisor: “He’s very
nice. He smokes a pipe and plays
tennis well.”

“I’m not interested In his viril-
ity.” replied the newcomer, “how
is he as an advisor.”

UC Professors Received Honors

... for their services this month. Joseph D. Lohman (left), lecturer
in sociology was awarded the medal of freedom by order of Presi-
dent Eisenhower. Lohman, Democratic candidate for sheriff of
Cook county, received the citation for his work in the repatriation
of American prisoners of-war in Korea.

Harold C. Urey (right), Martin A. Ryerson distinguished service
professor of chemistry, was awarded the honor scroll of the Chi-
cago chapter of the American Institute of Chemists. The scroll, to
be presented October 8, is given for contributions to the chemists
profession and community. Urey received the honor for “his effec-
tive work and active devotion to the thesis that scientists have
obligations to society as citizens.”

Jacques Maritain, visiting professor of French philosophy and
culture in the committee on social thought, will deliver a two-part
lecture and lead a seminar on “Tolerance — its meaning and prac-
tical implication.”

Maritain, the noted Thomist philosopher, will give the series on
successive Thursdays, October 7 and 14, in Social Sciences 122
from 4 to 6 p.m.

Edward Rosheim Jr., popular instructor of humanities, has suc-
ceeded George E. Probst as executive secretary of the UC radio office.

Probst, director since 1944, resigned to become general manager
of WBGH, Lowell institute radio station in Boston, Massachusetts.

University Theater will sponsor a reading by Ken Nordine at
Mandel Hall Saturday, October 9. Nordine is well known to Chicago
televiewers for his readings of horror stories and poetry over
WMAQ-TV.

1st Query: 'When's Prom?'

An eager orientation assistant rushed to greet an entering
student to help carry her luggage to her room in Green Hall.

Former college dean F. Champion Ward has been appointed to a
William Rainey Harper distinguished service professorship. Ward,
who resigned as dean last winter, is currently in Pakistan working
for the Ford foundation. He will return to UC as a professor of phil-
osophy in 1955.

Freedom Our Tradition

Service Our Motto

Each year it is traditional for the Maroon to add its welcome
to the hundreds already received by the entering students. In
our welcome to you, the entering students, forgive if we talk
more about ourselves than you.

We do not yet know you, except for a list of names of new
Students and occasional glimpses at orientation activities.

With this, the first issue of the Maroon for the 1954-55 aca-
demic year, we are introducing ourselves to you and you to
the University.

The University of Chicago, now your University for four,
or perhaps more years, has one tradition that we feel stands
above all others. This is freedom of inquiry in all intellectual
pursuits in both academic and extra-curricular areas.

It is this tradition far more than two year college programs,
that has caused wide misunderstanding of your University.
We believe that it this however tradition that has made Chi-
cago one of the foremost centers of education in the world.

In the spirit of this tradition the College program of the
University has undergone continual evolution. In the spirit of
this tradition students and faculty members feel free to ex-
press their views on all subjects. In short, we believe that it is
this tradition that has attracted so many great scholars of the
world to the University of Chicago.

The Maroon is proud to share the role of maintaining this
tradition.

The Maroon as the only newspaper at the University has a
Special role in this tradition — to serve the interests of the
UC student community.

In the past the Maroon has spoken for specific needs of
Students such as lowering educational costs. Maroon stories
resulted in the lowering of prices of college syllabi which are
published by the University Press. We have not yet succeeded
in lowering tuition rates.

The Maroon has stood for equal rights for all students and
Will not accept any advertising which discriminates against
any student on a religious or racial basis.

The Maroon believes that the widest possible coverage of
Utudent activities is a basic obligation to the student body.
With this in mind, the Maroon publishes with this issue its
first twenty-page paper in more than three years — an issue
Which tries to outline the student role in University affairs.

This is your newspaper as much as ours. Membership on the
Maroon staff is open to any University student — the only
requirement being interest.

Opinions expressed in the editorials of the Maroon are the
Opinions of the majority of the members of the Maroon staff.
All major policy decisions undertaken in the name of the
Maroon again represent the majority view of staff members.
The editor is elected by all staff members, not a small editorial
board.

There is no board of publications, so familiar at other uni-
versities, standing over the Maroon. You, all the students of
the University, are the only board of publications we know or
recognize. The letters-to-the-editor column is open to any stu-
dent — or other member of the University community. Letters
are encouraged from students who have a particular problem
er viewpoint which they would like to express to the Uni ver-
ity community.

This, in brief, is how we believe the Maroon strives to be a
part of the most important of University tradtions.

Honored

Legend
Debunked

High over the first landing of
Ida Noyes Hall hangs the portrait
of the pretty young lady who
served as a namesake for UC’s
women’s club. One hesitates to say
how many times groups of enu-r-
ing students have stood on that
landing and heard from their stu-
dent guides the tragic story of Ida
Noyes.

Ida Noyes, the story runs, was
a br ight and beautiful young lady
("just look at the picture * who
went to a college where member-
ship in sororities was important
(a sharp intake of breath). For
some reason Miss Noyes was not
accepted by the sororities • a
knowing glance). She was very
depressed by her rejection, so de-
pressed in fact that she committed
suicide. ( Oh the waste.”)

LaVerne Noyes, the young
lady’s uncle, was so incense*! by
these events that he endowed the
University of Chicago with a good
deal of money, Including funds for
the building of Ida Noyes Hall, on
the condition that no sorority
would be permitted on the campus
of the University for fifty years.
For this reason, the narrative con-
cluded, there are no sororities at
the University of Chicago.

The tour would then pass on,
leaving in the minds of entering
students a new example of sor-
ority snobbery and a picture of
righteousness triumphant on the
campus of the University of Chi-
cago.

So it was that in 1950 the MA-
ROON printed a story quoting
officials of the Tnter-Club council
as not planning to affiliate with
national sororities; although, the
fifty year ban had ended,

It is a beautiful story full of
moral teachings. There is only one
difficulty. It isn’t true. Ida Noyes
did not dip in sorrow over her re-
jection by a sorority. Uncle La-
Verne left the building as a me-
morial not as an instrument of
extortion and there has never
been a ban on sororities.

UC Supports Three Publications

Review Seeks Student Works Y™£Sd Frisky

Van Allen Bradley, literary editor for the Chicago Daily News, recently described the Young and frisky might be the
Chicago Review as a “scholarly review published at the University of Chicago.” Bradley erred words to describe Cap and Gown,
in two respects. The magazine, according to F. N. Karmatz, editor-in-chief, is hardly “schol- uc’s yearbo°k. it’s post war his-
arly,” pripting between its Covel’s poetry, fiction, articles, reviews, and other materials of
fairly general interest. He also did not apparently know that the Review is put out by stu-
dents as an extra-curricular activity.

In the two years since its re-

viva!, the Review has become
an activity carrying with it a
good deal of “prestige.” The mag-
azine has rated praise from Chan-
cellor Kimpton and favorable re-
views throughout the country. Its
circulation has risen steadily to
its present 6,000, making it one of
the top “little magazines” in the
country.

The policy of the magazine was
to print nnly student work. While
this rule has relaxed, the ratio of

Chess Club Seeks
Girl Chess-Mates

“If any female desires to join
she will be welcome by all,” Rob-

ert M. Shapiro, president of the
UC Chess club said. “In the past
all the members have been male.
There is only one requirement for

membership, an Interest in the
game of chess.” The Chess club
has about 20 active members with
an average age of 18, Shapiro add-
ed.

Several tournaments are con-
ducted each year by the club, both
“rapid transit” (ten second) and
regular. In addition, the club is
the source of players for the Uni-
versity team which represents the
school in matches throughout the
year.

For those who are Interested in
improving their chess game, com-
petent instruction will be offered,
Shapiro promised. Members play
as often as every day or a little
as one night a week, meeting in
one of the Burton-Judson libra-
ries. The club has a rapid transit
clock for fis e and ten second play,
two tournament chess clocks, and
a few chess sets.

Student Government Functions, History Told

Student Government is the only democratically elected, all-campus student organization at the University of Chicago. From its in-
ception in 1947, Student Government has served as a medium for the expression of campus opinion to the Administration, and has
developed an ever-increasing program of student services.

In 1950 the student body and the Administration turned over to SG the responsibil ity of recognizing student organizations and

of enacting the regula-
tions of the Student Code.

SG provides direct
money-saving services and
conveniences for the student
body, including the Student Serv-
ice Center with a book exchange,
tickets, loan and mimeographing
services.

Information Rendered to Students

A few- days ago, entering stu-
dents received copies of the Stu-
dent Handbook, a Student Gov-
ernment publication containing
information about student activi-
ties. the University community,
and other information of interest
to new students.

In a few weeks another. SG pub-
lication, the Student Directory,
listing the names, addresses, and
phone numbers of all registered
students will be available. To-
night in Ida Noyes Hall, Student
Government will cosponsor the
annual Activities Night, where
students may become more fa-
miliar with many student activi-
ties. A similar event, where divi-
sional students may meet faculty
members informally, will be held
for the first time next Monday
night.

SG Offers Tours

As another service to new stu-

student writers remains high and
has been increasing.

F. N. Karmatz

Departmental Organizations

Foster Academic Friendships

The Art club does no painting, and the Business club handles no big business. These clubs
are departmental organizations formed for social and professional meetings of students in
the business school and the art department.

Both of these groups meet on Friday afternoons, but one difference can be noted. The
art students meet for tea, but the business students drink coffee.

Most of the departments and schools in the University have such a club, some of them

emphasizing the social con-
tacts, some of them serving
more academic purposes.

Ann Buckeridge. retiring presi-
dent of the Nursing Education
club, says, “This organization at-
tempts to provide a social-profes-
sional opportunity for its members
through periodic meetings which
are designed to provide profes-
sional as well as social communi-
cation,” a statement which might
well fit many of these clubs.

The Social Service Administra-
tion club, according to a spokes-
man of the group, takes stands on
political issues pertaining to so-
cial work. It also has regularly

dents, SG is providing in the next
few days, again for the first time,
special tours of the campus and
city.

Considerable savings in money
can be made through the Student
Government (NS A) Discount
Service, available at many busi-
ness establishments in the neigh-
borhood, and the three buying
services under contract to the
Government.

An outstanding SG project is
the Foreign Exchange program
with Frankfort University. Set
up to promote international un-
derstanding among students of
the two countries, the program
has provided several German and
American students the opportun-
ity of “exchanging places” for a
year.

SG Works for Freedom

SG has always been concerned
with problems of civil liberties
and academic freedom, and has
established standing committees
to deal with each of these areas.
In 1951 and 1953 SG took the ini-
tiative in calling All-Campus Civil
Liberties Committees to work
against the passage by the Illinois
Legislature of bills which threat-
ened fre academic expression.

SG has worked to promote ra-
cial integration in the University

Present policy provides that “a
substantial portion of (the maga-
zine’s) space is reserved for stu-
dent writing.” But the editors also
will not forget that they “are . . .
chiefly concerned with quality.”

Anyone may submit manu-
scripts. Membership on the staff
will not enhance one’s chances to
get into print; it may do quite the
contrary. Manuscripts should be
type written, with the author’s
name on every page, and a self-
addressed, stamped envelope for
return in case of rejection. The
editors would also like an at-
tached sheet from students con-
taining their division, department,
field of duty, and any pertinent
or interesting information about
themselves or their previous pub-
lications

scheduled guest lecturers who are
prominent in the field of social
service, and bridge parties.

Clubs welcome interested students

Not all of these clubs restrict
their membership to students in
the sponsoring department — a
student who has a real interest
in philosophy will be welcomed
into the Antinomies, the philos-
ophy club, although George D.
O’Brian, triumvirate member of
the group warns, “A general fa-
miliarity with the history of phi-
losophical discussion would seem
to be indispensible.”

Similarly, the Business club
membership is open to those in

neighborhood. It has cooperated
with the Southeast Chicago Com-
mission and the Administration to
rehabilitate the University com-
munity.

Through SG, the campus is a
member of the National Student
Asociation (NSA), a group form-
ed in the Reynolds Club in 1947
with over 300 member schools.
Elections are held in the Spring
Quarter for representatives to the
regional and national congresses
of NSA.

Students desiring to serve in
the Student Government and on
National Student Association dele-
gation usually join one of the
campus political groups. At pres-
ent there are two, the Independ-
ent Students League and the Stu-
dent Representative Party.

ISL Is Majority Party

The Independent Students
League (ISL), present majority
party in SG, was formed in 1948
and until 1952 was always the
majority party in the Student
Government. In the autumn of
1952 the Student Representative
party was formed and gained the
majority in SG election. ISL re-
gained its majority in last SG
election.

All campus elections for UC

tory goes back a mere two years
making it the youngest and few-
est traditioned of any other stu-
dent publication.

As a result the yearbook has no

set style or format and moved
from modern format, in its first
issue, to a conservative one last
year.

The yearbook tries to present a
coherent picture of the University
between the covers of one volume.
Last year the volume featured
articles by the deans of the va-
rious divisions, and schools, and
the college, a review of the year,
a special article on football, and
a gossipy humor supplement
called the Phoenix which con-
tained such valuable information
as the recipe for Mrs. Kimpton’s
favorite punch. This is another
year, another editor (Mike Rodg-
ers), and another staff; one can
hardly give promises what the
book will contain this year.

No experience is required of
prospective staff members. Head-
quarters are Reynolds club base-
ment.

fields related to business who are
interested in attending the weekly
coffee hours at which speakers
are heard.

In some of the departments, all
students are members; Marto Bal-
lesteros, president of the Political
Economy club says, “All graduate
students in the department of
economics are members, auto-
matically,” while in the graduate
library school club, membership
is open to all persons registered in
the library school and president
James Tydeman states, “For prac-
tical purposes, this membership is
the entire student body of the
school.”

delegates to the National Student
Association annual Congress are
held each April. Last spring the
SRP and independent students
who were endorsed by SRP re-
ceived the majority of the NSA
posts. The preceeding election for
NSA all brought ISL majorities
to the NSA delegation.

President States ISL Resolution

According to Al Fortier, ISL
President, “the Independent Stu-
dents League is interested in im-
plementing student opinion and
satisfying student needs.” But
“efforts to take stands of princi-
ple without firmly realistic goals
and methods do not produce re-
sults,” according to Bruce Larkin,
ISL vice-president and present
chairman of the National Execu-
tive Committee of NSA. “For fu-
ture,” stated Fortier, “ISL be-
lives that a bold and constructive
program, realistically carried out
by a team of capable people will
augment the stature and signifi-
cance of the Government, there-
by increasing its effectiveness in
serving and representing the stu-
dent body.”

ISL regularly holds caucuses at
Burton-Jurson Court on Sunday
evenings. Miss Joli Lasker, treas-
urer of ISL, stated that “all stu-
dents interested in learning about

Reporters!

The ‘Maroon’

Wants You!

The main avenue by which news
of the University is disseminated
is also the most controversial,
most closely watched, most inde-
pendent, most used and frequent-
ly most cursed organization on the
campus. With a staff of almost 50
people the Chicago Maroon is also
one of the largest.

According to Allen Janger, edi-
tor-in-chief, the only real Maroon
tradition is the freedom from in-
terference and censorship which
has existed from its very incep-
tion. The administration does not
see the paper before it is printed
and distributed.

The Maroon is the most widely
read UC student publication, hav-
ing a weekly circulation of over
8,500. Cynics attribute this to the
fact that copies are distributed
free. The cost of printing the pa-
per is defrayed primarily by ad-
vertising. Although the Maroon
is a weekly at present, many staff
members hope wistfully that the
paper will someday return to daily
publication.

Anyone may join the Maroon
staff and work as a writer, re-
porter, photographer, copy-read-
er, cartoonist, commercial artist,
layout artist, bookkeeper, ad sales-
man, and/or financier. Experi-
ence is not a pre-requisite. There
is a three-week apprenticeship
period for new members and cer-
tain minimum work requirements
for continued membership.

Maroon Staffers
Meet

The first regular meeting of
the .MAROON staff will be held
Monday, October 11 at 3:30
p.m. Prospective and former
staff members are invited to
attend.

Next Monday at 4 p.m. there
will be an informal meeting for
all former staff members, who
wish to remain on the
MAROON.

ISL are invited to come to our
caucuses.”

SRP Enriches University Life

Dave Hartley, vice-president of
SRP described its purposes as
“providing a means for liberal
social action on the student level,
especially through participation
as one of the major political part-
ies representing the student body
in campus politics.”

SRP enriches University life,
according to Hartley, by “spon-
soring several important cultural
events each year, for example
Pete Seeger and Paul Robeson
concerts. The group provides the
student body with opportunities
to hear speakers often denied a
platform.

“SRP sponsors numerous cam-
pus-wide discussions of current
problems such as academic free-
dom. Students have the opportuni-
ties to present the political views
that they sincerely and maturely
believe and to work for their
fruition.”

SRP also holds caucuses in
Burton-Jurson, and claims a mem-
bership of 75 students. According
to Hartley, “any student may be-
long.” The only “skill” required
is “a desire and ability to imple-
ment decisions made by a major-
ity of the members.”

Outing Club Answers Call of the Wild, Sponsors
Weekend and Interim Ski, Canoe, Camping Trips

Students who can’t stand to go home over interims, or who just like outings, will find on
campus an organization ready to serve them, the Outing club. The club business is ‘‘to spon-
sor special events, and we think they are very special—two and three week vacation trips to
some of the most beautiful parts of the country for a cost between $60 and $100, ski 1 rips to
the high mountains of Colorado for nine days to two weeks for $100 (including transporta-
tion, meals, and lodging), short week-end canoeing and skiing trips for $12 to $20, week-end

Honor Students

camping trips for $5 or less,” ac-
cording to Dotsie Earle, a former
chairman of the group.

Students who are interested in
mountaineering will find another
group, the UC Mountaineering
club, whose basic aim is to bring
together all of those interested in
climbing and to acquaint them
with the techniques and practice
of safe mountaineering. The
group also wishes to introduce
more students to the sport of
climbing, and make available
books, periodicals, and pictures
dealing with the sport, according

to David Solzman,
the club.

The Outing club
includes alumni,

president of

membership
faculty, and



Restricted membership and se-
cret functions characterize Nu Pi
Sigma, Iron Mask, and Owl &
Serpent, the three UC honorary
student organizations.

Nu Pi Sigma is mainly a dis-
cussion group whose members are
invited from the ranks of women
campus leaders only by the unani-
mous vote of active members and
alumnae; like its male counter-
part, Owl & Serpent, Nu Pi Sigma
rarely acts as a group directly but
effects the university community
through the functioning of the
organizations which its members
represent.

Elected each spring on the basis
of outstanding participation in
student activities, the men of Iron
Mask try to co-ordinate student
leadership in the College through
a yearly series of meetings and
social programs.

friends of students, in addition
to students. Members are known
among themselves for the tradi-
tion of the considerable number
of couples who get married after
having first met on an Outing
club trip. “If you ski for a week
together or take a week-long pack
trip with someone in the moun-
tains, you get to know him much
better than many people know
their friends,” Miss Earle said of
the friendships formed.

The idea, for the first big Outing
club trip was dreamed up on
Wash Prom night in 1948, accord-
ing to Miss Earle. The trip took
place over the spring interim that
year—to Florida for nine days
with 63 people at a cost of about
$45 for all expenses. Trips since
then have been as far away as
Jasper National Park in Canada
and as near as Stagg Field.

Housing Councils Cope With Day-To-Day

Problems of Pre-Fab, Dormitory Living

Problems arise throughout the
year in the University housing
facilities, and resident organiza-
tions have been formed to deal
with these problems. The C-group
women’s dorms and the Burton-
Judson men’s residences have
formed larger councils represent-
ing the entire group of houses,
while such houses as Beecher and
such housing groups as the pre-
fabs have their own councils.

Earl Elliott, president of the
Prefab council, notes that his
group “Seeks to coordinate infor-
mation on crime, community

health, building repairs, and the
overall community-wide housing
prospects.”

The B-J and Inter - dormitory
groups sponsor social events in
addition to serving as gripe cen-
ters for the residents and the hous-
ing officials.

Activities of Beecher house in-
clude weekly gatherings with
practicing members of the legal
profession and parties throughout
the year. All members of the law
school who live in Beecher, the
men’s dorm of that school, are
members of the house and “the
house meets infrequently at irreg-

ular intervals, as the need
meetings arises,” according

for
to

“Mar-o-o-o-o-o-n fight!

Rah! Rah!

Rah! Rah! Rah!

Team! Team! Team!”

Leading this and other cheers at UC basketball games will
be members of the Pep Club, who serve as cheerleaders, pub-
licity organizers and rally leaders for those activities con-
cerned with sports on campus. Members of the club also go to
the games to cheer the teams on, and last year some of them
played in a band organized to perform at games.

The Pep Club had its informal beginning in 1953, the year
the basketball team ended their famous 45-game losing streak
by beating Navy Pier 65-52, following a pep rally in which
several hundred students marched across campus in a shout-
ing, band-led procession.

Graduate UC'ers

Find Relaxation

In Self-Seeking

Diverting the wives of graduate
students from their afternoon
floor - scrubbing, washing, baby
feeding, and home permanents is
the Dames Club, an organization
which creates a community of stu-
dent wives and which gives them
a social comradeship comparable
to the academic ones their hus-
bands have.

An admittedly self satisfying
organization, according to Helene
Nelson, the club’s president, the
Dames Club is designed to bene-
fit its own members rather than
the university as a whole; the
Dames, do, however, plan to spon-
sor some sort of civic enterprise -
during the coming year. In addi-
tion to their monthly meetings the
Dames have sewing, athletic, and
language lessons, bazaars, open-
houses, pot-luck suppers, style
shows, and dinner-dances.

First organized at the Univer-
sity of Chicago in 1900, the Dames
have now spread to universities
all over the country, and there is
now a National Association of Uni-
versity Dames.

past president Marshall Susler.
Officers are elected by the house,
as they are by most of the Uni-
versity houses.

Those elected to serve on the
Prefab council have an oppor-
tunity to express their concerns
and to help aid the group, accord-
ing to Elliot, a statement which
holds for all the councils, An-Shih
Cheng, past president of the Inter-
dorm council, says that a repre-
sentative may benefit from her
associations with other members
of the committee by learning to
work in concerted effort with oth-
ers. “She may become aware of
the problems as seen from the
administration and house heads’
point of view,” Miss Cheng adds.

O-Board Works
To Aid Students
In Adjustment

O-Board functions have by now
become familiar to most entering
students as far as orientation of
new students is concerned. Be-
sides these duties, however, Orien-
tation Board holds discussions on
problems which they consider im-
portant, and works for better un-
derstanding by all students of the
educational philosophy of the Uni-
versity. Discussions open to stu-
dents on vocational and divisional
goals are sometimes held by the
group.

Membership is limited by the
University to 15, but applications
are open to any registered under-
graduate. A six week training
course is given for all applicants,
who are chosen on the basis of in-
terest, ability in mixing, ability to
communicate well, and extent of
ability to understand the under-
graduate program, according to
Carolyn Eggert, past secretary.
Membership in the group will help
to increase these skills, Miss Egg-
ert feels.

Hold Card Class

Students who wish to answer
the inevitable call, "fourth for
bridge!” when it echoes through
the halls and houses of the univer-
sity during the year may sign up
now for a series of six bridge les-
sons.

For six consecutive Tuesday
evenings from 7 until 9 beginning
Oct. 12, Mrs. Josephine Walters
Smith, certified contract teacher,
will explain the arts and intrica-
cies of bridge in Ida Noyes Hall.
The fee is $3.00 for students and
$5.00 for nonstudents connected
with the university.

Listeners charmed by Third Herd at SU's Wash Prom.

Seven Permanent Departments,

Ad-hoc Committees Plan SU
Program for '54-35 Season

“If you hate people the Union is not for you’’ stated Joli Lasker, vice-president of Student
Union, a 200-member student organization which guarantees the University an abundance
of weekly social, cultural, and recreational activities.

Already set for SU’s 1954-55 season are daily request hi-fi concerts at the Reynold’s club,
student-faculty discussions, several C-dances, a student art exhibition, ski trips, bowling and
bridge tournaments, and, of course the annual Washington Promenade.

Divide Work

Under president Dale Levy
and vice-president Joli Lasker
the responsibility for the planning

and carrying out of these activ-
ities is assigned to any of seven
permanent SU departments or to
ad hoc committees established at

various times during the year.

Tells Background

After receiving his MA
from Michigan State Phil-
lips taught public speaking
there in 1951. During his army
career he formed a theater group
at Fort Leonard Wood and pre-
sented Moliere before 5.000
troops: in Korea he worked with
informational and educational
services.

Returning from Korea, Phillips
worked as news editor for WILS,
a Lansing station, and as a direc-
tor in summer stock. He came to
Chicago to form a small profes-
sional theater group and was
finally lured into his UC posi-
tions.

Here Seven Years

University Theater, beginning
its first season under Phillips, is
in its seventh year as a campus
organization although a univer-
sity theater in some fotm has
existed at UC since 189G.

No calendar of productions has
been drawn up as yet for this sea-
son. “It is impossible to plan with-
out a full knowledge of the talent
and facilities we’ll have on hand,”
stated Phillips. “The plays must
be chosen to suit the talent, not
the talent manipulated to suit the
plays.”

Some plays which Phillips
would like to see tried, however,
arc Aristophones’ The Clouds,
Yerma’s new poetic drama The
Barren and The Enchanted by
Jean Giraudou with music by
Francis Poulenc. Also of interest
to Phillips are Bernard Shaw’s

Readings Planned

In addition to one major pro-
duction each quarter UT will also
present frequent play readings.
Productions are presented “in the
round” and w i t h- conventional
staging. •

UT welcomes into its ranks all
students with an interest in thea-
ter — experienced or inexperi-
enced who might serve as per-
formers, artists, writers, techni
cians, or photographers, or who
would just like to learn more
about theater and drama by read-
ing and enjoying plays. Serious
students of the theater can expect
to contribute 15 to 20 hours a
week during a production sched-
ule: those with interest but little
free time are welcome to offer
whatever time they can afford.

Tryouts Given

Open tryouts for members and
non-members are held before
each major production.

UT will hold its first open meet-
ing Friday, Oct. 1, at 7:15 p.m. in
the Reynold’s Club Theater. Phil-
lips will discuss interests in UT
at his office, Reynold’s Club 309,
from 3 to 5 every afternoon.

Tell Meeting

The first open meeting of Stu-
dent Forum will be held Monday,
Oct. 4, at 3:30 p.m. in the Rey-
nold's Club Theater; both former
Forum members and any student

with an interest in learning about
the Forum may attend.

“In a university such as this
where, although the#e is not an
organzied speech department, a
high premium is placed on the
ability to form and discuss intel-
ligent views, the experience par-
ticipants in Student Forum obtain
is particularly valuable,” said
Phillips.

Lessons in verbal communica-
tion will be given by Phillips him-
self to Forum members during
the coming year; this will be the
first time in Forum history that
a professional instructor will
have led these sections.

Topic Given

During the year two man teams
will be sent for debates at several
midwestern colleges; this sea-
son’s national debate topic is “Re-
solved: that the United States
should grant diplomatic recogni-
tion to Red China.” Debaters are

prepared for these contests by
extensive individual research and
by suggestions of other Forum
members.

Forum members are sehedued
to visit Michigan State, Wiscon-

sin. Purdue, Michigan, Illinois,
and D e P a u w universities and
most Chicago schools. Debaters
from Oxford, New York Univer-
sity, and India will visit UC un-
dpr Forum sponsorship.

The Forum discussion groups
will also hold a series of discus-

sion programs before women’s
clubs, PTA groups, and student
bodes of Chicago schools. Plans
for radio and television work for
Forum members are also being
considered.

Washington Promenade (popular-
ly known as the Wash Prom), the
biggest all-campus dance of UC’s
social season, according to Miss
Lasker.

Training in silk-screen, mimeo-
graphing, dittographing, and
photo-offset makeup techniques is
offered in the SU’s publicity work-
shop to anyone interested in work-
ing for the publicity department.

Produce Publicity

This department provides post-
ers and other advertising media
as per instructions of other SU
departments, and members work-
ing with design, printing, and
processing are expected to do no
more than produce vast quantities
of painted and written material at
a moment’s notice.

Working at a similarly hectic
rate is the staff of the SU Fore-
cast, a 4 page information sheet
which previews and reviews SU-
sponsored and other-sponsored so-
cial. cultural, and recreational *
events.

Jobs Open

Forecast currently has many
openings for both experienced and
inexperienced students as report-
ers, ad sellers, artists, copy and
rewriters, and make-up men.

Swimming pool, gym. bowling
alley, card rooms, table tennis,
television, lounges, and meeting
rooms are among the recreational
facilities available at Ida Noyes
Hall; it is the job of the SU Ida
Noyes council to see that these
facilities remain available to as
great a number of students as
possible.

The council also sponsors bridge
and bowling tournaments and
other SU Ida Noyes special events.

Nationality Clubs
Admit Everyone,
Stress Cultures

Among'the UC student organ-
izations, there are a few intended
primarily for students of certain
national backgrounds, such as the
Japanese Students association and
the University of Chicago Polish
club. Membership in both of these
groups is open to anyone interest-
ed in joining, however.

Raymond Sanders, vice-presi-
dent of the Polish club, says of the
organization, “The club brings be-
fore the eye of the campus the
events in the city that portray part
of the Polish culture and ideas
that have developed from Amer-
icanization. It tries to round out
the campus calendar with a vari-
ety that satisifies the current
need.”

Activities include cultural and
social affairs and raising money
for scholarships “for the cause of
advancing the education of the
Polish people in America,” accord-
ing to Sanders.

The Japanese Student associa-
tion “promotes the mutual friend-
ship and assistances arRong Jap-
anese students on campus,” ac-
cording to the 1953-1954 secretary
of the group, Tadao Fujii. Activ-
ities include orientation for the
newcomers, informal parties, oc-
casional lectures or meetings “for
the visiting VIPs from Japan,’’ ac-
cording to Fujii.

Student Services Offer

T^ Tests to Theater Tickets

It has been said that a university is more than an institution of learning. In that spirit,
the University of Chicago offers its student body many and varied services with which it
can solve most of its problems.

Some of these are well known and patronized accordingly. Others are not familiar to the
average student but are of equal value. The student may find it to his advantage to investi-

gate all of them.

Harper library forms the
nucleus of a widely scattered
library system. Many of the
departments of the library are
especially located to be conveni-
ent for students in special fields.
The library is generally open from
9 a m. to 6 p.m. with some of the
sections also open during the eve-
nings. Further information about
the library is available in a 33
page booklet which can be ob-
tained at the libraries.

Offer Jobs

Students wanting jobs will find
the employment office at 956 E.
58th St. Patricia Metcalf is
the director of the office, which is
open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wives
of students can also get jobs
through the employment office,
although they are limited to jobs
on the campus.

Those people who first want to
determine what they are best suit-
ed for before looking for a job
should go to the Vocational Guid-
ance center in room 305 of the
Administration building.

Vocational guidance is open
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and is
under the supervision of Robert
C. Woellner. It is available to both
students and nonstudents. How-
ever, students are given a special
rate.

U C Tradition

Shunning Tradition

by Mitchell Slein

There is scarcely an educational institution that does not
have its own share of tradition. However, the University of
Chicago (never say U. of C.) has made a tradition of having
none. At first, this statement may sound a little like double
talk, but it is not.

Once, in the dim dark past, UC had many and varied and
hallowed traditions. Then ...——,17..^

ates an information center on the
first floor of the Administration
Building. Here are catalogues,
calendars, maps, and all official
notices. University Information
operates a lost and found, which

is the
all lost
course
mation

eventual resting place of
articles on campus, and a
file, which contains infor-
on all courses, including

schedule corrections.

Addresses of students and fac-
ulty are available, as are answers
to various questions. If the infor-
mation desk doesn’t know, they
will direct you to someone who
will, when possible.

Every student entering the uni-
versity must take a physical ex-
amination. This takes place at the
Student Health Service located in
Billings Hospital, where students
who are ill are treated also. It is
open from 8:45 to 11:30 in the
mornings, and 1:15 to 4:30 in the
afternoons. Mondays through Fri-

days,
from
often
with
ority.

On Saturday the hours are
8:45 to 11:30 a.m. There is
a long wait, although those

flu are given pri-

colds or

SG

The Student

Serves

Services Center is

located in the basement of the
Reynolds club. It is a catchall for
all services operated by the Stu-
dent Government (SG). Among
its many services are the dispens-

ing of N.S.A. discount lists and
cards and student loans that are
given to students upon presenta-
tion of validated I D. cards.

The loans are for up to $10 for
two weeks and are at a flat ten
cent fee with a fine of 25 cents
per week or fraction thereof for
non-payment.

A ticket service that charges 15
cents for off-campus tickets and
has no charge for tickets to cam-
pus events, is also located at the
Student Services Center. The tick-
et agency has telephone arrange-
ments with the opera house and
orchestra hall.

The most widely used service of
the Student Service Center is the
book exchange. Students set their
own prices, which are automati-
cally lowered at set intervals if
the book does not sell at the orig-
inal rate. After 18 months, an un-
sold book becomes the property of
the center unless withdrawn by
the owner. The center collects a
fee of ten per cent. A nonprofit
mimeograph service is also run
by the center.

List Hours

The student service center will
be open from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m., and 3:30 to 5:30 p.m., during
the first and last two weeks of
the quarter. During the remainder
of the quarter, it will be open
from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and
3:30 to 4:30 p.m.

For special occasions Yellow
cabs can be called from univer-
sity phones. Western Union has an
office on the first floor of the ad-
ministration building. The office
is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The United States government
operates two postal substations
in the university area. One is in
the University Bookstore and the
other is a Woodworths Book-
store. The hours at the first are
from 8 to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday
and to noon Saturday. The substa-
tion at Woodworths is open from

There is also a shoeshine service.

The barber shop is air conditioned

these old Gothic walls. Stu-
dents who scoffed at the idea that
only honored personages could sit
on the "C” bench in front of Cobb
Hall en.tered the school. A tradi-
tion fell. Only those who are nos-
talgic for the past remember that
at one time the bench was for
seniors, campus beauties, etc.

Destroy Traditions

Thus the University developed
a tradition of doing away with all
the old traditions. The cry went
up that Chicago was non tradi-
tional and non-traditionalism it-
self became the most honored and
cherished of the University of
Chicago traditions.

One of the most amazing things
about the ivy covered walls within
which the faculty strives to turn
out thinking men and women, is
the way that the memory of.the
superstitions have remained even
though the practices have long
been forsaken.

nto their favorite haunt.

Bridge Not Used

It has been said that the bridge
over botany pond is the only
place where a girl may be pro-
posed to. In the tradition of non-
traditionalism, this is the only
place on campus that is never
used for this purpose.

Female students at the Univer-
sity of Chicago are never, but
never, referred to as co-eds. The
origin of this unique institution
is vague and obscured. They are
supposed to be referred to as
"university women.” However, al-
though it is not sure whether or
not this is a tradition, it too is
overlooked.

Most of the male students find
it more convenient to refer to
girls in their own particular ver-
nacular. This may result from
their being taught that self ex-
pression is by far the best and
most direct.

No “Frats**

Fraternity men resent their or-
ganizations being called "frats.”
They never do, and constantly try
to discourage others from doing
so.

Nontraditionalism demands,
however, that a few of the dis-
respectful, who first look behind
them to see that a “frat man” is
not in hearing distance, will refer
to “the frats.”

Traditions Left

Those surviving traditions that

Botany Pond . . .
. . . with two students who may
or may not be proposing.

recall the “good old days” are
sometimes confusing to the new-
comer. Often the new student is
startled by the Mitchell Tower
(the tower over Hutchinson Com-
mons) ringing at precisely 10:31
p.m. every night.

This originally was a "lights
out” signal for athletes during the
height of UC’s great sports era
under Stagg. It now rings with
the sole purpose of making good
copy for an article such as this.

No One Dies For Zeta

Fraternities at UC are different, but not too different, according to George Stone, Inter-
fraternity council president. Hazing died too long ago to rank as even a sad memory and
nobody dies anymore for dear old Zeta chapter—no one even offers. “But,” Stone said, “we
have a great deal of fraternity spirit; although, anybody who comes to UC expecting to find
a fraternity where the chapter comes first and University responsibility second will be sadly
disappointed.” Fraternity life on a campus inevitably reflects the institution, and at the Uni-
versity of Chicago that means -------------------------------------------------»-------------------

a deep interest in academic as
well as other activities.

UC chapters have, therefore,
perennially Jed the nation with
their academic averages without
a conscious effort on their part.

But, as on most campuses, UC’s
fraternities are the campus seat
of traditionalism and the social
outlook.

Fraternity members Stone said,
are “more tradition oriented.” No-
where on campus are memories of
Botany Pond battles more fervent-
ly nursed, fondly recalled, or more
enjoyably relived.

Fraternity social functions, with
some exceptions, are mostly par-
ties, smokers, and such like; they
are also active in community work
projects.

Stereotypes Twisted

UC does, of course, have the tra-

ditional fraternity stereotypes, the
“rah! rah!” (or “rippety-tear,” but
that’s a different story) fraterni-
ty, the athletic fraternity, et al.
At UC, however, even the stereo-
types have a twist: the fraternity
with the highest percentage of
varsity athletes holds the campus
scholarship trophy.

UC chapters, according to Stone,
tend to rebel at campus intellectu-
alism. The “intellectualism” they
ridicule, however, is not that of
intelligence and a serious interest
in study. They tend to oppose,
rather, the almost undefinable
type of “intellectualism” preva-
lent at UC during the last decade.

If proponents of this latter type
of “intellectualism” can be regard-
ed as having an abhorrence at
even a mention of the word “foot-
ball” it is interesting to note that
it was on the lawn fraternity
houses that there appeared last
fall displays endorsing the ru-
mored return of football to cam-
pus.

Fraternity social activities are
usually frequent, well-planned,
and successful — certainly more
so than those offered in univer-
sity housing.

Costs the Same

Some say that fraternity hous-
ing and membership saves money;
others say it doesn’t. In any event,
a spendthrift is a spendthrift no
matter where he lives. Initiation

Women's Clubs Sponsor

Social Welfare Activities

Women’s clubs of the University of Chicago have been ac-
tive in presenting a varied program for their members and
the University community since the first club was formed
sixty years ago. At present there are four women’s clubs on
campus: Sigma, Delta Sigma, Quadranglers, and Mortarboard.

The program of the women
is closely correlated with wel-
fare activities. Some of the
organizations which are aided
by the clubs are the Red Cross,

Christmas Settlement Party,
a part of fraternity and wom-
en’s club welfare work.

’s clubs is not only social, but

the World University Service, Bil-

ment house.

At Christmas, the clubs join
with the fraternities to give part-
ies for orphans and underprivi-
leged children. The latest project
of the women's club is reading to
blind students on campus. Besides
these welfare activities, some
clubs maintain scholarship funds.

Highlighting the women's clubs
social activities are two formal
dances, Preferential Dinner and
Interclub Ball. The former is held
at the end of fall rushing, the
latter in January. Besides the two
formal dances, there are individ-
ual club parties and coffee hours
with the fraternities throughout
the year.

The Interclub Council, com-
posed of the presidents and two
representatives from each of the
women’s clubs, serves as the or-
ganizing and governing body of
the women's clubs of the Univer-
sity of Chicago, collectively.

To Rush

Interclub Tea, which is open to
all women students sixteen years
or older will be held Wednesday
afternoon, October 13, in the Ida
Noyes library. According to Ruth
Kopel, Interclub Council presi-
dent, the tea serves as introduc-
tion of the women of the Univer-
sity to the club system and prepa-
ration for the rushing period
which begins at 6 p.m., Sunday,
October 17. During the two-week
rushing period, each club will
have two evening parties and one
afternoon party, which are open
to all eligible women. The rush-
ing period will be climaxed by
Preferential Dinner and Dance,
Saturday night, October 30.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Varied Theatrical, Musical, Other Artistic Fare
Offered .UC Students by Metropoliton Chicago

At this time of year, Chicago’s cultural minded turn their attention from summer thea-
ters, outdoor concerts, and sidewalk art exhibits to more conventional, and certainly more
comfortable showcases of theatrical, musical, and other artistic fare. In addition to campus
presentations, the university’s position in Chicago makes other cultural opportunities easily
accessible.

The 64th season of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra opens in mid-October, the series of

28 Thursday evening and 28
Friday afternoon concerts be-
ginning in the week of Oct. 14
and the series of 12 Tuesday after-
noon concerts beginning Oct. 26.
Particularly good for students are
the Friday afternoon concerts at
which 65 cents will buy a seat in
the gallery, from which the music
can best be heard.

Under Fritz Reiner, a relative
newcomer to the Chicago scene,
the orchestra’s reputation, which
has tottered frequently during the
last generation, has been consid-
erbly strengthened. Critics have
been particularly enthusiastic
over the orchestra’s performance
of works by Richard Strauss
(Reiner’s pet composer), Mous-
sorgsky’s “Pictures at an Exhibi-
tion,” and Beethoven’s even-num-
bered symphonies. Compositions
of special interest which the or-
chestra will perform during the
coming season are some of the
little-known later works of Rich-
ar 1 Straus and a concerto grosso
with a new twist. Rolf Lieber-
mann’s “Concerto for Jazz Band
and Orchestra.”

Give Soloists

In addition to Reiner, the or-
chestra will have as guest con-
ductors Joseph Krips and Bruno
Walter. A few of the soloists
scheduled are Robert Casadesus
(pianist), Zino Francescatti (vio-
linist). Walter Gieseking (pian-
ist). Andres Segovia (guitarist),
and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (so-
prano >.

On Sunday afternoons the Al-
lied Arts series of twelve concerts
will feature, among others,
Marion Anderson, Zino Frances-
catti. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the
Vienna Boys’ Choir, and Jascha
Heifitz. A savings of 50 per cent

Announcements of other con-
certs at several other auditori-
ums are posted in the Reynold’s
club for what seems to be about
15 of 16 years in advance. Tickets
for Chicagoland musical and thea-
trical events can be purchased
conveniently at the Student Serv-
ice Center, Reynold's club base-
ment.

Opening the 1954-55 theater sea-

Jean Arthur. Nov. 8; Tea and
Sympathy with Deborah Kerr.
March 7; and The King and I with
Yul Brynner and Patricia Morri-
son, date not set.

Under new tax legislation prices
at many theaters have been re-
duced considerably. Those for
Picnic start at $1.10, only 25 cents
more than many double feature
movies. Few plays give Sunday
night performances, and prices
for some plays skyrocket on Sat-
urday nights.

Produce Drama

Goodman Memorial Theatre, at
the foot of East Adams street on
Columbus drive, presents plays
produced by th^rd, fourth and
fifth year students in the Art In-
stitute School of Drama for the
public and members of the Art
Institute. This season marks the
2-1 th year of membership plays.

The season of eight plays runs
from October through May. The
opening play will be a good com-
mercial bit, Yes, My Darling
Daughter, followed by Thunder
Rock; in the planning stage are
The Cocktail Party and Victoria
Regina. The theater always pre-
sents one Shakespearean work
during the year. Prices are $1.10
for regular admission, 75 cents
for members of the Art Institute,
and 50 cents for students.

Playwright’s Theater Ciub, 1205
North Dearborn, provides an ex-
cellent proving ground for ambi-
tious young Chicagoans inter-
ested in getting practical experi-
ence in theater work. Called
“club” for reasons of zoning and
taxation, this group experimented
during the summer with a Shake-
spearean festival, some plays of
which were highly acclaimed by
Chicago critics, who rarely ac-
claim anything.

Air New York

The group is particularly inter-
ested in airing significant new
plays and translations of out-
standing European works. Prices
for performances are $3, $2. and
$1.50. Following their current pro-
duction of Ibsen’s Peer Gynt on

the theater’s newly remodeled
stage will be Chekov’s The Sea
Gull, Oct. 12-31; Oscar Wilde’s
Salome, Nov. 2-14; Theodore Horr-
man’s Rich But Happy, Nov. 16-
Dec. 5; and A Time for Laughter,
based on three pieces of Jewish
literature, starting on Dec 7.

The following Chicagoland thea-
ters show films which are nebu-
lously dubbed “prestige" films:
Hyde Park, Harper, Surf (par-
ticularly good for English films),
Carnegia (ditto), Cinema Annex,
attractive to those who like films
dealing with good music. Russian
films, and controversial films).
Loop, Ziegfield. and World Play-
house (showing the worst and
best of foreign films t. The Harper
and Hyde Park are near campus,
offer double features, and give
discounts to students.

The best way to keep posted on
art and museum exhibits is
through the daily newspaper or
through announcements in the
Chicago Exhibitions Calendar.
Particularly good are the lecture
and art exhibit announcements
and reviews buried among the
women’s pages of the Chicago
Tribune.

The Chicago Exhibition Calen-
dar. a quarterly publication list-
ing all exhibits of art and science,

ual subscriptions are $1 for eight
issues covering a two-year period,
and may be obtained by writing
to the Chicago Exhibitions com-
mittee, the Art Institute of Chi-
cago. Adams street and Michigan
avenue.

The Art Institute of Chicago,
widely denounced as the museum
with the dirtiest exterior in the
country, houses the finest art col-
lection in the Midwest.

Among its collections are 50,000
original prints and drawings,
paintings and watercolors, rang-
ing from the earliest religious
subjects in 13th century Europe
to Picasso, Klee, and Leger, the
greatest collection of 19th and
20th century French paintings,
sculpture, bronzes, and fabrics
from China, Persia, Egypt, and
India; period rooms of Eliza-
bethan England and Puritan
America; and Graeco-Roman, Me-
dieval, Renaissance, Baroque, and
Modern sculpture.

In the Art Institute libraries
are 52,000 volumes on art and
9,200 volumes dealing with the
history of architecture.

Change Exhibits

Other far smaller galleries at

which exhibits are frequently
changed are Marshall Field and
Co.; the Cinema Theatre. Chi-
cago avenue and Michigan boule-
vard: the Chicago Society of Art-
tists, 613 North State; La Fou-
tique Fantasque, 103 East Oak;
and the Allan Frumkin Gallery,

Excellent art exhibits may also
be seen in Goodspeed hall on the
UC campus, where the Renais-
sance Society displays many large
touring exhibits of paintings,
sculptures, mobiles, and framing
techniques.

For those without the price of
a theater or concert ticket, any of
Chicago’s museums can provide
a diverting and inexpensive after-
noon (although for some one must
go on the right afternoons). The
Adler Planetarium. Rosevelt road
and Lake Michigan, displays an-
tique and modern astronomical in-
struments and photographs of
the heavens. Lectures and demon-
strations under a man-made “sky”
are given twice daily.

Show Science

Clustered near the planetarium
is the Shedd Aquarium which
contains 10,000 live fish and other
aquatic specimens, and The Chi-
cago Natural History Museum,
which is devoted to anthropology,
botany, geology, and zoology. Of
special interest in the Natural
History Museum are the “Races
of Mankind” series of life-size
bronzes by Malvina Hoffman; the
Hall of the Stone Age with dio-
ramas of prehistoric man; and
the series of mammals and birds
in reproductions of their natural
habitats.

Pretty faces from all over the
world appear on the Chicago cul-
tural scene during the year. Uday
Shankar and his Indian ballet usu-
ally put in an Opera House ap-
pearance annually, as well as Anna
Maria and her Spanish ballet.
Native music from the Orient and
Occident can be heard in many of
Chicago's night clubs and large
and small concert halls.

Theatrical and Music Societies

Come Into Full-Blossom at UC

The principle that a single det or does not make a produc-
tion nor a solo voice an oratorio has led to the blossoming of
numerous student organizations devoted to theatrical and
musical self-expression.

The reward members of such organizations obtain is found

not so much in the hectic pace
actual concerts and perform-
ances as in the experience and
work-discipline of pre-per-
formance preparation.

The Bach Singers, an admitted-
ly high-brow organization devoted
to the systematic cultivation of
the Bach choralbueh and other
genres of choral music, train
members to improve sight-read-
ing, carry a voice part, read me-
dieval Gregorian - German nota-
tion, and polish their German pro-
nunciation.

Humanities students will find
this work particularly valuable
insofar as the selections are not
simply sung, but that their lin-
guistic, theological, and cultural
content is also treated.

State Requirements

The Bach singers welcome any
student or non-student who pos-
sesses a fair singing voice, some
familiarity with note-reading and
a love of work. To insure continu-
ity of the group's development,
College students are particularly
encouraged to join.

Rehearsals are held each Satur-
day from 1:30 to 4:30 with a re-
cess of 20 minutes for coffee; a
minimum of individual work at
home is also required.

“Singing for the enjoyment of
it” is the refreshingly unpreten-
tious goal of the University Glee
club, according to Peter Gram
Swing, the group’s conductor.
This confraternity of singers
gives students an opportunity to
perform choral works of high
musical value.

The aim of the group is a high
degree of technical proficiency in
performance, without requiring
members to possess the qualifica-
tions of professional choristers.
The group also has an active so-
cial life, holding suppers, spon-
taneous get-togethers, and after-
concert parties. The club puts on
several concerts a year, both on
and off campus.

There arc no initial auditions in
the Glee Club, and members may
be expected to put in about three
hours a week in preparation for
concerts.

Play Chamber Music

The Collegiate Sinfonietta gives
occasional concerts with the Glee
Club, which practices the Sinfoni-
etta and performs chamber mu-
sic, also gives concerts with solo-
ists during the year. The size of
the Sinfonietta ranges from 12

and professional excitement of

to 22 members according to the
number of instrumentalists .re-
quired for specific works. Admis-
sion to the Sinfonietta is by audi-
tion with the conductor, Dieter
Kober.

Another opportunity for stu-
dents to play good music with a
select group of fellow instrumen-
talists or soloists is provided by
the Collegium Musicum. This is a
chamber orchestra of between
twenty-five to thirty players. Re-
hearsals are held in Mandel Hall
from 7:30 to 10 every Monday
evening. The Collegium will loan
instruments to members who do
not have theirs on campus.

Champion Folk Songs

The cause of the folk-song, "the
permissable form of lunacy for
the intellectual fringe,” is cham-
pioned by the UC Folklore So-
ciety. The Society gives members
a chance to learn folk-songs and
to meet others interested in folk-
music and folk-dancing.

The informal “Wing Dings” are
held where members sing folk-
songs and lead group singing,
square and folk-dances. The bulk
of the society’s 110 members
come from the College with ages
ranging from 14 upward.

Of a somewhat similar flavor
are the Country Dancers, a group
which experiments with the Eng-
lish folk-dance.

Acrotheatre is a dancing and
acrobatic group which gives three
full length shows annually and
several shorter-length shows for
the alumni, the lab school and
other organizations. Although
many of Acrotheatre’s people
have had dancing and gymnastic
experience, no special skills are
necessary for a student to join
the group. Skills are developed
in weekly practice sessions and
lessons, this training program
consisting mostly of mass instruc-
tion by professional instructors.

Acrotheatre gives each student
instruction in tumbling, modern
dance, adagio dancing, acrobatics,
and other related skills. Skills in
theater arts, such as make-up, set
design, staging, lighting, and act-
ing may also be acquired. Most
members are expected to put in
four hours a week unless they
have other duties to perform.

Other dance groups on campus
are the Modern Dance Club and
the Knights of the Ballet, a group

A dramatic profile from a pro-
duction presented lost year by
University Theatre. University The-
ofre this year plans to produce
three major works and several play
readings.

which writes, produces, and per-
forms their own ballets.

Offer Theater Training

Providing a varied program of
drama training and experience
is University Theatre. The theater
company produces three major
productions and several drama
readings throughout the year.

UT offers experience to anyone
interested in acting, directing, de-
signing, writing, translating,
painting, lighting, make-up, pho-
tography, or any phase of theater.
Membership in the company is
open to any student on a try-out
basis.

A number of executive posi-
tions are open with WUCB, the
capus radio station. No experi-
ence is necessary or expected of
prospective WUCB members, and
training is offered informally in
the fields of announcing and engi-
neering, and more formally in
producing, publicity, business, and
many other related fields. The
amount of time required of a
member of ay experience is fairly
flexible, although two hours a
week is considered a mininjum.

Cultural Activities Outlined

(from page 12)

ter may also be obtained. Tickets
and information for these and
other concerts may be found at
the music office, 5802 Woodlawn.

Musicuni to Play

Other Mandel hall concerts are
given by the Collegium Musicum,
a chamber orchestra of between
25 and 30 players which during
the past year performed works
of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Rameau,
and Bartok.

The Collegiate Sinfonietta is a
group of from twelve to 22 in-
strumentalists which performs
music for chamber orchestra. The
Sinfonietta gives occasional con-
certs with soloists and concerts
in connection with the UC Glee
Club.

Already in rehearsal is the Oc-
tober 29 concert of the Bach Sing-
ers, an independent choral group
which cultivates Bach Choralbueh

WUCB Plans Given

New high-power transmitters for International House,
larger studio facilities, and a heavier program schedule are
included among the fall expansion plans of WUCB, the cam-
pus radio station.

WUCB will be braodcasting to International House by the
first week of classes in the autumn quarter, providing cover-

age there for the first time in
several years. The transmitter
is expected to deliver a strong,
high-quality signal to all parts of
the large building.

lies Rare Hi-Fi

According to John Lyon, sta-
tion manager, WUCB’s present
transmitters in Burton-Judson and
the C-Group are two of the few
high-fidelity AM transmitters in
the world. The present facilities
include transmitters in various
locations; studios; and various
studio equipment such as micro-
phones, turntables, and tape re-
corders. WUCB’s broadcasting
frequency is 640 on the AM dial.

The station also has tentative
plans for construction of new
studios in BJ early in the autumn
quarter; according to plans the
new studios will be far superior
accoustically to WUCB’s present
studios and in a more convenient
location.

Re-Broadcasts

WUCB’s 14 Ms hours of program-
ming daily, including WEFM re-
broadcasting, bring classical and
semi-classical music to campus
listeners during most of the day
and late evening; the only daily
campus news; the only extensive
Chicago AM program of poetry,
drama, and readings; and many
special features such as on the
spot campus election coverage,
musical scores of Broadway
shows, popular music and jazz.

Among the new programs

from cover to cover, as well as
canons, selected Gregorian
themes, German folksongs of the
16th century, sacred folksongs,
motets, and madrigals. The Octo-
ber 29 concert will include sacred
and secular music of Bach and
some of his contemporaries. An
elaborate Christmas program to
be sung in French is also being
readied.

Tell Attractions

Other Mandel attractions in-
clude lecture series, one-night
stand ballet troupes, non-series
concerts, jazz concerts, perform-
ances by the UC Glee club, and
speakers and soloists sponsored
by various campus organizations.

Countless series and non-series
public lectures are held during
the year. Best known series are
the Vaughn Moody lectures,
which last year presented, among
others, Joyce Carey, Katherine

scheduled for an autumn premier
is The Wax Museum, broadcast-
ing old records, many of them
collectors’ items, from the private
collection of WUCB staffer Bill
Dunning, who produces the pro-
duces the program. Among the
records which listeners will hear
on The Wax Museum, some of
which are almost 30 years old. are
tunes by such musicians as Glenn
Miller, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dor-
sey, Jelly Roll Morton, Duke Ell-
ington, and many others, all well-
known jazz artists.

Series Returns

Returning to the air Sept. 27 is
Vox Parnasse, a program of aural
literature, heard each Monday
evening at 9 p.m. This quarter’s
first program will inaugurate a
four-week series of readings from
the works of English poet-phil-
osopher John Donne, read by pro-
fessor Austin Warren of the Eng-
lish department of the University
of Michigan.

Future Vox broadcasts will in-
clude Ronald Coleman reading the
Bible and other poets reading
their own works. Recordings used
on Vox Parnasse are borrowed
through special arrangement from
the Harriet Monroe Modern Poet-
ry Collection in Harper Library,
where they may be heard on play-
back equipment installed in the
library.

Ann Porter, and Marianne Moore;
and the Charles A. Walgreen lec-
tures, which last year sponsored
Leo Strauss’ three-lecture discus-
sion of Machaivelli and Gordon
Clapps’ discussion of the TVA.

In the Reynold’s Club Theater,
University Theater, now in its
seventh year as a campus organi-
zation, offers a program of play
production and study to members
of the University community.
Productions are presented both
in the round and in the conven-
tional theater arrangement.

UT Premieres

In its seven-year history, UT
has world premiered nearly ten
new plays. One full-scale produc-
tion may be expected each quar-
ter in addition to frequent bare-
stage play readings. Prices for
performances loiter in the vicin-
ity of a dollar.

In addition, the campus offers
a movie series not available in the
commercial theaters. Internation-
al House presents older American
and foreign films weekly, and
Burton Judson’s Friday and Sun-
day night programs include more
recent Hollywood productions and
archaic adventure serials.

documentary film series, which
last year presented, among other
features, a comedy film survey,
the early film, “A Trip to the
Moon,” and Erich von Stroheim’s
“Extase.” Tickets to Doc films
are sold by subscription.

Religious Clubs Serve Campus

Supporting the many churches and synagogues of the University community in their role
as established institutions for the spiritual growth of their student members are the many
religious clubs and organizations found on the campus.

These student religious organizations extend over a wide range of faiths and denomina-
tions. Their general purpose seems universally devoted to promoting an atmosphere of re-
ligious fellowship and spiritual guidance to be integrated with the student’s intellectual and

social endeavors.

The Porter Foundation is a
campus religious organization
which came into existence two
years ago upon the merger of
Presbyterian. Congregational,
Evangelical and Reform groups
on campus.

Several fellowships are spon-
sored to meet the needs of a di-
verse student body. These are:
the College Fellowship, the Grad-
uate Fellowship, and the Couples’
Club.

President Jerry Hogan of the
College Fellowship has announced
that the first meeting of this or-
ganization will be a supper meet-
ing to be held in Swift Hall Com-
mons at 6 p.m. to October 3.

The first meeting of the Gradu-
ate Fellowship will be held Octo-
ber 6 at 7 p.m. at Chapel House.
The Reverend William N. Lovell
is the spiritual advisor for the
fellowship groups.

List Activities

Hillel Foundation sponsors
Jewish religious services every

Friday evening at 7:45 at Ray-
mond Karasik House, 5715 Wood-
lawn. Following services is an
informal social gathering at the
house called Fireside, which many
times sponsors a featured speak-
er. Besides religious service, Hil-
lel’s activities include lessons and
discussions on Jewish language,
history and folk dancing.

Gunther Heilbrunn, president
of the Hillel Student Council has
announced this quarter's first Fri-
day night lecture and discussion
will deal with the subject of “Sym-
bolic Religion.”

Tell Aims

Calvert Club, the Roman Catho-
lic student club, meets at DeSales
House, 5735 University, and seeks
to “deepen the spiritual and en-
rich the temporal lives of the
group through a program of re-
ligious, intellectual and social ac-
tivities.” Besides the availability
of the chapel, library and recrea-
tion rooms of DeSales House,
plans have been made for a full
program of lectures, parties, re-

treats and discussions to enrich
the campus life of Roman Catho-
lic students. .

Channing Club is the student
organization for those students
of . a Universalist persuasion.
Meetings are held on Sunday eve-
nings from 6 to 10 p.m. at the
William W. Fenn House, 5633
Woodlawn, and include a dinner
followed by discussions and rec-
reation.

Plans for a weekend retreat at
Druce Lake Camp in northern
Illinois have been set for October
22 to 24. Unitarian services are
held at the First Unitarian
Church, 57th and Woodlawn.

Give Purposes

The Inter-Varsity Christian Fei-
lowship, in the words of last
year’s president, Nancy Turner,
“seeks to encourage the student
to have a very real and meaning-
ful relationship to Christ.” This
organization began at Cambridge
and Oxford in the latter part of
the 19th century and since then

meetings are usually held in Jud-
son Lounge.

Reception Planned

Episcopalians on campus will
find fellowship in the Episcopal
Church Council and the Canter-
bury Club. The council is an or-
ganization designed for faculty,
and Canterbury Chib is the na-
tional organization for Episcopal
college students.

Anderson, University Marshal,
Directs Convocation Activities

Convocation time is still a long way off for most new entrants, but Harold A. Anderson,
University marshal, already knows what the ceremony will be like. Anderson serves as the
Chancellor’s aide, making the arrangements for all official University functions, such as the
Chancellor’s Reception, and the four convocations at which degrees are conferred each year.

In addition, he manages the receiving line at such functions as the trustees’ dinner for the
faculty, and performs such special duties as arranging and administrating the procession of

282 dignitaries for the recent
Bar Center dedication.

Tells Alm

“The convocation should be
dignified and yet simple. Every-
thing should proceed with preci-
sion without ostentatiousness.
There should be a pause after the
reading of each candidate’s name
W’hile he stands facing the audi-
ence to receive his degree,” An-
derson believes.

Fur this reason he inaugurated
the present convocation scheme
after his appointment by the
Chancellor ten years ago. “We are
one of the few Universities that
make an attempt to call the names
of the graduates and have them
appear to receive actual diplo-
mas." he explains. “Sometimes I
don’t know whether it is worth
the effort, but 1 think the students
appreciate this.”

The students are lined up in the
chapel basement before the con-
vocation according to Anderson’s
plan, which he must construct for
each set of graduates. Twelve as-
sistant faculty marshals and 20

Canterbury Club meetings are
held on Tuesday night between
8 and 10 p.m. at Ida Noyes Hall.
The first meeting of the fall term
will be a very special occasion
for Episcopal students. At this
initial meeting on October 5, stu-
dents and faculty combined are
invited to a reception in honor
of the Rt. Rev. Gerald F. Burrill,
the Episcopal Bishop of Chicago.
Cannon Bernard hidings Bell is
the priest and spiritual advisor to
campus Episcopalians.

Move Services

Communion services of the
Episcopal Church will be returned
to the newly renovated Bond
Chapel beginning Octotar 3, at
8:30 a.m.

The Charles Gilkey Foundation
is a Baptist-sponsored program of
religious ministry to students of
the Baptist Church. The activities
of the Foundation are centered at
the Hyde Park Baptist Church
which in turn sponsors the Bap
list Student Fellowship. Friday
evenings from 7:30 to 10 p.m are
open house nights at the church
for student Baptists.

Christian Science services are
conducted weekly at Hilton Me-
morial Chapel on Tuesdays at
7 p.m. The purpose of the Chris-
tian Science college group on
campus is to “enlighten the Uni-
versity community concerning
Christian Science and to provide
opportunities for fellowship and
activity among members of the
University who are interested in
Christian Science.”

student aides appointed by the
Chancellor on the recommenda
tion of the marshal, assist Ander
son in seeing that the students
line up correctly, and are pre
rented in the proper order.

Plans Go Astray

Even with this careful planning,
and ten years experience in carry-
ing out convocation, things can
still happen to upset the plan
Anderson remembers one man
and wife, Dorothy and Robert
who were to receive the same
degree. Dorothy decided after
they were already lined up on
the floor just a few feet from
the Chancellor that it would be
nice for Robert to get his degree
first, so she stepped behind him

put Dorothy where she belonged

fusion.

Anderson says of the
planning required to
convocation success-

reminds everyone of

their responsibility, from the
building and grounds people who
must set up the chairs in the base-
ment, to Chancellor Kimpton him-
self. who must keep the date open,
and arrange for the speaker.

About two weeks before convo-
cation, letters are sent to the ten-
tative list of graduates, telling
them when to appear. With UC
tests as they are, the final plans

^on'Depart men tai Clubs Further
Academic Interests; Study

Language, Medicine ,Physics

Not all University of Chicago student organizations are
academic in nature, but a student who wants to learn about
French culture, or Italian music, art, or literature, increase
his knowledge and skills in physics, improve his understanding
of spoken German, or even learn how to enter medical school
will find a UC club waiting for him. Besides the departmental
groups formed by members of -—--------—

a particular school or depart-
ment for social and academic
purposes, many non departmental
clubs exist for the furthering of
academic interests.

The Physics club, the Humboldt
club,- and others of these groups
report that membership is com-
posed primarily of undergraduate
students, the clubs seldom re-
quire more than slight proficiency
for membership. Of course, the
more a member already knows,
the less will be “over his head.”
For example. Marjorie Levis, pres-
ident of the Italian club, states,
' A knowledge of the Italian lan-
guage is helpful, but not an abso-
lute necessity.” She goes on to say,
“Lectures are often given in Ital-
ian, but the meetings are conduct

can be made only a few days be-
fore convocation, when the final
lists of graduates are available.

Pick Aides

No rehearsals are held for UC
convocations, but the student
aides, who are picked on the basis
of scholarship, contributions to
the life of the University, and
“reasonable pulchritude,” meet to
receive assignments so that at
every place where a student might
become confused, an aide will be
there to steer him correctly.

In case one might think that all
this is quite a lot for one man to
manage. Anderson’s main position
is that of assistant professor of
education and director of student
teaching.

ed in English.” Humboldt club lec-
tures, according to president Wil-
liam Tempter, “are given in sim-
ple German which progressively
become more difficult and inter-
esting as the year draws to a
close.”

The Physics club has the facil-
ities of some electronic equipment
and a lab room in the basement
of Ryerson for the projects which
its members undertake, although
Rob Marcus, past president of the
group notes that members take
part in the projects only “if they

so wish.” This year the club
work with a large Tesla coil
radio astronomy. Speakers
tours were sponsored by

will
a nd
and
the

groups last year and plans are to
continue this program. Meetings
are held on alternate Wednesdays
starting October 6, in Eckhardt
209 at 7:30 p.m.

Of the Pre Medical club, W. R.
Wilson, past president, says. “The
club has three main functions.
Regular weekly meetings and fre-
quent social events give members
a chance to get acquainted with
students with similar interests. At
the meetings, speakers, films, and
student discussions give members
a chance to find out more about
the fields they are interested in
and to get useful information
about medical school require-
ments, finances, the draft, etc.” A
picnic for new members is plan-
ned at the point early in October,
according to Wilson.

THE CHICAGO MAROON.

September 24, 1954

Student Clubs Sail,

Shoot, Run, Racquet

Four of the many clubs and groups on campus are distin-
guished by their particular athletic aims.

The Rifle Club promotes absolute control and coordination
with small arms. The Track Club furthers participation in
cross country, track, and field events.

The Badminton Club advances friendly play of that sport;

and the Sailing Club seeks to
develop efficient — and up-
right — sailors.

The Rifle Club was once gener-
ally known as the Rifle and Pistol
Qub, but, according to one school
of small arms lore, abandoned
the smaller arms because the
walls of the Fieldhouse practice
range are too thin to withstand
the impact of a pistol bullet. Rifle

Lurching, jumping, and leaning,
three WAA members gain "relief
from the tensions of academic
work."

coach Frank Karcher’s comment:
“We won’t go into that or talk
about it.”

“We’d Desire”

Coach Karcher did go into his
Club’s program for the coming
year. Students who wish to take
part in it need only a “desire to
do.” Rifles, shooting-coats, and
scopes for precision shooting are
provided by the club. Skill with a
rifle will be developed throughout
the year, and can be demonstrated
in matches every two weeks and
in the big annual Western Con-
ference match.

The Track Club is a recent addi-
tion to official campus groups.
Existing informally since 1950, it
became an officially organized
student activity only last year.

The reason for an organization
beyond the varsity track and cross
country teams lies in the great
number of graduate students at
the University.

Run for Fun

Many of these have exhausted
their college eligibility but con-
tinue to “run for fun.” And so the
Track Club gives Jhem sponsor-
ship. Members of'active varsity
and JV teams also compete under

day afternoons from November 7,
the Club plays intrasquad games
and against other local clubs.
After games the coed group usual-
ly holds informal get togethers.

Sailors Begin Sailing

Tomorrow will find UC sailors
oufon Lake Michigan, getting the
Fall sailing season underway.
Downtown at Columbia Yacht
Club the Sailing Club shares a
fleet of boats with the clubs of
Northwestern and Illinois Tech.

These facilities are open to all
club members every w’eekend and
on several weekdays through
November.

Columbia Y. C. is also, the Chi-
cago area center for inter-collegi-
ate racing. All three local schools
are regular members of the Mid-
west Collegiate Sailing Associa-
tion (MCSA).

The Association provides a
full program of regattas for
twenty-six schools, from Ohio to
Minnesota.

Team Travels

This Fall the UC racing team
will travel to Michigan State,
Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well
as sponsoring two meets here.
The athletic department has an-
nounced that it is considering giv-
ing awards in sailing, the only
inter-collegiate sport in which
both men and women compete.

The Midway mariners also pro-
vide a program of instruction in
elementary and advanced sailing
and racing for club members.
Parties following every regatta
round out the sailors’ program.

Intramural Sports
BeginSoon;Tennij
Tou ch ba 11 Featu re

Intramural Director K o o m a n
Boycheff announced that entries
for intramural touchball and ten-
nis close on October 2. College,
fraternity and divisional houses
that wash to enter teams should
file their entries with him in
Bartlett 105 before that date.

Competition between seven-man
touchball teams will begin Octo-
ber 11. Most games played in the
college and divisional house
leagues will take place on the
sunken grassy part of the Mid-
way. The fraternity hquse league
will play on North Field, behind
the fieldhouse. No blocking is al-
lowed in these games.

Tennis competition begins the
same day. Organizations may en-
ter any number of two-man
teams. Each team may play two
singles and one doubles match.
Matches are decided by the best
two out of three, and the series
by the best two out of three
matches. Holders of the major
“C” in tennis are not allowed to
cQmpete.

Two other intramural sports
are scheduled this autumn. En-
tries close for table tennis com-
petition on October 16. Play be-
gins October 20. Teams of six men
will play six singles and three
doubles matches. The best two out
of three 21 point games wins a
match.

Swimming entries close Novem-
ber 2. Competition in that sport
begins November 9. Six events in-
cluding two relays will be run off
in Bartlett pool. As with tennis,
no holders of the varsity “C” in
the sport are allowed to compete
in the intramurals.

this sponsorship.

Last year’s Club activities were
various but successful. On
Thanksgiving Day the team won
the Central AAU 5,000 meter run.
On New Year’s Day they sponsored
a “holiday meet” which attracted
Don Gehrman, Lawton Lamb, and
many other Midwest stars. In
June they relaxed after the CYO
meet by picnicking at the point.

Lawton Lamb is the only Track
Club member who is not now a
registered student. Coach Ted
Haydon will welcome anyone who
likes to run—whether of Lamb’s
caliber or not — in Washington
Park during the fail, in the Field-
house in winter, and on Stagg
Field during the spring.

The Badminton Club is more so-
cial than the rifle or Hack groups.

Women's Athletics Highlight
Annual Basketball Tourney

This is the year of the 20th annual Women’s Athletic Asso-
ciation (WAA) Basketball Playday. It is the largest event of
the largest women’s association on campus. Between eighty
and one-hundred members of WAA will take some role in
this year’s competition.

The Playday will involve up to fifteen other schools and

will be open to all women stu-
dents.

Preceding each year’s event
is an intramural and interdorm
basketball tourney to determine
the four teams that will represent
Chicago in interschool play.

Although these four have not
been extremely successful in the
past, WAA feels that the Playday
fulfills its purpose: “to increase a
student’s circle of acquaintances

in addition to improving sport
skills and providing a relief from
the tensions of academic work.”

The annual spring awards ban-
quet is the other big yearly WAA
activity. Miss Martha Kloo, WAA
faculty sponsor, and Elenie Kosto-
poulos, this year's WAA president,
will preside. “C” sweaters and big
and little “C” letters will again
be awarded for consistently out-
standing performance.

I WAS AWARDED A RIBBON

AND PROMPTLY PUT IT IN MY TYPEWRITER

First of all —how come?

How do I come to be writing a column for Philip Morris in your
campus newspaper?

I’ll tell you how come:

It all began on a summer night. The air was warm, the sky was
full of stars, and I sat in a cane-bottomed chair on my verandah,
J>eaceful and serene, smoking a cigarette, humming the largo from
)eath and Transfiguration, and worming my dog.

Into this idyllic scene came a stranger — a tall, clean limbed
stranger, crinkly-eyed and crooked-grinned, loose and lank. “How
do you do,” he said. “My name is Loose Lank and I am with the
Philip Morris people.”

“Enchanted,” I said. “Take ott your homburg and sit down.” I
clapped my hands. “Charles!” I called. “Another chair for Mr. Lank.”

Obediently my dog trotted away and returned directly with a
fan-back chair of Malays rattan. He is the smartest dog in our block.

“I’m sorry I don’t have a Morris chair,” I said to Mr. Lank. “That
would be rather more appropriate — you being with Philip Morris
and all.”

Well, sir, we had many a laugh and cheer over my little witticisni.
When we had finished laughing and cheering, we wiped our eyes and
Mr. Lank pulled out a fresh package of Philip Morris. He yanked
the tape and the pack sprang open with a fetching little snap.

“Did you hear that fetching little snap?” asked Mr. Lank.

“Yes,” I said, for I did.

“Cigarette?” he said.

“Thank you,” I said.

We puffed contentedly for three or four hours. Then Mr. Lank
said, “I suppose you’re wondering why I’m here.”

“Well,” I replied, my old eyes twinkling, “1’11 wager you didn't
come to read my meter.”

You can imagine how we howled at that one!

“That’s a doozy!” cried Mr. Lank, giggling wildly. “I must re-
member to tell it to Alice when I get home.”

“Your wife?” I said.

“My father,” he said.

“Oh,” I said.

“Well,” he said, “let's get down to business ... How would you like
to write a campus column for Philip Morris?”

“For money?” I said.

“Yes,” he said.

“My hand, sir,” I said and clasped his. Warmly he returned the
pressure, and soft smiles played on our lips, and our eyes were bright
with the hint of tears, and we were silent, not trusting ourselves
to speak.

“Cigarette?” he said at length.

I nodded.

We lit up and puffed contentedly for eight or ten hours. “I under-
stand you’ve made quite a study of college students,” said Mr. Lank.

“Yes,” I said, blushing modestly. “I have been collecting them for
years. I have over four thousand students in my basement right now.”

“In mint condition?” he said incredulously.

“Students don’t come in mint condition,” I explained. “They go to
great expense to acquire the ‘beat-up look.’ ”

“How interesting,” he said. “Tell me something more about them-
their feeding habits, for example.”

“They are omnivores of prodigious appetite,” I said. “It is wise
not to leave food about when they are present. Their favorite food
is a dish called the Varsity Gasser — one scoop raspberry ice, one
scoop raw hamburger, leechee nuts and maple syrup.”

“Fascinating,” said Mr. Lank. “And what are students interested
in chiefly?”

“Each other,” I replied. “Boy students are interested in girl
students, and girl students are interested in bov students.”

"This seems to me an admirable arrangement,” said Mr. Lank.*
“But is it true even in these parlous days of worldwide tension and
dreadful armaments?”

“It is always true,” I said. “It isn't that college students don’t
know what’s going on in the world. They know all too well. They’re
perfectly aware of the number of lumps waiting for them ... But
meanwhile the limbs are springy and the juices run strong and
time is fleeting.”

“What will you write about in your column?” asked Mr. Lank.

4About boys and girls,” I said. “About fraternities and sororities
and dormitories and boarding houses and dances and sleighrides
and hayrides and cutting classes and going to classes and cramming
for exams and campus politics and the profits of bookstores aryl con-
vertibles and BMOCs and BWOCs and professors who write new
texts every year and the world’s slowest humans — the page boys
at the library.”

MAn^ w^‘ y°u s»y a pleasant word about Philip Morris from time
to time?” asked Mr. Lank.

replied, “I can think of no other kind of word to say about
Philip Morris.”

We shook hands again then, and smiled bravely. Then he was gone
— a tall silhouette moving erectly into the setting sun. “Farewell
good tobacconist!” I cried after him. “Aloha, aloha!”

And turned with a will to my typewriter.	©Max shuiman, ism

Runners, Kickers at it Again

Hope for More Laurels;

Expect Many Less Thugs

by Spike Pinney

Both the varsity soccer and cross country teams are looking forward to another interest-
ing season this fall — but in different ways.

Last year’s soccer season was memorable not for its middling 4-won 1-tied 3-lost tally,
but for its violence and roughness. Just how rough the season was may be judged from what
happened to fullback Pete Rosen. He headed the ball the wrong way past his own goalie
Gerry Czamanske to give Wheaton College a 1-0 victory.

That night Rosen was set

Which twin has the medal? Chicago's Frank Lobmos downs his identical
twin brother Ted Loomos (running on the left for Bradley! and three
other doshmen os Chicago beats Bradley, Northwestern ond Loyola tn a
quadrangular meet lost year. Chicago trackmen lost only two meets from
January through June.

upon by thugs; the last words
he remembers hearing before
losing consciousness were: "Cza-
manske sent us.” Both Rosen and
Czamanske were subsequently
chosen to the all-conference team,
possibly for their fighting spirits.

Cross Country Optimist is

The cross country boys look
forward to laurels on their brows
instead of bumps. Undefeated in
eight meets last year, the team
appears stronger than ever. Jim
Flynn, Paul Baptist, Art Omo-
hundro, Ken Stapley, Ray San-
ders, and Johnny Smothers will
be joined by several veteran run-
ners who have transferred to
Chicago. Together the group
should be even more formidable
than last year’s undefeated team.
As Coach Ted Haydon said, “We
look very strong.”

Other varsity teams have varied
expectations. The track team will
do well to repeat their 16-1-2 rec-
ord even with dash and hurdle
star Frank Loomos and many
others returning. Tennis coach

Bill Moyle is repeating his fall
tennis experiment which had
great success last fall but didn’t
prove a panacea for the spring
season.

Bulletin includes information on
the extensive JV program which
follows the varsity setup in al-
most all features except its level
of competition.

Members of Robinhood's Mcrrie
Men at UC conducted o campaign
during the summer to urge UC
students to write their respective
senators to support the then pend-
ing motions for the censuring of
Senator McCarthy.

Shown left are Audrey Stern,
writing letter, and looking on (I.

to

orc Barbaro VogcHonger,

Emil Johnson, Rene Jones, ond
Perry Goldberg.

The Robinhood band sent a letter
to Senator Douglas explaining that
the Merrie Men were opposed to
McCarthy because his influence
stifled free inquiry.

Other Athletics Outlined

Wrestling, swimming, fencing,
basketball and gymnastics begin
practice this fall for their^winter
competition. Chicago’s famous
Acrotheatre, a combination of
tumbling, ballet, adagio and musi-
cal comedy, will work through Lie
year toward their big spring
show.

All athletic regulations, results,
and rewards are listed in the slim
yellow-covered Sports Bulletin,
available in Bartlett Gym and at
the Reynolds Club desk. The

Political Participation Common

In Many Student Groups

University of Chicago students have always been widely
known for their participation in political activity both on and
off campus. Each year new political groups are formed to
meet the changing interests of students.

The most recent additions to the campus political scene have
been Robin Hood’s Merrie Men, Students for Douglas, and

I Maze of Wires, Plugs Don’t

। Muddle UC Phone Operators

The gruff male voice that answers your campus phone with a “Yeah?” at night can easily
be explained by the absence of the trained daytime operators, who vacate the switchboard
at 11 p.m., leaving the switchboard in the hands of the less delicate night guard.

Similar simple explanations are available for your being suddenly included in the date plans
of Barbs and Joe (“Be sure to come formal, kid”), for those resonant clicks and buzzes, and
for the occasional lengthy waits you encounter. 

Committee for Barrett
O’Hara.

Opposes McCarthyism

The Robin Hood group was one
of the largest campus political
groups last spring. The organiza-
tion was formed to fight McCar-
thyism and stand opposed to all
undemocratic political groups.
This summer the Robin Hood
band conducted a letter writing
campaign to urge Illinois senators
to support the censure motions
pending against Senator McCar-
thy.

National Policies Supported

The Students for Douglas is a
temporary organization which
will work for the re-election of
Paul H. Douglas to the U. S. Sen-
ate. Douglas is a former member
of the economics faculty.

The Student-Faculty Committee
for Barrett O’Hara is urging the
reelection of O’Hara to the House
of Representatives. O’Hara is pres-
ently serving in the House. He
represents the second Congres-
sional district of Illinois in which
the University is located.

The Young Republicans and
Young Democrats have chapters
on campus. Both groups support
the political platforms of the two
major parties. The sponsoring of
speakers is one of the main ac-
tivities of these organizations.

NAACP Active

The National Association for
the Advancement of Colored Peo-

UC phones operate on a 24- —
hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week for the campus-only instruments,
basis. New equipment is used There are from 12,000 to 22,90°

I — an 11-place “flexible” switch-
board. When all trunks are in use
sixty-five outgoing and 20 incom-
ing Chicago calls can be handled
। at one time, as well as eight long
distance conversations. These
trunks, wired to 1,900 terminals,
: serve more than 2,000 instru-
ments on campus.

Almost everyone is familiar
with the small switchboards used
in offices. There are 21 such set-
ups on campus, all connected with
the magnified version on the
| sixth floor of the administration
i building.

Lights Show Calls

This board, about 20 feet long,
seats 11 operators in front of its
seven tri-panels. When a call
comes through, a small light
flashes on three different panels.
The first operator to answer the
, fail (and it is within reach of all
eleven) gives forth the familiar
yes please” and gets the desired
dumber by reaching through a
blaze of about twenty wires and
Pushing in the appropriate plug,
' while already cutting in on an-
®ihen- flash. Varied colors of sig-
Kal lights indicate the type of
phone on that line: amber for an
Unrestricted phone, white with a
^oss for a switchboard such as
be one at B-J, and a white one

connections every day.

The switchboard can be oper-
ated manually or. can be convert-
ed to dial use throughout. The
reason why some phones (those
with numbers below 2300) are not
handled by automatic relays is
that some of the phones are re-
stricted to campus use only to
avoid needless expense for the
University.

Relays on Seventh

The relays themselves, housed
on the seventh floor of the Ad-
ministration building, are a maze
of wire that surpasses even that
with which the operators contend
on the switchboard panels. The
wires are connected with little
semi-circular boxes called selec-
tors. A selector consists of discs
the size about that of C-Shop
saucers, and a rod which pushes
them out when a number is dialed
and pushes them back in after
the party hangs up.

The ^lephone exchange also
features a number of gadgets and
special services, such as a mobile
connection to a guard in a car
prowling around the campus from
five in the evening to seven in the
morning, and including a confer-
ence circuit, available to anyone
in the University, on which three
or more people can talk or listen

at the same time. A circular file
listing administrative, faculty per-
sonnel, is available in the tele-
phone office for faster informa-
tion service. Patients are listed
at the Telepage in Billings, and
inquiries about students are re-
ferred to University Information
Service. Direct lines connect the
switchboard with some of the
more important off-campus build-
ings such as the Quadrangle Club
and the Public Administration
building.

Depress Hook Once

There are some things not gen-
erally known about our tele-
phones. For instance, to recall an
operator, it is sufficient to depress
the receiver supports only once.
Apart from the flashing light in
front of the operator, a loud sig-
nal starts ringing in the office,
and keeps ringing until the oper-
ator answers the call.

This monstrous mechanism is
a far cry from the original one-
position board installed in Cobb
Hall. The present set-up, first of
its kind in Chicago, was installed

in July 1949. The room at 601 Ad-
ministration Building was espe-
cially designed for the present
equipment. Twenty-six employes,
besides the night guard, are need-
ed for its operation. Bell Tele-
phone handles maintenance.

“Hold the Line”

This information y as given to
the MAROON by Miss Gladys
Burke, chief operator.

Miss Burke commented on oc-
casional light touches that bright-
en the usually rigorous d a y of
the hard working operator. For
example, persons calling for Bill-
ings personnel often expect the
operators to know their consult-
ants personally. One woman
wanted to speak to “that short old
fellow with the white beard”
while another patient insisted on
being connected to the “one on
the second floor with a cane.”

pies (NAACP) attracts wide par-
ticipation at UC. The recent Su-
prement Court decision barring
segregation in public schools will
probably bring an expansion in
NAACP activities.

The NAACP is not primarily a
political group. The UC chapter
considers those problems and
prejudices which confront the
Negro student in his sphere of ac-
tivity. The chapter works to pro-
mote equality of the rights of
Negro students with those of
other students.

An important yearly activity of
the NAACP is the sponsorship of
a Negro history week in Febru-
ary. The week focuses attention
upon the role of the Negro in
American culture. Exhibits and
lectures highlight this week.

Two student Socialist groups are
presently active at UC. The Social-
ist Club stands for a general pro-
gram of democratic socialists. The
Young Socialist League (YSL)
holds frequent discussions and
talks on socialism. YSL stands
strongly against capitalism and
Soviet communism.

Graduate Group

The Faculty-Graduate Commit-
tee for Peace seeks means of
bringing about peaceful alterna-
tives to present international con-
flicts. The group’s membership
consists mainly of older graduate
students or faculty members.

A widely circulated “Report on
Germany” was prepared by the
Faculty-Graduate Committee for
Peace two years ago. The report
documented and showed concern
for the rearmament of Germany.

Another recently formed group
is the Crusade for Freedom. The
Crusade for Freedom is affiliated
with national groups which con-
sider eastern Europe to be under
the domination of the Soviet
Union.

It's "Frosh" Now

For the first time in many years
the University of Chicago has
“freshmen.”

Until this year there was no
such classification. New students
were called simply “entering stu-
dents.”

Under the old Bachelor’s pro-
gram students received their year
classification according to the
number of comprehensive exam-
inations they passed. An entering
student, therefore, could be
classed as a “third year” student
by placing out of a certain num-
ber of courses.

Under the new AB entering stu-
dents are just called “freshmen.”

“Anyone interested in science fiction, fantasy, or any related field,
or who just feels like attending our meetings, may belong.” Evan H.
Appelman, of the Science Fiction club, said.

“If the student is interested creatively in the science fiction-fan-
tasy field, for example in writing or doing art work, he will find
much sympathetic aid and cooperation from the membership, and
will be able to receive expert criticism from the professionals belong-
ing to the group. If the student simply wishes to enjoy science fic-

tion as a spectator, he or she will
enjoy associating with other en-
thusiasts and with the profession-
als who have developed the field,’’
Appelman promised.

The first autumn meeting will
lx' an audience participation quiz
program with T. E. Dikty. of
Shasta Publishers, as master of
ceremonies. “The production of a
satirical science fiction operetta,
written by the noted science fic-
tion television writer Julian May
Dikty, is contemplated." Appel-
man said of plans for the coming
year.

The club has sponsored a num-
ber of motion pictures on campus,
such as The Shape of Things to
Come and Adam to Atom. Plans

are to sponsor one or more movies
this year, as well as a variety’ of
guest speakers. Possible speakers
for this year are authors Fritz
Leiber, Jr., Frank M. Robinson,
E. Smith and Rog Phillips; and
editors and publishers Ray Pal-
mer, William L. Hamling. and
Beatrict Mahaffey, according to
Appleman, who is a member of
the programming committee.

In addition to about 20 student
members, the club has about 30
members at-large. Including fac-
ulty, alumni, students at other
Chicago universities, editors, pub-
lishers. authors, and other persons
living in the Chicago area who
are interested in science fiction.

UC Encampment
Studies Government
Active Democracy

The Encampment for Citizen-
ship is connected with the En-
campment held in New York City,
which includes young people from
all geographic, racial, religious
and economic backgrounds.

The campus group, as is the oth-
er, is centered around the study
of democratic government in ac-
tion, and sponsors educational pro-
grams and encourages recruiting
for the Encampment for Citizen,
ship.

Anyone Interested In the F>
campment’s program may join He
will be informed and encouraged
in the ideal of democracy, accord-
ing to Hugh Brodkey, the presi-
dent.

Lectures, workshops, and dis-
cussion groups are planned for
the near future.

Houses Exchangees

Supplementing the formal educational facilities of Chicago
for the student who comes from abroad is one of America’s
unique institutions — International House. To this residence
each year come more than 1,000 college students and teachers
from about 40 foreign countries and from all over the United
States.

The group life stress the
promotion of international un-
derstanding among individuals
of diverse nationalities and in-
terests.*

In its physical facilities. Inter-
national House is equipped with
many conveniences. The dormi-
tory has accommodations for 524
men and women students, each
resident having a combined study
and bedroom of his own. com-
pletely furnished and according
to a former resident, unusually
comfortable. Linens are supplied,
as well as maid service.

Many recreational facilities are
available to members of the
House. In addition to the general
lounges and reception rooms,
both men and women have social
rooms within their dormitories.
On another floor are six rooms

where national and international
groups gather for discussions,
teas, banquets, committee meet-
ings, informal dances, and similar
affairs

A large dining room offers
cafeteria service at reasonable
rates with a varied menu of
American and foreign dishes. In
addition, there is a coffee shop
open throughout the afternoon
and evening for light refresh-
ments

Other facilities, such as a bar-
ber shop, a valet shop, a gift
shop, and the like, are maintained
for the convenience of residents.

International House is situated
between two of Chicago’s most
extensive parks, yet within easy
reach by IC, bus and streetcar of
every part of the city.

Fraternities...

(from page Hi

fees according to Stone, run from
$40 to $100. Fraternity room and
hoard expenses are roughly equal
to those of university housing,
with room costing from $25 to $30
a month, suppers costing about $1
and lunches from 60 cents.

Those who dislike dormitory
life may find the atmosphere of
fraternities refreshing. Although
some time of each member’s rou-
tine must be set aside for frater-
nity activities, fraternities do ob-
serve “quiet hours" which is more
than can be said for most dormi-
tories.

Barriers Falling

The natural, but unfortunate,
by-product of fraternity cama-
raderie has been a tendency for
UC chapters to become clannish,
something about which Chancel-
lor Kimpton chided them. The In-
ter-Fraternity council is fighting
this tendency by encouraging
fraternity wo > projects and fra-
temity-sponsored all-campus func-
tions. The walls which many fra-
ternities have set up between

material taken into an organism
for growth, work or repair, and
for maintaining the vital proc-
esses. The complex organic sub-
stances that form a large portion
of the food of animals fall into
three main classes: proteins, car-
bohydrates, and fats. Cf. CAL-
ORIE. VITAMIN; nutriment in
solid form, anything that nour-
ishes or sustains.

Like solid nutriment for ani-
mals; a large portion of the res-
taurants in the UC area may be
said to fall into three main class-
es: those on campus itself, those
from 58th street north to 53rd
street, and those from the Midway
south to 63rd. Whether, and how
well they will nourish and sustain
you depends to a large degree on
your supply of the medium of ex-
change, and the measure of value
you place upon it.

Going towards campus from
53rd, we first find Pane’s pizzeria
just past the Illinois Central
tracks on 53rd. A half a block
closer, on the corner of 53rd and
Lake Park, are the B/G and Le-
Meck’s. B/G is proud of its bot-
tomless cup of coffee, i.e. for a
dime the waitress will fill your
cup all night.

List Service

Its egg rolls are particularly
worth trying.

Cones Offered

Finally, if you want an ice
cream cone, you can get a large
one for ten cents at the corner of
55th and University.

Moving down to 57th, we first
come to two new restaurants, both
established within the las* year.
First, there is the Gourmet, on
the corner of 57th and Lake Park.
The dinners there, which can be
bought for under $3. are sufficient
in both taste and quantity, al-
though it has been said by at least
one student that it has continental
pretensions without continental
quality. The Mecca is rep*.ted to
have good exotic dinners (though
it is not a place to go for a snack)
and a choleric chef.

On the southwest corner of 57th
and Kenwood there is Stineway’s.
The place burned down a few
years ago, and the rebuilt version
features a fishbowl-like plate glass
window along 57th. The furnish-
ings are real collegiate. The prices
are exorbitant.

S

A typical bus stop in Chicago's
transportation system, as students
embark on a guided tour of the
city.

Public transportation in the city of Chicago suffers from
a well-seated reputation for being slow, complicated, and
roundabout. However, most authorities will agree that while
almost all of the complaints were justified as recently as five
years ago, there has since been a general improvement in the
services offered.

If you want to arrive at your destination quickly, the first
general rule to remember is: disregard the official instructions.
Both the Chicago Transit Authority and the Illinois Central

LeMeck’s is connected with a
bar, goes in for lengthy service,
real linen napkins, intimate light-
ing, and shrimp cocktails, which
contain three shrimps, a leaf of
lettuce, and lots and lots of ketch-
up, all for 75 cents.

Also on 53rd street is the Hobby
House. Located on Kenwood, it
attempts to provide the real olde

Restaurants Listed

On the same side of the street,
but a few doors down towards the
quadrangles stands Gordon’s.
(There is another Gordon’s on
53rd.) It has piped-in EM music,
somewhat uncomfortable seats,
and reasonable meals available
for approximately 80 cents. Both
Stineway’s and Gordon’s, as well
as the third restaurant on 57th,
the Tropical Hut, are well attend-
ed by students, since they are
very .convenient to campus.

The T-hut has a pseudo South
Seas atmosphere, tries to be high
class. Until last year, girls had to
wear dresses after 9 p.m. to get in.
There is also a headwaiter. Prices
ahd sandwichy foods are similar
to that of Gordon's.

On the corner of 58th and Cot-
tage Grove there is a surprisingly
clean “greasy spoon,” where a lot

of truckers and high University,
officials eat. It is within very con-
venient reach of the Administra-
tion building, and of Cobb hall.
Prices are low.

Wampum Illegal

So much for the north side of
the campus eateries. None of the
above places will trade wampum,
and it has been illegal in the US
to possess more than one ounce of
gold, except for ornamental pur-
poses for quite some time.

Of the eating places on campus,
the Hutchinson Commons and the
C- (for all-Chicago) shop are the
most prominent, apart from the
men’s and women's dining halls.
The periodic rumors that the
hamburgers and frankfurters in
the C-shop are either horse meat,
or non-inspected beef are usually
unfounded.

Commons Has Food

The Commons are patterned
after the dining hall of Magdalen
College in Oxford, even unto the
unwashed windows. Portraits of
UC’s famous line the walls. Do not
let .the atmosphere of the place
mislead you: some of the people
in the drawings are still alive. Nor
must you think of the cheerfully
tiled cafeteria line as of the cheer-
ful undertaker’s parlor. Any re-
semblance is purely coincidental.

The food is alleged to be

nutri-

English atmosphere by putting
up* oak paneling, olde English
prints, and a chrome bar. It is
open all night. Lots of students go
there. The olde English prints are
screwed down to the walls. The
barbequed beef sandwich there is
well worth the 85 cents charged,
and its scrambled eggs and toast
are similar in quantity and the 45
cent price to any served at the
63rd street greasy spoons, while
they are infinitely more hygenical.

On 55th street, in a position
analogous to that of Pane’s on
53rd, there is the Good Eats cafe.
Run by a Japanese couple, it has
a few Japanese dishes on the.
menu, as well as a large selection
of complete home cooked dinners.

with

cents

On

a price range between 90
and $1.40.

Serve Pizza

55th and Lake Park, dis-

tributed on both sides of the street
are the Highland, Gladys’s and
Pizzeria Como. Of these, the piz-
zeria is worthy of note for its
really ample and well-cooked hot
sandwiches.

Further down, on 55th and
Kimbark, there is another Italian
tan rant. Nicky’s, open Satur-
days until 4 a.m., other days until
2- It will deliver a small pizza
for 85 cents.

Of all the Chinese restaurants
on 55th, Jane Lee’s on the corner
11 Woodlawn and 55th stands out
: insofar as the size of the meals,
size of the prices, and amount oY
cleanliness go.

w



And then I got off at 63rd Street

tious. Despite all these things, you
can usually get a good meal there
for around 85 cents.

In B-J basement there is a
snack-bar run by students. It is
usually open evenings, although
the hours vary occasionally, and
makes very good and cheap sand-
wiches. Billings hospital has a
cafeteria, adorned with murals,
which the students may use. The
food there should be nutritious.

In the International House,
there is a good cafeteria * which
serves a greater variety of food
than any other on campus. There
is also a snack shop, open till 10:15
p.m.

The Bookstore, opposite Cobb
hall, sells sandwiches, cookies,
candy, and strange hot dogs, cut
open on both ends. The hot dogs
emerge from the electric warmer
wrapped in wax paper, which is
secured with a piece of colorful
tape. Unlike many items in the
Bookstore, this piece of tape is
free, and you may keep it after
you have.eaten the sandwich.

The Italian Fiesta Pizzeria
serves excellent pizza and pro-
vides a convenient delivery serv-
ice from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m., seven
days per week. The Fiesta special
is well worth trying. It is a large
pizza divided in quarters, with
mushroom, sausage, peppers, an-
chovies. Italian Fiesta Pizzeria is
located at 1437 E. 67th street.

In the opinion of MAROON
staffers, the best low to medium
priced dinner in the University
area is served at the Collier House
restaurant. The menu does not
offer a wide selection, but all
items are the closest to home
cooking away from home. Collier
House is located at 6324 Wood-
lawn avenue.

No Discrimination

On 61st and Ellis, only a block
from B-J is Reader’s the drugstore
with a turnstile, and ten-year-old
photographs of the campus. The
red C-sticker, which you will see
on the door, means only that the
restaurant does not discriminate.
It does not imply any other form
of approval on the part of the Stu-
dent Government.

Alexander’s is one of the two
major restaurants on 63rd. The
other one is another Hobby
House, on 63rd and Kenwood. Lo-
cated half a block east of Univer-
sity. it is open all night. It, too,
serves not too-bad dinners until
9 p.m.

Two “greasy spoons” along 63rd
are worth mentioning. The first,
on University, is also unusually
clean. The other, on Greenwood,
while hygienically somewhat im-
perfect is the only one open all
night for the space of eight
blocks. You can get meals in both
for 40-50 cents. The ptomaine row
stretches ahead. Did you know
that an ancient Greek tradition
had it that once you have par-
taken of the food of the dead, you
can never leave Hades?

suburban service issue direc-
tions which are simple to fol-
low, but which are not really
convenient.

Give Shortcut

The commuter from N6rth and
West sides will find that he can
save as much as ten minutes by
disembarking on the 51st street
“L” station, instead of at 63rd and
University. He then takes the bus
which, going east and south, will
turn into Cottage Grove, and
eventually into 55th. Getting off
at Ellis, he is three blocks north of
Cobb hall. Ellis is recognizable by
the large Frolic theatre marquee
three doors from the corner.

When you oversleep on the
train and miss 51st street, you can
still get off at 61st street if you
are on a “B” (Jackson Park) train.
You then catch the bus going cast,
and arrive back of Burt on-Judson,
by Reader’s drugstore.

There is a station called Univer-
sity on 63rd street (the “L” has
turned due east on 63rd) which
you can reach by continuing to
ride your “B” train. However,
your ride there will be interrupted
by a wait en route in the CTA
switching yards, and you will have
to backtrack four to five long

blocks

Tell Advantages

There is one more advantage to
taking the 51st-55th route over the
other two: you will not have to
cross the Midway during the win-
ter, and no one who doesn't have
to do it should attempt it: it's
pretty cold with the east wind
blowing, and both the through
streets and the wooden walks are
slippery. The first time you slip
off the University ave. walk and
land up to your thighs in snow
and muck, you are liable not to
appreciate it.

* The trip from the Loop to Cobb
hall via 51st street has been timed
at 28 minutes.

Both the commuters and the
students who live on the Quad-
rangles will probably appreciate
the 12 minute ride from 57th to
the Loop offered by the Illinois
Central. IC carries smoking com-
partments in the north end of the
train (no matter which way the
train'is going). All the express
trains stop at 57th street station;
none of the specials do.

Explain Stops

Watch out for the IC nomen-
clature. All IC stations are named
after two or more streets, since
they are a block long. Thus the
57th street station is the 55th. 56th
and 57th st. station, with exits
on all three.

IC is the best means of trans-
portation into the Loop if you are
within convenient walking dis-
tance of either of the two “Univer-
sity” stations. However, there is
no transfer service between IC
and CTA. IC trains are scheduled
eight minutes apart during the
day.

CTA provides a better service
at night. The 55th street bus stops
at Ellis a quarter of an hour be-
fore and after a given hour after
midnight. The 51st st. “L” comes
every 15 minutes during the “owl”
hours.

As far as discounts provided by
the two services are concerned,
IC issues, at reduced rates, ten
and 30 ride commutation tickets.
College commuters who have not
yet received their 12th grade cer-
tificate are eligible for the CTA
student pass, which entitles you
to a ten cent ride at any time of
the day or night.
