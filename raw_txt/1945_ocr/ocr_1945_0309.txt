U of C in BIG TEN DEBATE

Phoenix Due;
First Edition
March 21st

Phoenix, a new news magazine,
which will give complete coverage of
major events, actions, and ideas will
appear on campus on March 21st. The
new publication has received official
recognition from the Office of The
Dean of Students subject to submis-
sion of proof of financial stability.
Bill Lenz, Bill Washington, and Bob
Mittenbuhler, The Board of Control,
have this proof and are ready to start
work on the first edition. Bill Lenz,
editor, declares that the feature de-
partment “will atten.pt to give criti-
cal analyses of lectures, music, and
art . . . will be a catalyst for creative
talent on campus,” the news will be
“objective” and “though the editorial
policy will be specific and liberal,
there will be an attempt to cover all
sides and space will be given to any
person with reasonable ideas.”

“An attempt will be made to stir up
student - interest in problems con-
fronting them as students of the
world,” Lenz said.

He added that the name of the pa-
per was selected as a symbol of the
University of Chicago and its stu-
dents ... a symbol of a fighting de-
termination to progress.

The faculty adviser for Phoenix
will be Professor Mortimer J. Adler.

Mr. Lenz also added that there are
editorial positions and reporters’ jobs
open to interested students.

Britannica Aid
For Graduate
StudentsOpen

Three graduate fellowships to the
University of Chicago for students
interested in undertaking research
to improve children’s encyclopaedias
and their utilization will be awarded
by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.,
President Robert M. Hutchins an-
nounced.

The fellowships, ranging from
$1,000 to $2,000, will cover three
quarters of work in the 1945-46 school
year. Graduate students who have
completed a master’s degree or its
equivalent are eligible for the fellow-
ships. Their advanced work at the
University of Chicago will be done
in either the Department of Educa-
tion or the Graduate Library School.

Applications for the fellowships
may be secured from Stephen M.
Corey, Professor of Educational Psy-
chology, University of Chicago.

Shamrock Hop
Next C Dance

Following a cabaret theme the Stu-
dent Social Cpmmittee presents the
last of its dances for the quarter
tomorrow night, the Erin Shenanig-
ans. Ida Noyes gym is the scene
and the “Shenanigans” will continue
from 8:45 through 11:45 p.m.

What’s Behind This
Tuition Rumor?

An Editorial

Like drops of oil on a cement floor, rumors that the tuition
would rise in the future spread out over the campus this week. At
first taking the appearance of chit-chat, the story that the adminis-
tration would be forced to ask for an increase in tuition gradually
gained form until, at printing, the rumor seems substantial enough
to indicate that the measure will be taken.

Unofficial hypotheses are rampant. Some ideas offered put
light on the fact that less interest is expected on the investments
of the University. Hence a loss. In the recent comptroller’s report,
part of which was reproduced in the University of Chicago Maga-
zine, any Soc. 2 student can see that a drop in interest of no
more than one per cent would cause a loss of $700,000 a year.

Another version, which seems valid enough, is that added on
to the probable loss through investments, the University plans to
increase its student aid program over the $600,000 mark of last
year.

With these facts in mind, our office theorists say, it can easily
be understood why the administration, when faced with the choice
of cutting student aid or getting the money elsewhere, decided on
the latter.

Then there are some who say that the increase will never be
wanted, needed, or sought by the University.

Receipts for
Red Cross
Drive $341

Receipts for the two day Red Cross
campaign on campus have been an-
nounced by the chairman of the drive,
Bibs Ludgin. The total collected in
the booths by the club women is
$341.00. Ninety-three membership
cards were given on the basis of do-
nations of $1.00 or more. Miscellane-
ous donations, placed in the Red Cross
boxes, make up the rest of the present
total. There have also been pledges
received from two of the women’s
clubs and $15.70 from the Judson 300
entry.

Pledge cards have been circulated
in the dormitory by Red Cross repre-
sentative but the totals have not been
released as yet. In Green and Beecher
Halls, apples were sold for the bene-
fit of the Red Cros. Chances for three
packages of cigarettes are being sold
in Green. Foster Hall is planning a
benefit basketball game.

Theater managers have requested
the aid of College students in the be-
tween-shows collections. Volunteers
have been requested for the Frolic
Theater between Ingleside and Ellis
on 55th to take up collections on
March 15 through March 21. Dona-
tions will be collected four times a
day. Ten of the members of Pi Delta
Phi will take donations at United
Artists theater in the loop on March
16. Volunteers have been requested
to see Bibs Lurgin, Room 37, Beecher
Hall,___________________________

Just before we Go Home note:

The resolution decided last night
for the Big Ten Debate tournament
is as follows: “Resolved that the
United Nations should apply econ-
omic control to Germany for at
least 25 years.” ■

Scholarships
To Be Awarded
For Next Year

One hundred and fifty scholarships,
valued at $75,000 for the 1945-46
school year, will be awarded in the
College of the University to students
who have completed the sophomore,
junior or ^pnior years in high school,
President Robert M. Hutchins an-
nounced.

The scholarships, to be granted in
nation-wide competition held April 21,
1945, are awarded from the uni-
versity’s $594,912 annual budget for
aid to students attending the univer-
sity. Last year the university pre-
sented scholarships and fellowships
in a cash amount large enough to
carry the expenses of a moderate-
sized community.

The College scholarships, to be
awarded either for the June or Sep-
tember quarter, will be granted on
the basis of aptitude examinations
testing the student’s ability to learn,
not what he already konws.

The College, now in its third year
under the famous New Plan, has an
enrollment of 1,932, and is the fastest
growing college in the nation. Regis-
tration in the first and second years—
traditionally the junior and senior
years in high school—showed a 100
per cent increas last September over
the registration of the preceding
year.

College scholarships wjll be award-
ed on the basis of high school records
and performance in the four-hour ex-
amination, testing clear and critical
thinking, understanding of words and
concepts, familiarity with important
facts and ideas, ability to deal with
numbers and familiarity with appre-
ciation of the arts, including litera-
ture.

Chicago Debaters
Defend Title Today

University of Chicago debaters are fighting today at North-
western University to retain the Western Debating Conference
co-championship won last year. All of the member Universities
of the Big Ten are represented.

In a contest last Friday, judges Hans J. Morgenthau, Visiting
Associate Professor of Political Science, Albert W. Levi, Visiting
Assistant Professor of Social Science, and Chester H. Cable,
Instructor in English selected Abe Krash, William Sparks, Robert
Voas, and Philip Nymeyer to comprise the debating team repre-

senting the University at the Big Ten Conference today. The four
winners, plus Eugene Anderson, Curtis Crawford, and Albert
Friedlander, also selected last Friday have participated in three
rounds of discussion at Northwestern with the members of the
other teams.

During the first round, participants met in groups of eleven
to define and analyze the question “What Shall We Do With
Germany After the War?”

In the second session the various groups set up the goals on
standards their resolution should meet. All possible solutions were
submitted and one selected which would best provide an answer
to the problem. At the conclusion of this round, one person from
each group was elected to meet with the members of the other
groups to draw up resolutions for the next session.

Two Short Plays
Qn Theatre Group
Docket for Today

Orfering its third production of the
Winter Quarter, the experimental
theatre group will present a program
of two short plays this afternoon at
3:45 in the Ida Noyes East Lounge.
Strindberg’s scene, “The Stronger”
and Alfred Kreymbourg’s puppet
play, “Miniken and Manikin,” will be
given. Roberta Unger, familiar to
campus audiences for her work in
“Kind Lady”, “Inspector General”
and “The Astonished Heart”, will
play the actress Mrs. X, and Jean
Cooke, her silent friend, Miss Y. Sonia
Friedman and Sid Burks will take
part in the Kreymbourg piece. Both
Sid Burks and Jean Cook were last

Concert Features
Violin, Harpsichord

This evening at 8:30 in Mandel
Hall, the Department of Music will
present Alexander Schneider, violin-
ist, and Ralph Kirkpatrick, harpsi-
chordist, in the fifth Chamber Concert
of the current series. The program
will consist of the following: Sonata
No. 7, G Major by Biber; Sonata No. 3,
E Minor by Bach; Sonata in C Major,
Kochel No. 396 by Mozart; Ritratto
dell’ Amore by Couperin; and Sonata,
D Major, Kiichel No. 306, also by
Mozart.

Biber was the first German violin
composer of note; the work to be
played is one of sixteen “biblical son-

(Continued on page 6)

During round three resolutions
were read and discussed in a parlia-
mentary session including all par-
ticipants.

Abe Krash, first negative speaker,
is a native of Cheyenne, Wyoming,
and two-time Wyoming State Orator-
ical champion. In the third year of
the College, Krash was recipient of
many awards in the field of forensics.

William Sparks, second negative
speaker, formerly from Knox College
and Georgetown University, is in the
fourth year of the College. He was
a radio script writer for the O.P.A.
and a frequent participtant in Stu-
dent Forum Activities.

Philip Nymeyer, speaking in the
affirmative, is a fourth year student,
formerly of Englewood High School.
Nymeyer was active in high school
forensics, where he met with frequent
success.

Robert Voas also speaking in the
affirmative is in the third year of the
College and was the speech champion
and debater at St. John Vocational
High School, New Brunswick, Cana-
da.

Dale M. Stucky, student in the Law
School, is sponsoring the Chicago
group in his capacity as Director of
the Student Forum. Stucky observes
that the University of Chicago is un-
usual in the Big Ten group, since our
participants are drawn from the stu-
dent body at large, while the other
schools usually depend on their
schools of speech or debate to train
contestants for the meet. In spite
of this knowledge, he adds, the Uni-
versity has more than held its own
in the annual debates and stands a
good chance this year.

Diedrich

Predicts

To prevent postwar over-enroll-
ment now in the offing for univer-
sities, larger cities must adopt the
6-4-4 system in their schools, with or
without the bachelor’s degree at the
end, according to Paul B. Diederich,
Assistant Professor of Education at
the University?

College enrollment after the war
will be doubled by the veterans re-
turning to school and the number of
youth whose place in the labor market
will decline sharply as veterans crowd
them out of the available jobs, Prof.
Diederich warns in the University
of Chicago’s education journal for
March, The School Review, in an ar-
ticle on “Simplifying A Crowded
Schedule.”

“If existing colleges cannot meet
the situation—and no one pretends
they can—then the larger city school
systems will have to,” Prof. Diederich
writes. “The situation is made to
order for them to do what they have
long wanted to do anyway.

“Until new buildings can be built,
the easiest way to take care of an in-
flux of students beyond grade twelve
will be to turn the present senior
high schools into four-year colleges
beginning with grade eleven and the
junior high schools into four-year
high schools, covering grades, seven,
eight, nine and ten.

“Already the University of Chicago
has cast a powerful stone at the
present structure of the liberal arts
college by granting the bachelor’s
degree at the end of the usual sopho-
more year and by adding the last two
years of the usual high school to its
college program,” Prof. Diederich
continues.

“If the Chicago plan does not be-
come universal, it will at least be
tried in enough places to have a
powerful influence on the development
of the secondary school program.”

Criticizing the forty-minute class
periods in high schools for “produc-
ing a generation of young people
who, for all their virtues, are ob-
viously overstimulated, unintegarted,
and superficial and for making hash
of “the lives of teachers,” the Univer-
sity of Chicago professor calls for a
reorganization of the academic day.

— THE CHICAGO MAROON

Campus To Have Conference
On Bases for Social Action
Early in Coining Quarter

Plans are being formed for a week long Conference on the
Bases of Social Action to be held on campus early next quarter.
The purpose of the conference is to provide an opportunity for
campus-wide study of the reasons why we, as individuals and
groups, do or should participate in social and political action.
The wide interest in the problems of the coming peace and con-
temporary legislation makes the meeting especially revelent.

Dormitories, clubs, and other groups on campus will be asked
to hold special meetings, according to present plans for the
conference. It is hoped that there can be a large meeting on
Thursday night and an afternoon and evening retreat on Saturday.

The conference is sponsored by a
special “Commission on the Bases of
Social Action.’” It has also been
discussed and endorsed by the new
“Council on Social Problems” as well
as by the Y.W.C.A., Chapel Union and
Interchurch Council Janet Davidson
and Malcolm McAfee are co-chairmans
of the Commission. Julia Marwick
is chairman of the speakers committee,
Dick For stall is secretary, and Joe
Brady is in charge of special arrange-
ments. Some fifteen other students
are members of the Commission, and
Professor Winthrop Hudson, Acting
Dean of the Disciples Divinity House,
is the Faculty Advisor.

“The adoption of a program of
postwar universal military training
will strengthen the current and future
unity and effectiveness of the United
Nations by showing that the United
States intends to assume its respon-
sibility toward the maintenance of the
peace.” With that statement, Miss
Winifred Norman, national officer of
American Youth for Democracy and
of the National Negro Congress, de-
clared A.Y.D. to be in favor of the
principle of postwar military train-
ing. Miss Norman spoke to an open
meeting of the campus chapter of
A.Y.D. Tuesday afternoon in Swift
Commons.

Last Tuesday the Documentary
film group presented a well-received
program of war films. Presented by
the U. S. Marine Corps and the
British government, the pictures were
both accurate and informative.

“Air Operations” was a realistic
feature showing the complete story
of a British bombing raid over the
continent. It was very well filmed
with some unusual lighting effects
and good art shots.

“Battle for the Mariannas” was
also well done. Both the narration
and filming were excellent. The good
and bad sides of the Mariannas strug-
gle were presented in an accurate,
well-defined style.

“Road to Paris” showed the ad-
vance of American troops across
France and their entry into the
French capital. The filming, par-
ticularly the close-up shots of De
Gaulle, was exceptionally good. “Road
to Paris” completely captured the en-
thusiasm and gratitude of the French
people on their day of liberation.

Women

The University of Chicago was the
first major university which from the
day of its establishment accepted
women as students on an equal basis
with mtn. The university, likewise,
was the first to initiate the quarter
system in place of the traditional
semester division of the year, thereby
for the first time affording university
students the opportunity to attend

school during the summer months.

Babies

A daughter born to a Chicago couple
March 1 was the 40,000th baby born
in Lying-in Hospital and Dispensary
at the University of Chicago since the
building on campus was opened May
25, 1931. The girl was the 113,763rd
baby born since the maternity hos-
pital was founded in another part of
the city fifty years ago. The number
compares with the population of Nor-
folk, Va., which is 144,000.

Presidents

Two presidents of major univer-
sities have resigned their posts within
the past fifteen months to take im-
portant positions at the University of
Chicago. Reuben G. Gustavson, inter-
nationally known chemist, has ten-
dered his resignation as president of
the University of Colorado to come to
Chicago as dean of the faculties July
1. Joseph A. Brandt resigned as
president of the University of Okla-
homa and came to Chicago as director
of the University Press on January
1, 1944.

ment of Oriental Languages and Lit-
eratures is presenting a series of pub-
lic lectures on Chinese Culture. They
will be given by eminent scholars of
China. Topics included in the series
will be literature, education, society
and philosophy. The first lecture was
given Wednesday night, and the next,

Leininger felt that co-ops must
maintain political neutrality, since
they represent the interests of various
groups. He favored a mixed'economy
in which co-ops did about 25% of the
total business, the government con-
trolled certain industries, and the rest
of the economy was privately owned.
Ann Morrissett and Pfc. Norvell saw
co-ops as a means of obtaining social-
ism and were in favor of Socialists
entering the co-op movement to edu-
cate the members in the significance
of co-operation. Miss Walowitz point-
ed out that economic and political in-
terests are inseparable and that co-
ops should join with labor in a politi-
cal party, as has been done notably in
England, Canada, and Austria. She
refuted Leininger by asserting that
co-ops, which in cities deal primarily
with foodstuffs on the consumer level,
can never of themselves solve the
problem of exploitation on the pro-
duction level, whereby the worker gets
less than the full value of the goods
which he produces and therefore is
unable to buy back his share of the
goods produced.

Where Did They Go?

Six weeks ago, The Chicago Maroon sponsored a meeting of
dormitory students in an effort to gauge the attitude of those stu-
dents on the subject of Student Government. From there on, the
students took over, elected representatives, held two meetings.

At a meeting of commuters, a committee was elected to meet
with dormitory representatives. They met once. Then they met
again. At the last joint meeting a Committee of Six was elected
to study various proposals, choose the best one, and offer it to the
student body for a referendum. Everything seems to be going fine
—except for a few small items. 1.) At the last meeting of all the
representatives, less than half appeared, 2.) the Committee, which
met yesterday, had few plans to examine, 3.) doubt exists that
anyone will be present Wednesday at the next general meeting to
hear what has been decided.

Where are the zealots and the orators and the we-want-a-
representative-student-council men ? Surely the women who were
so interested in their “rights” have not forgotten them. We can-
not believe that the dorm and commuter representatives who
said that they wanted to disolve any distinction between the two
groups, now think it should stand. No, we must be uninformed.

Sure, they have forgotten.	.

But where are they?

Comps are over, a new quarter is coming, we are winning the
war, spring is here, and—could that be it? Sprng?

So Think About It . . .

(Continued from page one)

And what if th increase is coming?

What form will the reaction of the students take?

Will we prance and rave, and paint glaring signs, march to
Mandel Hall, boo the president, send ultimatums, curse capitalism
and the “favored 400” ? Will we imitate, on a more glorious scale,
the actions of the hyper thyroids of that famous institution on the
north side of the City Beautiful? Or will we wait for all the facts?
Will we sit down and think?

From the right to cut classes, down to women’s hours and
heckling Adler, the student has been given the exceptional oppor-
tunity of making his own decisions and finding his own scale of
values. If we students of the University are prone to bigotry and
smugness it is not due to famous football teams or movie star
alumni but because we have a tendency to laud our use of rational
thought and a bit of logic now and then—rarely do we get a chance
to exhibit. But, if the rumors are true, if more money will be
needed for tuition, then this is it. This is our chance to show off
that rationality which is our primary claim to fame.

In the news columns of this paper can be found evidence of
the policy of the University; three fellowships are announced; the
Honor Entrance Scholarships amounting to $594,000. are to be
awarded in the fall quarter; another newspaper will soon appear
on the campus; Labor Rights is affiliating with the USSA. Look
around. Fraternities and AYD on the same campus. Discussion
groups in every entry at Burton and Judson. The young, shaky,
but still existent Student Council, with commuters and dormitory
residents working together for the first time in the history of the
University.

In every instance the Administration has displayed a rational,
and liberal attitude, for the general good of the student body. Now
we have the opportunity to do likewise.

We need not go to extremes in thinking on this problem. And
for some, perhaps many, it will create a problem. We need not be
as precise as Bill Washington when he asked for the formula for
a Windsor Knot. But if we use our minds, instead of our vocal
cords, if we ask for the facts instead of making up our own, if we
seek the answers as students rather than underpaid gladiators,
the Administration will hear us and give us the whole story. And
our calm and rational thinking will have been justified.

More For Your

Since the scope of this column is
necessarily limited, we shall try to
restrict our criticism of the winter
issue of CARILLON to its poetry;
save for the general observation that
its flood of “realistic” prose remains
unchecked. Of the subjective stories,
the most masterful is Marjorie Ladd
Brown’s THE LONG EARTH. It is
most masterful because Miss Brown
has taken the time to draw out her
characters; the others, notably Arlene
Janzig’s HOW GROWS THE GRASS,
seem to be chopped up imitations of
required Humanities readings.

John Harmon’s poem THE HELL-
BENDER suffers from its uncomfort-
able likeness to Van Dyke’s FLOWER
IN THE CRANNIED WALL. The
Romantic technique suffered through-
out the 19th Century from its con-
scious contemplation of poetic objects.
Through THE HELLBENDER would
have not been considered as a poetic
object, Harmon will not be disowned
by his ancestors. He has cast a most
valid sonnetform. The title is un-
fortunate, because HELLBENDER
connotes a vitality which is subse-
quently denied. Indeed, the am-
phibians had to be vital to invade
the land; they bent their environment
by virtue of bending themselves, suf-
fering leaky hearts, which should be
esteemed as sacrifices on the altar of
the Greater Good. Harmon is blind to
this contribution. A particularly good
couplet is

Letters to Editor

U. S. Colleges Hold
Key To Security

(Editor's Note: the following is the
second and concluding installment of
the letter received from 2nd Lt. Rob-

ert Liberman, formerly a student of
the University, and at present a mem-
ber of the A.A.F., overseas. The first
part of the letter ended with the
words, “there are times when it is
hard to decide. . . . The letter con-
tinues.)

There is no remedy for a social evil
that grips so many people as does a
war in modern times. There are only
measures that can help relieve the
intensity of that evil, and is what
the colleges of the U.S. can do mag-
nificently. The returning warrior has
led an unnatural life in many respects.
He has had in most cases a night-
marish emotional existence made
worse by memories. There he has in
some regions of the earth met young
women, he has found them too often
violating the principles of sanitation
to an undreamed of, disgusting ex-
tent. If he has been lucky enough
to avoid this, he has probably found
them otherwise strange in their be-
havior, artificial in their attempts to
please Americans. If ever young boys
needed straightforward, honest, under-
standing young women, now is the
time. The need extends to far more
than human physiology. G.I. Joe
needs to be retaught a lot of notions
and attitudes and a “swell gal” is a
wonderful teacher. To a major ex-
tent the emotional rehabilitation of the
boys who are now fighting depends on
how little the American girl deviates
from the lofty pedestal upon which
the boys have, in their absence, placed
her. Every indication of uncleanli-
ness or superficiality or haughtiness
on her part will unavoidably kill some-

Measure

Sharp shadows across the curving
ridges of the hills.

The line preceding it, “spun bridges
over water, expressions of our
dreams”, could perhaps have been
profitably condensed. We suggest to
Mr. Harmon that he get his philos-
ophy in order. As it is now, his
poetry is somewhat “directionless and
clumsy”, alternately compressed and
diluted, modern in image and archaic
in form. But excellence requires a
long adolescence and Harmon has
power, though it is not yet unified in
an effective blast. We can damn him
where we cannot damn the salaman-
der, for the salamander must be rev-
erenced as a noble ghost. Harmon is
not yet noble, but he is not a ghost.
He is a force, still to fulfill its func-
tion. He can not linger “lost between
the water and the slime.”

Of the others, one is forced to won-
der if QUID MULTA were written in
paragraph form it would still be a
poem. Lincoln Steffans was right:
one cannot criticize white space. . . .
SLUMMING elaborates the triteness
of “carrion beasts”, “romantic mad-
men”, “disquiet ghosts”. .. . RETURN
might have been an acceptable “real-
istic” short story: at least it stands
as a good working outline. . . . THE
CONQUEROR’S quickness of meter
in the closing triplet belies the mood
of futility it attempts to portray. The
images are trite and as everyday as
the intercepting prose line between
the two emotional conditions, as if
Lin Emery suddenly got tired of it all.

thing good and aspiring in him.

But let’s not kid ourselves. What
we can do in aiding an unfortunate

generation is far less than what we
can do in helping build a new strength
in our society, and pitiful as it may
be to see the alert youth of 1940
stagger through the streets in 1945,
a beaten man, we have to turn our
main energies to preventing future
similar disasters. We’ve seen over
on this side of the ocean what a couple
of all-out wars can do to a people,
how it makes for disloyalty, immoral-
ity, hate, and other conditions foreign
to our likings. It could happen just
as inevitably to America.

Our only weapons for defence are
ideas and more ideas. The fight for
a free life and a superior socity is a
fight that doesn’t end or begin with
artillery salvos, or naval bombard-
ments, or aerial attacks, it’s a con-
tinuous fight that is apparently noise-
less and requires good health and
untroubled minds to discern the issues.
America can provide the least
“troubled” minds in all the world by
virtue of her good fortune in being
further from the war’s destructive
aspects than all the other belligerents.
Schools like the U. of C. or North-
western are perfect for just such a
task. There in a beautiful climate and
most friendly spirit a man can pursue
his ambitions in an atmosphere of
freedom and semi-paradise. There he
can leisurely, but earnestly, study
whatever he chooses to master and
discover for himself the relationships
between his chosen field and society
at large. But the time has gone when
one could fairly take all that and give
nothing in return. If we want all
these good things to contine we must
analyze the conditions that threaten
to take these things away from us and
do something about it.

We cannot any more be chemists or
doctors or lawyers or housewives and
let the rest of the world go hang,
because in so doing too many of us
will get “hung” also. We didn’t give
a “damn” in the 1930’s or in the
1930’s and we were promptly damned
in the 1940’s. What happened was
not an accident and can, if we permit
it, happen again.

A man is apparently a strange an-
imal. He’ll build a city energetically
and then a nation. Then he will link
one nation to another with trade and
business. Somewhere along the line,
however, he seems to lose sight of
what he needs more than anything
else in order to maintain and preserve
what he has wrought.

I ask you, his teachers, and you,
his sweetheart, and you his colleagues,
to remind him that the people who
will do the worthwhile things tomor-
row are the ones who are busy master-
ing some one thing today. For the
sake of the most important things in
our lives please help him!

The world over here is just coming
out of a bad dream. A consciousness
is being born, a realization of the
great things men can do when they
act concertedly for a common cause
and a realization of the mischief that
can be caused when they don’t. A
new period of peace and constructive
effort is begging to be born. Let’s
help it along.	.

I wish I were with you-.

God Bless You.

“Tell me, Miss X,” said Mr. Mayer,
cleaning his fingernails with an old
phi Beta Kappa key that happened
to be hanging from an otherwise
empty watch chain on the front of
Mr. Adler; “is it my wit, brain,
beauty, or brawn that causes you to
blush and stammer when Mr. Adler
asks you questions?”

“Well,” said Miss X, blushing and
stammering, “do you want to know
what I think or what Aristotle
thinks?”

Mr. Adler looked hurt and dis-
mayed. “Miss X,” he intervened,
“haven’t you ever read Supibivides’
discourse’on the Thessolonians’ dis-
position to confuse Eros with Aris-
totle?”

“No,” Miss X admitted miserably.

“Don’t you even know who Supibi-
vides is?” Mr. Adler queried, hardly
for information.

Mr. Mayer beetled his brows (this
is not to imply that Mr. Mayer has
beetles in his brows) and poked Mr.
Adler. “Of course she hasn’t read
Supibivides,” he said, disposing of
the entire Educational System with
one sneer; “she hasn’t been com-
pelled to read it yet.”

Mr. Adler turned an approving
eye on his 37-year-old protege, then
turned back to Miss X. “Now Miss
X,” he continued, “whenever I” (he
meant “me”)—“or Mr. Mayer ask
you a question, you may be sure we
want your own thinking.”

“Although,” Mr. Mayer pointed out,
“Mr. Mayer is not averse to your
quoting Aristotle, if you must, or
Adler, to illustrate your thoughts.”

“But to go on—” said Mr. Adler,
laughing heartily to illustrate his
Good Nature; “but to go on with our
original question . . . Miss X, what
was the nature of the original ques-

Miss X opened her mouth, and Mr.
Mayer put in, “Come now, Miss X,

THIRTY POEMS, Thomas Merton
(New Directions; $1)

Merton is a poet who has embraced
the faith of his fathers artistically
as well as spiritually; nonetheless, he
is to be included among the moderns,
belonging to that particular school
which reacts against the involved im-
ages of the leading contemporaries.
He is modern in the sense that his
images stand out now strongly agaist
the rippling pattern of his sounds,
now almost completely submerged.
The effect of the whole poem is that
of a river, a same misty serenity per-
meating both quiescence and turbu-
lence.

In THE MESSENGER, Merton
portrays “some sentry at the rim of
winter. Fed with the speech the wind
makes. In the grand belfries of the
sleepless timber”, a more or less im-
personal intelligence that regards the
conventional damnation of man com-
placently, yet “waits to warn all life
with the tongue of March’s bugle.
Of the coming of the warrior sun.”
This “intelligence” evidences a deep
regard for Nature, which eagerly
awaits the challenge while Man shiv-
ers at the prospect of growth.

“Only!” said Mr. Mayer in the same
gentle manner. “I always thought
that was pretty High Class Society.”

“Well I mean,” added Miss X.

Mr. Adler intervened, hoping some-
how to raise the level of discussion
without raising it to a level of dis-
cussion. “Miss X,” he began, letting
X=O,* “to clarify the point here, what
does Aristotle say are the pleasures
of the animal and those which are
distinctively Human?”

“Or as my old man used to say”,
explained Mr. Mayer, “ ‘What kind of
fun do you get out of talking to all
the women?”

Miss X pulled Aristotle from her
bosom and began to leaf through it
frantically.

How To Grow Volumes From
Pamphlets: The U. of C. Press

From a modest beginning in 1891,
the University of Chicago Press has
expanded to become the largest non-
profit organization of its kind in the
country. Now under the directorship
of Joseph Brandt, the Press publishes
only-non-fictional works.

After an unsuccessful start as a
private corporation, under the direc-
tion of Daniel C. Heath, the Press
became a part of the University in
1894. In 1902 the Press moved into
its present quarters, a building at the
corner of 58th Street and Ellis Avenue
donated by John D. Rockefeller.

During the two years of its private
ownership only five volumes were is-
sued. The next few years, however,
marked the publication of 127 books
and pamphlets, among them Professor
John Dewey’s The School and Society
which is still selling. At this time

Stuff

lightning down the air,
The morning the Mother of God
Loved and dreaded the message of
an angel.”

Of Merton’s life, suffice it to say
that he is under thirty-five years of
age, has been educated here and
abroad, and is at present enrolled in
a Trappist monastery; of his work,
that it is for those who seek escape
from the modern imbroglio and a cer-
tain amount of licking of intellectual
sores and, in this writer’s opinion, it
will not last . . . for all its music.

Black Boy by Richard Wright

For your Don't Miss list this week,
we give you Richard Wright’s auto-
biography, Black Boy. The story of
this colored boy from Mississippi and
his life-long rebellion against racial
prejudice should rouse in its white
readers a blush on behalf of those
of their own race who fight to keep
down a man like Richard Wright.
It’s beautifully written—stern and
realistic in the story of the fight
against actual starvation and the deep
rooted prejudice of the South; simple
and delicate in the story of his dis-
covery of nature and beauty. M. A.

Mr. Adler’s back pocket. Mr. Adler
looked at his watch impatiently, tap-
ped his fingers on the table, and said,
“Well, I’m afraid Mr. Mayer and I

a dinner engagement with the
LSWCPBPAG. But think over this
question during the week.”

He rose, slipped quickly into his
hat and coat, straightened Mr. May-

Miss X looked at the rapidly flee-
ing class, and asked vacantly, “What
is the LSWCPBPAG?”

A passing graduate student glanced
pityingly at Miss X, and explained,
“The Lake Shore Women’s Commit-
tee for the Perpetuation of the
Beauties and Philosophies of An-
cient Greece. It’s sponsored by Mar-
shall Field’s wife’s third cousin’s niece
on her father’s side.”

“Oh,” said Miss X happily.

* X=chi—Xomposite Xo-ed

Dewey’s experimental school here at
the University was attracting the at-
tention of educators throughout the
country.

To commemorate the first ten years
of its existence and the University’s
the Press published 28 volumes in
the greatest series of scientific pub-
lications ever attempted by any in-
stitution. These “Decennial Publica-
tions”, including Jacques Loeb’s Stud-
ies in General Physiology, Dewey’s
Logical Conditions of A Scientific
Treatment of Morality, and Young’s
Scientific Method in Education added
greatly to the prestige of the Press
and of the University. As far as the
Press itself was concerned, the “De-
cennial Publications” were its first
great venture in the field of book pub-
lishing, and both in content and in
typographical format they established
a standard which has influenced its
whole subsequent history.

Diverse fields have been covered by
Press publications. A few of the
many series are the “Oriental Insti-
tute Publications”, works devoted to
the culture and civilization of the
Near East; and departmental series
in the fields of Social Science, Physical
Science and Medicine. In the field of
religion, Edgar J. Goodspeed’s trans-
lation from the original Greek of the
New Testament has had more sales
than any other Press book and is
today the favorite translation of thou-
sands of people because of its vivid,
understandable language.

Establishment of learned periodicals
was urged from the beginning by
President William Rainey Harper;
those published by the Press now
number eighteen.

Co-operative projects with other
presses have also been undertaken.
Largest of these is the Heath-Chicago
Language Series. Begun by a series
of textbooks for teaching French or-
ganized by Dr. Otto Bond of the De-
partment of Romance Languages, it
expanded to include similar series in
German, Spanish, Italian and Latin.
All of the books grew out of experi-
mental work in classes, where they
were tested in mimeographed form
before they were published. Approval
of manuscripts rests with the Board.

Nightly riots have been disturbing the peace and calm of the various
Burton entries, in particular, the 500 entry. It seems politics are subject
of controversy; the other night a most fascinating event occurred. The
chief of the “Fourth Floor Liberals” who is also the president of the first
year of the College was caught on hands and knees by the keyhole of the
room in -which the “Lower Floor Progressives” were holding a supposedly
secret meeting. Our students are beginning to act like Latin-Americans.

Practical Application of Soc.

Another interesting communication was received by the Maroon this
week on the subject of how to avoid the probabilities of fatal spinsterhood.
The document was compiled by a Soc. 2 student who evidently was worried
by approaching old-maidage. The most salient point of the discourse was
that in Sweden a woman married at the age of 26.7—so if you’re 20 you can
go to Sweden and have a career for 6.7 years and then get married (provided,
of course, that you haven’t scared away all the men in that time).

* * *

Gossip

Gerry Mandell’s engagement to an RAF man was just announced. She’s
not planning to be married until after the war—and then she’ll live in Eng-
land.	* * *

Trivia

Marilyn Burkhart sang over the radio Thursday. Beth Carney left for
Washington Sunday to take over her new job as staff assistant on the
American Red Cross. The campus’s most pressing peeve at present is the
removal of the comfortable chairs from the College Library—it seems they’ve
been put in the men’s dorms (the men simply must have their lounge chairs
while the poor commuters sit in suffering). We can’t figure out whose fault
it was—the printer’s or the Sigma Chis’—last week’s Maroon said that the
Sigs had pledged one Louise Basile.

* * *

Weekend Parties

Despite comp blues, social activities filled the campus. W.A.A. had a
square dance Friday night. Pi Delt, Sigma Chi with Phi Sig, Alpha Delt,
and Chi Rho all had mad brawls Saturday night. The last fully lived up to
the glorious old tradition of pre-war parties (lots of men, good music, and
good food) despite the lack of liquor. The little problem was solved by
commuting to the Phi Sig house for beer and bad bourbon (it must have
been bad—next morning one forlorn soul was found sleeping peacefully
under the piano).	* * *

Spring Must be Here

On one of the balmy days, recently, we spotted a daring young lady trying
to climb out a window on the third floor of Ida Noyes—she planned to take
a sun bath out on the roof (which, of course, has been strictly verboten since
last summer when some females, clad only in brevity, yoo-hooed at the sail-
ors). We hear sundry reports that Art Wiesender has been entertaining
females in his room. We don’t know what this has to do with the coming
of spring—but, anyhow, Rod McLeish has acquired a large horse whip.

* * *

Terrorism at Gates

In the wee sma’ hours of the morning about three weeks ago Lois Lowe .
ran screaming down the hall over at Gates. But nobody believed her story
about the creature that had ventured into her room. Finally this week
(when she had toll house cookies again) some of her fellow residents hap-
pened into her. room—and screamed loudly. They too had seen the thing.
“It” is a large insect aptly named T*he Galloping Bug—it gallops about on
its thousand or so legs, wags its mouse-like tail, and generally makes its
four inch self obnoxious.	* * ♦

Nothing in Particular	’

Wednesday morning saw the epitome of frustration—the entire Maroon
staff sitting in the corridors of Lexington Hall, locked out. They tried
climbing in through the windows (which, incidentally, have been washed
for the first time since the building was condemned), called frantically for
Julius, and finally jimmied the lock (yes, the talents of the staff are many
and varied). A tip for the future—the War Stamp Bal! at Int House, April
7, promises to be a big deal.

BIG TEN MEET HERE TOMORROW

Jack Hill

Time In

You might call this week’s col-
umn a fairy tale of sorts. Any-
way, once upon a time, the Uni-
versity of Chicago had a faculty
and administration majority
which actively supported ath-
letics. Yes! Really!

One of our great former presi-
dents, Mr. Harper, made a speech
at the dedication of Bartlett Gym-
nasium. In his speech, Harper re-
marked on the relief he felt at the
installation of the new building. It
was his philosophy that athletics,
physical education, and competitive
play were important parts of a well
rounded education. That’s some-
thing of a different tune from that
which has been heard in recent years
from certain University leaders.
It’s true, a very still and very small
voice has been gaining strength
with many faculty members but as
yet, the voice is in a minority.

The greater Chicago newspapers,
especially the sports sections, love to
pan the University. For some reason
known only to God and/or Bertie
McCormick, we can’t do a damn thing
right. But, we ask the press, and we
ask you—what kind of encouragement
is it for our teams when the oft-quoted
phrase, the end of which reads, “I
lie down until the felling goes away.”,
is echoed in their ears. Can the ath-
letic department or the athletes be
blamed when the President takes the
attitude of sports being a ‘necessary
evil’? Certainly not.

It seems that pink tea parties and
recitals, the well loved of the pseudo-
intellectuals and campus fairies, are
expected to take the place of football,
Big Ten basketball, etc. Perhaps the
omniwise leaders of policy, voiced pol-
icy that is, don’t like sports for Chi-
cago, but it doesn’t look as if the
Army and Navy hold anything against
athletics. Time and time again, men
who really know, men who have not
lived cloistered campus lives, have said
that large scale, well encouraged, com-
petitive sports can play an invaluable
part in military training and in train-
ing citizens for life in the world as
it is today.

This develops into an appeal to
you, the readers, the interested ad-
ministration and faculty members,
and any sports writers of Chicago
for comparison’s sake, the attitude
who chance upon it. Compare, just
of some of the other Western Con-
ference schools as to athletics. They
have well-balanced scholastic pro-
grams and good athletics to boot.

Seemingly, our President and certain
faculty members do not believe the
two to be compatible. A gradual
change is coming over many of the
professors and deans, but this change
has not as yet made itself felt.

Girls’ Swim Team
Loses Officially
To Teacher’s College

Last Wednesday afternoon the Chi-
cago girls’ swimming team faced the
Chicago Teachers College in an of-
ficially scored meet. The time on the
official lanes were telegraphed in to
a central place which was receiving
the results from similar meets all
over the country, and according to
the times, was defeated by the Teach-
ers by three points. However on the
unofficial lanes (judged by eye with-
out a comparison of watches) Chicago
was the winner.



College Basketbailers End
Successful Season With Win

By Bob Schallman

This last week saw the closing of
the 1944-45 basketball season for the
lads of the first two years of the Col-
lege and the presentation of awards
for the season. Those receiving major
letters included co-captains Bill Gray
and Julian Hanson, Chuck Parlin,
Norm Heffron, Lional Eubanks, Jerry
Reaven, Dave Blumberg, and Bob
Schallman. In addition to the eight
major awards, minor letters were
awarded to Matt Jenetupalus, and
Pete Everson.

This past season was perhaps the
most successful in the history of the
lower College. The bucketeers wound
up the season with a record of six
league games won and four dropped,
which put them in the fourth place
berth of the Private School League.
Moreover, for the first time in the
school’s history, this year’s club
weathered the first round of th epost-
season Private School Tourney and
advanced all the way to the play offs
copping the fourth place trophy.
Throughout the regular season the
bucketeers massed a total of ten wins
and eight losses and scored 370 points
to the opposition’s 355.

In the scoring department the
points w^re very evenly divided
among the usual starters, Hanson,
Heffron, Blumberg, Raven, Schall-
man, and Gray. However, Bill Gray
led the scoring barrage and received
deserving laurels. The ability to drop
the sphere through the hoop in ad-
dition to fine floor and defensive play
and brilliane rebounding skill placed
“Large Will” on the All Private
School League Team.

Defaults Mar
Girls9 Games

Complications set in in the Women’s
basketball league last week so that
only about three games were actually
Splayed. The defaulting was fre-
quent, and it was in this manner that
Foster beat Tau Sigma, Gates took
Kelly, Esoteric beat Chi Rho Sigma.
The faithful Studemps were out in
full force however, and they chalked
up some more of their phenomenal
scores: 50-5 over Delta Sigma and
42-15 against XYZ. The eleventh
grade beat Beecher 16-2; Tau Sigma
Upsilon was overcome by the Quads
52-4.

The highlight of the week was the
Basketball Night at Bartlett gym.
W. A. A. beat Foster in a neck and
neck game, and the Quads took Sigma
for the Club Championship for which
they were presented with a trophy,
thus bringing to a close the girls’
season of intramural basketball.

Play-offs Over

Last Tuesday evening a strong, tall
basketball team from Burton 800,
made use of their height to soundly
whip the undefeated Burton 600 men.

The 600 team, which had decisively
beaten their opponents in a league
game less than two weeks before,
seemed lost on the full court of Bart-
lett, but put up a dogged fight, but
the final score stood at 18-4 against
them, and the trophy, a crutch which
was donated by a former student,
came to rest in the 800 Entry.

In the Fraternity - Dormitory
League, the Phi Gams upset the Bur-
ton 300 team in a fast, tight game,
while the Hill’s Entry, Psi U game
was postponed.

Most prominent in the memories of
the players and fans alike and without
a doubt the highpoint of the season
was the trouncing of the league
champions and our perennial rivals
Harvard School for Boys by the lads
in maroon. This was the first victory
over Harvard in the history of the
school and the only defeat suffered by
Harvard throughout the season. The
Harvard game can well be remem-
bered as the finest brand of ball ex-
hibited by this year’s team.

Maroon Riflemen Win
12 Consecutive Meets

Two Chicago rifle teams won
matches from strong out of town op-
position on Monday night at the West
Stands. The Maroon team took their
twelfth straight victory from the
Blackhawk Rifle Club 926 to 916,
while the White riflemen defeated the
Roseland Red tern 871 to 841.

College Thinclads Turn In Best
Season in Six Years-Coach Derr

The College Track team wound up
its best season in six years with a
suprise win over Austin High 43%
to 42%. In this meet, as in the others
during the past year, it was the team
strength combined with the individual
brilliance that was responsible for
the fine showing.

Coach Paul Derr, mentor of this
year’s squad, gave credit “to the boys
for their hard work and cooperation”
in making this “our outstanding
season in my six years of track here
at Chicago.”

The Senior team, captained by
Bob Collins, amassed a grand total of
525.5 points to their opponent’s 243.5
through the year. Most decisive win
was over Mt Carmel 77 to 9 while the
closest shove came last Friday in the
meet with Austin. The Seniors began
the year by knocking off Bowen, and
Sullivan and South Shore following
in quick succession. Then the thinclads
lost their only meet to Schurz 49 to
37 but snapped back to take five
straight over Mt. Carmel, Lakeview,
Harrison, Senn, and Austin.

The Juniors, led by Bob Linsicome,
also won eight of their nine meets,
losing only to Schurz. In the course
of the year they took 368.2 points
while the opponents picked up only
150.8.

During the past season six all time
records were tied and three were
broken. Chuck Grant, Senior speed-
ster now in the Merchant Marines,
tied the 60 yard dash record in :06.7,
and first tied the 440 record, then
broke it with a time of :53.5. Padrick
Burns set a new 660 record of 1:33.0
and the junior relay team, composed
of Lawrence Hershenson, Bob Linsi-

10 Western Conference

Squads Te Visit Chicago .

One of the outstanding sport classics of the Midwest appears
at the University of Chicago fieldhouse tomorrow when every
school in the Western Conference takes in the annual Big Ten
Indoor Track meet. Heavy post-war contenders for the 1945
title are the Michigan Wolverines and the fighting Illini of Illinois.
Other schools in the conference have individual start of brilliance
but Michigan and Illinois have stood head and shoulders over all
the other schools they have competed against this season, both with
well balanced teams.

Site of Big Ten Meet

The University Fieldhouse will be
the home of the Western Conference
Indoor track meet tomorrow.

Haeckner Wins

Left-handed Carl Haeckner placed
as high man in the Sunday handicap
fencing meet at Bartlett. Haeckner,
one of the three south-paw bladesmen
on campus, has recently * returned
from Mexico City where he competed
with Latin fencers on and off for
several years.

Max Gelman placing second, tri-
umphed over Bob Wiley of Senn High,
who came in third. Twenty AFLA
members participated in the meet.

come, Richard Daskais and Bob
Ascher, broke the old record three
times in the year, finally whittling
the time down to :48.3 seconds for
the 440 yard course. Jack Kendall
twice tied the all time Senior 50 yard
low hurdle record of :07.5 and Bob
Linsicome five times tied the Junior
low hurdle record of :07.9. Jack Dona-
hue tied the Junior pole vault record
at 10 and the Senior 880 yard relay
team of Don Johnson, Jack Kendall,
Bob Collins and Chuck Grant tied the
record at 1:37.8.

Other outstanding performances
were contributed by Bob Collins, who
took 86 points in the hurdles; Bren-
ton Stearns, who took eight consecu-
tive first places in the half mile;
Chuck Ferris, who won the pole vault
in every meet; Dave Hall, who took
32 points in the 440 dash; Alvo Mar-
tin and Frank Mangin, milers; John
Davies in the shot put; and the Bush-
nells and Dave Weaver in the high
jump.

Among the standouts on the Junior
team were Bob Linsicome in shot
put, dashes, hurdles, high jump and
relay; Jack Donahue, who was unde-
feated at the pole vault; Bob Ascher,
sprinter extraodninaire; and Padrick
Burns, who placed in every 660 that
he ran.

Despite the fine indoor showing,
Derr is not too optimistic about the
outdoor prospects. The teams have
been hard hit by the loss of Bob
Ascher, Padrick Burns and Jack
Donahue who are out for baseball;
Chuck Grant, serving in the Merchant
Marine; and Don Johnson, who may
be out with an injured hip.

Illinois holds a slight edge with
a victory over Michigan last Satur-
day but the Illini win was one of
individual performances and the well
balanced Wolverine machine may
wear down the Orange and Blue
thinclads by shear weight of num-
bers. With Bob Kelley, ‘Buzz’ Bus-
ter on one hand, the famous Hume
twins on the other, it would be
difficult to name a really strong
favorite.

v Few Chicago Entries

Coach Ned Merriam, veteran track
coach, is allowing any boy on the
Maroon squad to enter the qualifica-
tion trials but there is little doubt
that any such entries will be for
experience alone.

The Wolverines start dead-heat two
milers who run the long grind in
around 9:50. Friedlander has had
trouble in running the same distance
under 10:50. In the mile, Michigan
has 4 men, all running the distance in
under 4:30. Friedlander rarely travels
faster than 5:00 flat.

Turtelotte, Russell May Run

Turtelotte and Russell, in the
broad jump and dashes for the for
mer and the hurdles for the latter,
may also compete but Turtelotte
would have to add a good foot to
his best present jump to make a
dent in the standings and Russell
goes up against some powerful high
board men who have bettered his
time by almost 1% seconds in the
steeple chase.

The qualifying events lead off at
1:20 at the Fieldhouse. Regular ad-
mission for the afternoon session is
60 cents, 25 cents for students, while

the evening show beginning at
requires $1.50 regular fee or 50
for students. *

Bookstore To

6:15,
cents

12th,

Beginning

Monday^ March

The Bookstore is making another
change in its cigarette distribution
plan. Instead of numbered slips being
handed out, a colored ticket will be
used, and there will be a different
color for each day of the week.

The front of the ticket states that
it entitles the bearer to purchase a
package of cigarettes at the Uni-
versity of Chicago Bookstore on the
day printed at the bottom.

The back of the ticket explains that
the Bookstore is attempting to serve
its customers with a package every
other day. This means that if you go

in Monday for a ticket, you will get
one which entitles you to purchase a
package on Tuesday. Then on Tues-
day, you are not to ask for another
ticket. You wait until Wednesday and
then you will get one for a purchase
on Thursday. In other words you are
not to ask for a ticket if you have one
in your possession.

Ticket distribution starts at 12:20
each day and cigarettes go on sale at
12:30. Under this new plan it will





not be necessary to line up a accord-
ing to number and the first persons
in line will be the first to be waited on.
