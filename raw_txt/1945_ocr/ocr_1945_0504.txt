Season; Comic
Hit Tops Card

By BETTY STEARNS

“The Philadelphia Story”, one of
Philip Barry’s more outstanding box-
office successes, should also prove to
be an effective drawing card for the
Office of Dramatic Productions, when
it is presented in Mandel Hall to-
night and tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m.

Not since the production of “Clau-
dia”, last year, has O.D.P. given cam-
pus audiences any strictly contempor-
ary humor. Merle Sloan who played
Claudia at that time, returns in the
role of the socialite, Tracy Lord. A
veteran University actress, she has
also appeared in “Heaven Can Wait”,
“Letters to Lucerne”, and more re-
cently, “Kind Lady”. Mary Diamond,
who has given fine performances in
“Pygmalion”, “Night Must Fall”, and
‘Hedda Gabler” will handle the flash
bulb this time, as the reporter from
Destiny magazine. A nosy gentleman,
to be played by Bill Flory, will help
Miss Diamond pry odds and ends out
of Jean Cooke, Helen Auerbach, Rob-
ert Voas and Roy Pakensky, who con-
stitute, at present reckoning, the ir-
regular Lord family. Others following
their respective inclinations in the cast
are Sid Levy, Alan Boulton, and Rob-
ert Brooks.

Mostly known for his sophisticated
comedies like “Holiday” and “The An-
imal Kingdom” Mr. Barry also has
mystic leanings, which turned up in
“Hotel Universe” and “Here Come the
Clowns”. “Without Love” was his
contribution to 1942, a confused thing,
which owed what little popularity it
had to Constance Bennett and her
wardrobe. Judging from New York
reviews, Tallulah Bankhead is playing
Atlas for his current piece, “Foolish
Notion”.

However, “Philadelphia Story” for
all its dubious surroundings, remains
a very bright spot in Mr. Barry’s

New Health Service Head
Sought; Reed Will Retire

Disclosure that he will soon be considered for retirement
under the University’s age limit of 65, flashed the spotlight this
week on Dr. Dudley Billings Reed, Director of Student Health
Service. His retirement will terminate a period of over 33 years

service to the University.

Reed has informed administrative
officials of his planned retirement and
a search for a successor is now under
way, The Chicago Maroon has learned
from authoritative sources.

As director of the health service,
Dr. Reed is in charge of a medical
project with a quarterly budget in
excess of $15,000. Despite reduced
wartime enrollment, $45,000 was al-

lor, and several part-time doctors.

Beginning this summer, the quar-
terly health fee of $3 per student,
which has financed Student Health
in the past, will be discontinued, and
the Health Service will receive an
allocation from general University

Conduct Final
Music Program

By SAMUEL GOLDEN

Wednesday evening, May 9, at 8:30
p.m. a free concert will be given
in Mandel Hall by the University of
Chicago Chamber Orchestra. The pro-
gram will include the following num-
bers: Haydn, Andante and Menuetto
from the Symphony No. 6 (Surprise);
Bach-Abert, Prelude Chorale and Fu-
gue; Gretry, Six Dances from La
Rosiere Republicaine; Johanne Chris-
tian Bach, Concerto for piano and or-
chestra ; Beethoven, Three Equales
for Four Trombones.

The piano concerto promises to be
of interest. Perry O’Neill, who was
heard earlier this year in the Villa-
Lobos program, will be soloist in this
work. The concerto is a delicate and
very appealing piece of music. Accord-
ing to Hans Lange, who will again
conduct the orchestra, “All of his life
Mozart called Christian Bach the
greatest of composers. And you can
tell the influence the earlier composer
had over him, for this composition
is in the style of Mozart, but only
in its orchestration a little more
primitive.” O’Neill’s adequate tech-

Sunday’s concert will feature mu-

jazz circles as “Chicago style.”

The seven piece combination is
composed of men outstanding in their
field. Bud Jacobson was named in

Hayek Living In DoubtersCastle
Says Merriam In Maroon Article

No book in recent times has stirred more heated controversy nor
more choleric comments from political scholars than Fredrich Hayek’s
“The Road to Serfdom.”

Last week Hayek, touring America, carried his thesis that a planned
economy will lead to Fascism onto the Quadrangles.

The Chicago Maroon has invited Charles E. Merri-
am, distinguished American political scientist, and pro-
fessor emeritus with the University, to comment on
Hayek’s assertions. Prof. Merriam’s article, written
exclusively for. The Maroon, is published on Page 2

Hits 'Doubting Thomases’ Who
Fear Evolution ofNewDemocracy

(WRITTEN EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE CHICAGO MAROON)

I have been asked by The Chicago Maroon to comment on
Dr. Hayek’s Road to Serfdom, a book I reviewed in the November
number of the American Journal of Sociology.

Dr. Hayek’s volume is introduced
to his readers as “a political book.”
As a student of politics and govern-
ment, I make the following comments.
1. The writer persistently ignores
planning as carried on by many Amer-
icans and British who have for years
conducted extensive systems of plan-
ning, local, state, regional and nation-
al, public and private. The American
Society of Planning Officials located
across the street from the University
of Chicago at 1313 East 60th Street
and the National Planning Associa-
tion in Washington (a private organ-
ization) are excellent examples. Nor
does the writer come to grips with the
notable plans presented in England
by Sir William Beveridge or the bril-
liant projects of the Political and
Economic Planning group.

2.	The writer shows only a very in-
adequate knowledge or understanding

of administration and management as
tools of government, seeming to iden-
tify them with arbitrary decision, as
against the “rule of law” he vaguely
discusses.

3.	The writer seems distrustful of
democratic controls in the develop-
ment of modern society. “Why the
Worst Get on Top” is the title of one
of his chapters.

4.	Attrbuting Naziism to German
liberalism or German social democracy
is a wholly untenable interpretation of
recent history. I heard Hitler say
that he was to save the world from
Bolchevism and his main attacks were
made upon all ofrms of socialism.

5.	Dr. Hayek’s Road to Serfdom
echoes Herbert Spencer’s Coming
Slavery a half century ago. They
both look backward rather than for-
ward.

The truth is that we are on the

fund maintained by the club alumnae.

high road to human freedom. W<
have overthrown the international
gangsters who hid behind Fascism and
Naziism, and we are about to outlaw
war and unemployment. The Spencer-
Hayek-Mises arguments confuse rath-
er than clarify the issues of our time,
present doubts and fears rather than
reason, courage, and faith.

Never were the prospects for human
freedom as bright, never were serf-
dom and slavery so discredited as
in this hour of human emancipa-
tion. Nothing can stay the sweep of
democracy and liberty in the genera-
tion that stretches before us. The
timid souls who view only with alarm
the evolution of modern democracy,
with its plans for an expanding econ-
omy, for a fair share of the gains of
civilization, for lasting peace with its
plans for richer and finer freedom!—
these jittery persons will be left be-
hind in Doubting Castle, where they
feel at home.

reading of a series of books which
reflect the fundamental trends in
thought and action during the last
two centuries. These readings will

economy, representative government,
and the conflict between science and
religion—three of the outstanding
problems of fairly modern times.

HUTCHINS WILL SPEAK AT
NO-DRAFT RALLY MAY 16

The anti-post war military conscription campaign was revived on campus
yesterday with disclosure that President Hutchins will be featured speaker
of a giant rally May 16 at Mandel Hall.

The Student Political Action Committee, a branch of Labor Rights, will
sponsor the meeting. Details are currently being completed.

Hutchins was one of 12 prominent educators who several months ago
sent a letter to the late President Roosevelt, opposing measures in Congress
calling for conscriptions after the war.

Meantime, Labor Rights announced that its three-point program, reached
at the conclusion of its two day race relations conference, will be converted
into action. A program including education, legislation, and individual action
was urged at the conclusion of the conference. Five hundred persons heard
Aubrey Williams, well known liberal, plead for unity and tolerance at Mandel
Hall Saturday night. Panels on the “anti-discrimination” problem held the
following day also attracted large audiences.

criticism of all the arts. It will
cater to no school, political or aes-
thetic, but will be open to all. “If
necessary,” he added, “the quality
will be maintained by contribu*
tions from outside the University
itself.”

resent the students, and Rabbi Mau-
rice B. Pekarsky, Director of the
Hillel Foundations at the University
of Chicago and Northwestern Uni-
versity will welcome the guests. He-
brew melodies by Cantor Moses J.
Silverman of Anshe Emet Congrega-
tion will be another highlight of the
program.

The house is a three-story building
with facilities for student use includ-
ing a library, music room, lounge,
recreation hall, dining room, kitchen,
administrative offices, a chapel for
Sabbath and special services, and
rooms for study and discussion. The
February Purim Festival of the Foun-
dation was held there. In addition,
the semimonthly Fireside, and Rab-
bi Pekarsky’s weekly study group
for the discussion of Jewish problems
are important activities in the house.

The Hillel Foundation at the Uni-
versity has for many years had an
office in Rockefeller Memorial Chapel.
Although it now functions in its own
home, Hillel will maintain, as in the
past, a close relationship with the
chapel and the various student reli-
gious groups connected with it.

The building was furnished by the
Women of B’nai B’rith of District
Six under the supervision of Mrs.
Benjamin Sherman, chairman of the
Hillel committee of the district, with
the assistance of Mrs. Harry Zim-
merman. Special equipment has been
provided by the lodges of the Chi-
cago B’nai B’rith Council, Mr. Fred
Mann, president, and Mr. Jacob M.
Shapiro, chairman of the Council’s
Hillel Committee, in charge. The ac-

Editorial

Zero Hour For Student Health

The University of Chicago was a young
educational oasis in the desert when Dr. Dudley
Billings Reed became a member of the faculty.
For thirty-three years the Director of Student
Health has served the University faithfully and
honestly. The welfare of the student has always
been a cardinal plank in his program.

His scheduled retirement in the near future
affords the University an opportunity to re-
examine student health and to frame blueprints
for an organization capable of safeguarding the
well being of a moderate sized community. It
at once presents both the administration and the
student body with a challenge.

Distorted Mythology

Few branches of the University in recent
years have been subjected to a heavier bombard-
ment of criticism and protest than the Health
Bureau. Some of it may well be justified. But
entirely too many tales have lacked factual sub-
stantiation and are the figment of highly lurid
and imaginative minds. A distorted and badly
confused legend has been a bigger enemy to
student health than its alleged lack of facilities
or proper care.

In any event it is certainly high time that
some action be taken. It is no longer a secret to
report that an extensive and far reaching in-
vestigation has been under way for some weeks.
Medical centers at other Universities have been
studied. The University is well aware that it is
shouldered with a tremendous responsibility, and
as such it is preparing to reorganize this branch
of the institution.

There are two salient steps to be taken in
moving up the ladder to a more adequate student
health program. First, the selection of a new
director should be made only after extreme care
has been taken and a thorough investigation has
been made. Not only is it necessary that we have
a physician of high repute, but it is also of vital

importance that he be an excellent administrator
and that above all he be made to realize that
student health is at all times a service to the
student body. A minimum of red tape and a
maximum of prompt attention appears to be in
order.

Students Have Duty Too

Of equal significance, is the necessity for
putting a clamp on the rumor foundry which has
ground out so many nefarious stories. Students
of the University must prepare to offer the new
director an opportunity to demonstrate that his
program Hills the void which is so apparent.
Student health is on trial. But the jurors must
be tolerant, open minded, lacking in bias. It is
incumbent upon every student of the University
to assume a joint responsibility with the ad-
ministration—that of suggestion for improve-
ment. It is not enough to assert that a serious and
highly lamentable condition exists; it is not
enough to ride along on pet gripes and unsub-
stantiated rumors. Concrete suggestions for
improvement are in demand. As such the col-
umns of this newspaper are open to recommenda-
tions from the entire student body.

The first few planks in the new program are
simple and self evident. There is a necessity
for closer liason between Billing Hopital, the
medical school, and the health service. Some of
the most eminent men in the medical profession
are members of the Billings staff. As such their
services should be available to us all, for the first
obligation of this University must always be in
the welfare of its students.

It is further necessary that the new director
impress the Medical School and Billings that
student health is not a giant laboratory. We are
not guinea pigs. This does not reject statistical
studies or research, but it reiterates the para-
mount purpose of student health: Service.

Student Health’s day of decision is at hand.

Minneapolis, May 3—(ACP)—
American University students oppose
continuance of accelerated programs
after the war, according to results of
a nationwide survey conducted by
the American College Publicity As-
sociation which was released today.

Of the 4,000 students polled, 67
per cent opposed continuance of the
accelerated programs, 80 per cent
were against “concentrated” study
programs, and 82 per cent would
continue the same courses they now
carry were the war to end abruptly.

The poll included a cross-Section
of University students.

Louisiana State University, May 3
—(ACP)—The battle of the jeans
reached here today and the campus
newspaper, The Reveille, had this to
say about it:

The biggest clothes mania which
has hit college campuses since the
coming of the saddle shoe is the blue
jean, signs of which have become
more prevalent by the day on the
L.S.U. campus. Men may groan and
faculty moan but, on thick or thin,
the blue jean carries on.

Clerks in men’s stores have long
ago resigned themselves to the dim-
inutive and very feminine coed who
asks for “Boys blue jeans, please,
smallest size.”

Size, though, is really irrelevant.
Though designers and fashion experts
have tried admirably and long to
popularize fitted clothes among co-
eds, the Sloppy Joe sweater, old-

Innuendoes by Armstrong

“Now Aristotle Would State That.. ”

Letters to Editor

I fashioned nightshirt, and bright plaid
shirts have proved, rather conclusive-
ly, that the gals like their relaxing
duds roomy—enough for a moderate
sized tractor. Therefore it matters
not that a 32-inch waistline is gath-
ered in to enclose a 24-inch waist,
and, illogically enough, that 36-inch
hips are squeezed into the 35-inch
measurement of the boys’ jeans.

There is little variety in the strict
code of the “jeaners.” They wear
them always with one leg rolled, one
down, a leather belt, preferable fancy,
and saddle shoes or moccasins. Draped
like a graceful tow sack, the volum-
inous checkered or plaid shirt tops
off this ensemble on chilly days.

We have yet to see the cooler de-
velopment in shirts brought by the
coming summer, or even whether the
fad will brave the unabating storm
of masculine opposition and the Ba-
ton Rouge heat waves, but for the
present—‘chick, ain’t we?’-

New Assignment of

She Had Case of Parotitis
But Medics Didn't Know It

To the Editor,

One day last week, with severe doubts as to my wisdom, I
walked timidly into Billings, and asked for a diagnosis. I thought
I had the mumps. The doctor looked at me with his desk lamp,
took my temperature and announced that, as far as he could tell, I
did not have the mumps. I was reassured, but remembered after-
wards that the learned gentleman told me neither what the irrita-
tion might be, nor what I should do. I did, as the story always goes,
come down with mumps, exposing, after my interview, at least
fifteen unsuspecting people.

I could go on being bitter by telling of my past experiences with student
health. There is no point in that, and besides, it is too near Comprehensives
to have such lugubrious humor pushed in anyone’s ear.

Sometime, however, Billings might find it edifying to take a poll and see
exactly what the current opinions are about the available service. With
such a compact course of study as is presented to us, the moderately intelligent
student can’t afford to be sick. Not even the most wealthy among us can
afford to pay a health fee of $9 a year for inadequate, inefficient, and
dangerous attention in return. But it is not just my tales of woe, or those
of my friends. The whole campus is alive with indignation and disgust
One wonders when the authorities, who ever they may be, will recognize
this long standing joker.

Thank goodness I live off campus, and have other doctors whom I can
consult. I feel sorry for those out of town students who have no other
Chicago connections. As far as I am concerned, a trip to Billings is a
well paved road to disaster.

In hopes that this may form a policy, I remain,

B. J. S.

Her Realism ‘Unreal’, He Says

To the Editor:

At the present time there is a tendency to adopt a “realistic” point of
view on foreign policy questions. This tendency is unfortunately limited by
many, amongst them Miss Lurie, author of one of last week’s letters in this
column. Their realism stops just short of the plans for the future, the nature
of the peace. According to Miss Lurie, when we discuss the domestic policies
of President Truman and the San Francisco Conference, we are to have
“Faith”. I presume that when we discuss Darlanism, the Curzon Line, and
the Greeks killed in Athens by Allied bullets, we must be realistic. We
might say of these Greeks killed in Athens that they had attained Miss Lurie’s
“lasting peace—through the cooperation of the leading powers involved”, but
we should be somewhat suspicious of the justice of that action, not “cautious”,
“suspicious”.

That was the British in Greece, though. Roosevelt was different. All
very well, but: “The (Roosevelt) Administration has made many protesta-
tions of noble aims in foreign policy, but when the moment came to act on
them it has hesitated and compromised. Its foreign policy has not been to
support the American principles of Freedom. It has dealt with fascist ele-
ments in conquered countries, it has disregarded the will of the people in
these countries;—. It has been canny and personal and subjective. It has
called this policy expediency. But since the policy has produced little but
dislike, distrust and loss of prestige for the United States without achieving
the intended poitical aims, it has not even been expedient.” These words
were not the words of some revolutionist hiding behind a copy of Capital,
nor of the Chicago Tribune. These are the words of the late Wendell Wilkie,
who was one of the leading exponents of American Liberalism. They are the
expression of his “disappointment” after the national conventions of last year.

That, however, was in 1944. The San Francisco Conference is in 1945.

B & G Head Plagued
By Dozen Headaches

By PAT KINDAHL

The Department of Buildings and Grounds, long known on
campus as the “B. and G.”, is never more appreciated than at this
time of the year. They are solely responsible for the beauty of
the campus, and incidentally, for blocking off your favorite paths
with those perennial wire fences.

Judy Downt

With the coming of warm weather,
the department began its annual
spring house-cleaning. Under the di-
rection of Lyman R. Flook, Superinten-
dent of Buildings and Grounds, and
Head Landscape Gardener Carl F.
Mack, the men employed on the
grounds lifted their rakes out of cam-
phor and began cleaning up the lit-
ter of winter. This spring activity,
now in progress, includes the seeding
of approximately 100 acres of the
University ground. About 3000 lbs. of
grass seed will be sown this year.

Because the soil is not too rich, any
tramping across the new grass is
injurious. The department set out
five “Please” signs, but apparently
they had little effect, since four were
stolen, and students continue to tra-
vel their old paths.

Keeping up the appearance of the
campus is no part-time job. With al-
most 25 blocks to cover, even the or-
dinary tasks of sprinkling and mow-
ing the grass take a little time. B & G
now shares a motor-driven mowing
machine with the athletic department
three days a week, but they’d ra-
ther not think about what will hap-
pen when that breaks down.

Trimming and pruning the trees
and shrubs, anti-insect spraying, and
replacing shrubs are the not-so-ob-

vious, but nevertheless, important,
duties of the department.

One of the major headaches of the
B & G is the constant littering of the
campus with newspapers, candy wrap-
pers, crumpled cigarette wrappers,
and loose paper of all kinds—par-
ticularly in front of the University
Bookstore.

To supply replacements for shrubs
and various plants as needed and to
experiment with new plants before
placing them out on the campus,
Buildings and Grounds maintains its
own greenhouse in the area of Barnes
Laboratory, and a nursery of about
an acre on Cottage Grove Ave., near
57th St. The Department also has
about three acres in a nursery al-
most thirty miles west of the Uni-
versity.

B. & G. launched a general pro-
gram of improvement in 1930. That
program continued through the de-
pression, and has only slowed down
during the past two years because
of the labor shortage. Mrs. Beatrix
Farrand, Consulting Landscape Gar-
dener, has lent invaluable aid in for-
mulating and carrying out that pro-
gram, which has included the plant-
ing of trees wherever needed, the
training of vines on the buildings in

Servin' it Hot

At Burton Court Sunday afternoon
at 2:00 the University of Chicago will
have the privilege of discovering first
hand what this thing called jazz is
all about. Bud Jacobson will lead a
seven piece jam combination, com-
posed of the city’s outstanding jazz
artists, through three hours of free
and spontaneous jazz. It will hear
the music that made Chicago famous
in jazz history authentically played
by men who were a vital part of
that fabulous era which produced the
‘Chicago style”.

This is the band that thrilled Chi-
cago jazz enthusiasts at the second
►f Phil Featheringill’s recent jam ses-
sions at the Zanzibar. Personnel will
nclude Bud Jacobson on clarinet;
Fohnny Mendle on trumpet; Warren
Smith on trombone; Volley De Faut
•n clarinet and tenor; Jack Goss on
guitar; Tut Soper on piano; and Lou
pinnerty on drums.

Next Sunday will mark the first
zd concert presented on the U. of C.
mpus since Natty Dominique and
►hnny Dodds appeared at Mandel
all in 1939. We have talked of anc
ished for such an event with increas-
g fervor for a long time, but it took
inny Gerald of Judson Court to
lietly push the deal through. Danny,
serious jazz collector from Boston

May Day

As we walked across the Midway Tuesday evening we saw
a gaily decorated May Pole (orange and green streamers!) stand-
ing desertedly across from the girls’ dormitories. Upon it was
tacked a sign, “Please do not disturb—we’re having a May Pole
dance at 6:30.” Our operators have been unable to find who the
dancers were, but we hail the revival of childhood customs.
Speaking of childhood customs, several of our friends were out
hanging May baskets on people’s doors. The most unusual basket
was one filled with a few handfuls of peanuts.

Burlesque, No Less

Sleepy Blake Hall residents poked their curler-decorated heads out the
windows the other night to find a large group of ASTP’s in front. Sweetly,
the Army men began to sing; entranced, the girls listened as the strains
of the Strip Polka lilted forth. From the group stepped out a stalwart
youth, clad in pillowcases and various unmentionables. As the women
applauded vociferously, he daintily began to remove the garments and finally
disclosed the usual olive-drab uniform. When he refused to proceed further,
the windows were closed and Blake returned to its usual state of rigor mortis.

Our High IQ

At the gymnastics meet last Saturday, one of our sweet young things
tried to sell a program for the meet (“It tells you everything you want
to know.”) to none other than Kyle Anderson. . . . Then too, a few University
women were tearing happily down University the other night, barking,
meowing, mooing, cackling, and otherwise working off their spring fever.
A bewildered B&G man came out of a building to see what the disturbance '
was and as the situation dawned on him, he smiled happily and barked
right back. ... To top the week off, a high-minded young lady began to study
on the bus; the wolf-minded gentleman sitting next to her hastily withdrew
his attentions when he saw the title of the chapter she was reading—
Conduct and Morals.

One of the finest collections of con-
temporary American paintings ever as-
sembled is currently being shown in the
east wing galleries of the Chicago Art
Institute by the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
an adjunct of the University.

A full month’s exhibit will be completed
May 13 after which the 121 paintings
which comprise the collection will be sent
on a series of exhibitions that will cover
most of the country and may last as long
as five years, according to E. H. Powell,
president of Britannica.

While several of the works are mediocre, the
collection, most critics agree, is one of the finest
of its kind ever assembled. It is comprehensive
and includes American art from the turn of
the century to the present day.

The Britannica is owned by the University.
Members of the University art department have
been closely associated with the exhibit.

All phases of contempbrary American life are
represented. Starting with the famous “Eight”
of whom six—Henri, Sloan, Luks, Glackens, Shinn
and Davies—are included, the exhibition continues
with works by most of the best known American
artists of today.

Conservatives and moderns, primitives and
abstractionists are combined to present a full cross
section of contemporary American painting.

The names of the artists cover a wide range.
Among them are Abraham Rattner, Francis Criss,
Stuart Davis, Max Weber, Ralston Crawford, John
Caroll and Philip Evergood. Chicagoans repre-
sented include Copeland Burg, Aaron Bohrod, Wil-
liam Schwartz and Francis Chapin, whose “Break-
fast on the Porch” is one of the most recent
additions to the collection.

Other recent additions are “Cars in Sleet
Storm” by Arthur Dove; “Jak Bone and Fungus”
by Georgia O’Keefe and “Marin Island—Small
Point, Maine” by John Marin. Marin’s painting,
a water color, is an especially fine one.

Genealogy, Dept, of

Our favorite English teacher (Mr. Stevenson, to the uninitiated) diverged
again from the subject last week to enlarge upon the descendants of Robert
Louis Stevenson; we believe the point of the discussion was to prove that
Mr. Stevenson is a seventh cousin of RLS. In a way, it reminded us of the
time Mr. Stevenson spent two class hours upon a dissertation of the genealogy
of the kings of England (to whom, we gather, he is not related).

Social Bits

Green Hall’s open house Sunday will be highlighted with the serving

at Gardiner and Vaughn Hospitals are probably the most popular persons

THE REPUBLICANS’ HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES
Chapter XVIII

The era we are now considering was highlighted by laws out-
awing various things. Prominent among these were the Pure
Food and Drug Act, outlawing impure foods and drugs^ the Inter-
state Commerce Act, outlawing interstate commerce, the Elkins

Act, outlawing Elkins, etc.

Also prominent was the conflict
over the tariff. The pretexts used by
the tariff advocates (pretexionists)
were that the tariff:

1.	Raised the level of employment.

2.	Promoted domestic prosperity.

3.	Protected the common man.

Their opponents, the free traders,
denounced these aims, maintaining
;hat elimination of the tariff would:

1.	Protect the common man.

2.	Promote domestic prosperity.

3.	Raise the level of employment.

The controversy raging about these
conflicting ideas flamed for years
until it was finally suppressed, there-
by becoming America’s most famous
mute question.

Prominent in this and other ques-
tions was the silver tongued and sil-

ver minded orator, William Jennings
Bryan. Mr Bryan’s silver policy was
opposed by temperance elements, who
confused 16 to 1 with 33 to 1. He
was so badly disillusioned by this that
he ceased his battles against gold,
the tariff, etc., to sally forth against
his other great enemy of American
life, evolution. He gained undying
fame in this crusade by going to Ten-
nessee to prosecute a monkey.

This . was brought to a close by the
Spanish American War, over which
we will pass briefly. This is un-
doubtedly the least important war in
A. H- It caused so little interest in
the United States that even its iden-
tity was occasionally forgotten, caus-
ing the government to launch the slo-
gan “Remember the Name.”

To the Editor:

Your article on the C.A.A.U. gymnastics, meet is excellent from the
standpoint of writing, but in the matter of information it leaves much'
to be desired.

In the first place, Lindblom High School, not Senn, was the champion
by over one hundred points. In addition to this, you omitted all mention of
the performance of Irvin Bedard who is National A.A.U. Tumbling Champion
and one of the very few men ever to perform what is known as a two-and-
one-half-twist layout.	»

Your predictions and information concerning the April 28 meet are fine,
but if you had taken the time to read the posters on campus you would
have seen that the meet is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., not 2:00 p.m. You also
neglected to mention that the meet is to include events for girls, and that,
as an added attraction, Irvin Bedard will perform his National A.A.U.
championship exercise.

Why don’t you send a reporter to the meets before writing them up ? It
would also help if your information as to forthcoming events were more
complete.

Hoping that you will take this criticism in the spirit in which it is of
fered, we are,

Emphasis during this year’s sum-

be on problems of returning service
personnel and postwar tasks facing the
nation’s teachers, pastors, and school
administrators.

Plans have been completed for one
of the busiest summer quarters since
the University initiated summer work
for American institutions fifty years
ago.

Certifiable units of instruction are
being offered for as short a period as
three weeks each of the two six-week
terms of the summer quarter.

New tuition rates will be effective
for the coming quarter, with the basic
fee 10 percent above that of previous
years.

All levels of education will be rep-
resented, with returned service per-
sonnel and other teachers preparing
or re-training to teach special courses,
students under the old undergraduate
plan completing their studies, and a
new class of students working under
the College Plan.

In addition to courses in the divi-
sions of the University, the College,
and the professional schools, the pro-
| gram will include workshops in nurs-
ing education, library science, art,
home economics, social service admin
istration, forthcoming developments
in American education and personnel
guidance, and institutes and confer-
ences for teachers, clergymen, social
scientists and administrators.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Friday, May 4, 1945 ———

Jack Hill

Time In

Last week’s editorial by Abe
Krash, Maroon editor and our
immediate boss, should afford us
material for weeks to come.
There is nothing we would rather
do than argue the case for ath-
letics at the University of Chi-
cago. In fact, since Saturday
about all we’ve been doing is
talking about the general view-
point of the student on campus
in connection with athletics.

Mr. Krash had some very good
points in his composition. We whole-
heartedly agree with him when he
says that it is the job of those who
are interested in sports to sell sports.
But when Mr. Krash says that the
President has nothing against ath-
letics and that the administration
made their stand “crystal clear,” we
are forced to take issue with him.

Again when the editorial states
that there is a necessity to demon-
strate that a full and well rounded
sports program is an integral part
of a college curriculum, we are hard
put to demonstrate such a necessity.
It has always been our opinion that
even the administration has at least
partially agreed on the need for phy-
sical education. Without health, and
health goes hand in hand with phy-
sical education, even the most bril-
liant student will have difficulty
maintaining the constant pressure so
necessary in the college curriculum
of today. Without a healthy body,
how can any earnest man or woman
hope to accomplish whatever goals he
sets for himself?

If Mr. Krash had taken a little
more time to study our recent at-
tempts, he might have noted that at
no time have we asked for a “grid-
iron with classrooms attached there-
to.” Nor have we ever asked for sub-
sidization or proletyzation. In fact,
this column has never asked for the
return of inter-collegiate football.
We have tried to bring home the fact
that the ‘cold-shoulder’ which Presi-
dent Hutchins and many of the fac-
ulty have given athletics has almost
proved its death blow.

There, in one sentence, is what to
us, is the only logical explanation for
the poor showings Chicago has made
in recent years. If Mr. Hutchins, or
Dean Maclean, or Dean Faust, or
Dean Kimpton would unbend enough
to admit that physical education can
help make a better student, there
might be a slight chance that Chicago
could somehow pull out of its pres-
ent athletic doldrums.

We’d like to hear from both sides
of the fence on this question. It is
time that this situation be brought
out into the open and examined by
all concerned. Either a positive or
negative statement from any of the
Deans or the President would be wel-
come. With such a statement, Chi-
cago would know whether to proceed
with everything possible, or whether
University athletics should give up
the ghost quietly.

3 Intramural Softball
Leagues Scheduled

Opening its 1945 season, intra-
mural softball at the University of
Chicago will get under way as soon
as the weather permits. Teams are
scheduled to participate in three
leagues.

The College League will be made
up of two year dorms and commuters.
There will be a separate league for
the upper years of the college and
university, with the exception of the
med students, who will again play in
their own circuit. Individual medals
will be given in each loop.

LAST: MAROONS WIN, 12-9

Trackmen at
Milwaukee In
3-Way Tussle

On the road for the third consec-
utive week, the University of Chicago
track team will travel to Milwaukee
Saturday for a return meet with Mil-
waukee State Teachers and Elmhurst
College. .Chicago holds a 20 point
win over Elmhurst while the Teacher’s
college won last wek’s triangular meet
with DeKalb at DeKalb.

The Maroons won five first places
and tied for an additional two but a
lack of depth proved too much for
Coach Ned Merriam’s thinclads. The
final score was 67% points for Mil-
waukee, 45*4 points for DeKalb and
34 points for the University.

Rangy Paul Russell, track captain,
won the high and low hurdle events
and leaped 20 feet for the first in
the broad jump. John Bokman, cross-
country ace, won the mile and half
mile and went on to tie for third in
the pole vault. Earl Dinklelocker tied
for first in the 100 yard dash and
ran the anchor leg in the relay.

Call Sounded For
Soccer Hopefuls

Spring soccer practice for all
. University men will begin this
afternoon on the newly constructed
soccer field at the west end of
Stagg Field. Coach Alver Herman-
son will coach players on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday from 4-5
p.m.

funds. The present services offered
free of additional charge to students,
will presumably be continued under
the new setup and include a health ex-
amination for every entering student,
treatment of ambulatory cases during
Health Service office hours, and emer-
gency treatment at Billings when the
Health Service is closed. One Week’s
hospitalization is provided for any
illness necesitating it, as well as
medical attention during hospitaliza-
tion, any ordinary laboratory tests,
chest X-rays recommended by the
staff, and operating room fees when
emergency operations are required.
For a small fee, staff physicians will
call on students in the University dis-
trict who are too ill to come to the
Health Service office in Billings.

Although the health service is not
administratively connected with either
Billings Hospital or the University
medical school, Dr. Reed, who was
educated at Oberlin College and at
Columbia University, holds an ap-
pointment as Professor of Hygiene
in the Medical School and can avail
himself of various specialists at the
hospital for consultation when neces-
sary. In addition students hospital-
ized at Billings receive the services
of senior members of the staff, includ-
ing such well known surgeons as Dr.
Dallas B. Phemister and Dr. Alex-
ander Brumschwig.

According to Dr. Thomas W. Park,
Assistant Dean of the Division of
Biological sciences, and Dr. A. W.
Bachmeyer, Director of Billings
Hospital, the Biological sciences and
the medical school are very much in-
terested in the problem of student
health, and are eager to improve the
"already cordial relations which exist
between our divison and that depart-
ment.”

College Cinder
Team Captures
Third Triumph

BY DAVE BRODER

The College Track Team bounced
back from a mediocre showing in the
Wheaton Relays to take a weak South
Shore High team over the coals in
both the Senior and Junior divisions.
The team scores, 96-17 in the Senior
and 79-16 in the Junor, give but one
indication of the individual brilliance
and team strength that marked the
Thursday afternoon meet.

Outstanding performance of the
day was again turned in by Bob Lin-
sicome, U. High athlete and captain
of the Junior team, wl^o himself
earned more than twice the total of
the South Shore team. Bob’s wins in
the 50, the 100, the 220, the low hur-
dles, the high jump, and the broad
jump, seconds in the shotput and dis-
cus, and anchor lap of the winning
Junor relay added up to 33% points.
Other winning performances in the
Junior division were turned in by
Charlie Forck in the 660 and Charlie
Huggins in the discus.

High-point man in the Senior was
Bob Petty, who won the discus, took
second in the shotput, the 100, the 220,
and ran in the 880 relay. Dave Hall
contributed 13 points by virtue of
wins in the 440 and 880 and a second
in the broad jump, and Captain Bob
Collins anchored the Senior relay
team, in addition to winning the high
and low hurdles. Other Senior win-
ners included “Skinny” Hanson and
Frank Mangin, who dead-heated in
the mile, Dave Weaver in the high
jump, Don Bushnell in the broad
jump, and Chuck Ferris in the pole
vault.

An indication of the team strength
may be seen in the number of sweeps
that the Juniors and Seniors turned
in. The high jump and hurdles in the
Junior division were swept, and in
almost every other event U. High
placed two men. The Seniors swept
both hurdles, the 440, the 880, the
high jump, the broad jump and the
discus.

Tonight the Senior team goes to
the Proviso Relays at Proviso, Illinois,
where they will be up against the top
schools of Northern Illinois. In com-
petition of this caliber last week at
Wheaton, the Seniors picked up only
seven points, thanks to Dave Hall’s
third in the broad jump anp a fourth
in the shuttle hurdles relay.

UC Acrobat Enters
National Contest

Winner of Central AAU elimina-
tions, Louis Levitt, a second year
student in the law school, left
here yesterday for the National
gymnastic finals in Jersey City.

Levitt, a side horse champion,
has won the Central amateur title
for three consecutive years.

He will represent the University.

Netmen Seeking 5th
Triumph Tomorrow

Going after its fifth straight tennis
meet, Coach Nels Norgren’s unde-
feated squad will meet Illinois Tech
tomorrow at 2:00 on the Maroon’s
home courts at 58th and University.

The Maroons defeated North Cen-
tral’s racketmen for the second time
last Saturday, blanking the Central
team 6-0 in a repeat performance of
their season opener. Following their
first meet, Norgren’s men proceeded
to down Northwestern 8 to 1 and
Illinois Tech 6 to 1.

Nip Concordia
As Hauck And
Smith Sparkle

By JACK HILL

The Chicago Maroons broke into
the win column for the first time in
four games last Saturday when Con-
cordia fell before the new found pow-
er in Chicago batting.

Playing at Concordia, Coach Kyle
Anderson’s men punched across 12
runs to the home team’s 9 to back up
pitchers Kurt Smith and Lefty Hauck.
The Maroons meet Wheaton tomorrow
morning while Concordia returns here
Wednesday, May 9 on the Midway
field at 4:00.

By juggling the lineup, Anderson
was at last able to find a winning
combination. Smith was moved from
third base to the pitching mound
while George Steele shifted to third
from the outfield. Smth was well
ahead of Concorda for most of the

game until Hauck relieved him in the
eighth inning with the bases loaded
and one out. Hauck was able to re-
tire the side after allowing only one
run on a balk pitch and he continued
the rest of the way for Chicago with-
out mishap.

Jim Servies, a hot and cold second
baseman until this game, tightened up
and played better caliber ball while
Steele at third base was well-nigh
flawless. Jimmy Vaughn led the hit
parade with a triple and a double.
