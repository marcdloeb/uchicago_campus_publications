These directories list all mem-

are not for sale.

U. of C. Expansion
Menaced; Probe
Housing for Vets

Sounding a grim warning that the “housing situation** is
critical and rapidly approaching a crisis, administration author-
ities revealed this week that future expansion of the student
body may be halted by lack of facilities.

A gloomy picture for future expansion was painted in a
special report which disclosed that over 1300 students in the
Divisions will lack housing facilites next fall if normal de-
velopment of the University continues.

Reliable administrative sources have described the problem
as the “most serious” confronting the University today. On
widely divergent fronts action to solve the problem appeared
to be under way yesterday, but there was no official comment.
Study Housing for Ex-G.l.'s

No new information has been released on plans to erect 200
temporary prefabricated houses for veterans on University
grounds as disclosed two weeks ago by Mayor Edward Kelly
to metropolitan newspapers. The prefabricated houses, accord-
ing to the newspaper reports will be obtained from the govern-
ment and will be used to house some of the 570 ex-GI’s now
enrolled in the University.

No additional information has been released relative to con-
struction of a $1,500,000 faculty housing project or of plans
for construction of new student dormitories, though proposals
are reported to be under study.

Enrollment bans are already being invoked because of the
lack of housing and several hundred students will be denied
admittance to the institution in the winter quarter.

Capacity Set at 1,621

The administration housing re-
port revealed that the University
now has a total housing capacity
for 1,621 students including 862
assigned to the College and 759
to the Divisions. Included are four
fraternity houses which are ex-
pected to be returned to the social
groups by the spring quarter; In-
ternational House, dormitories,
and University-owned apartments.
There are 944 out-of-town stu-
dents enrolled in The College and
1,703 non-Chicago matriculants in
the Divisions. Thus nearly 100 stu-
dents in the College and 850 in
the Divisions cannot be housed by
the University at this time.

lege was to continue at its current

Sub Rosa Communist Club
Revival Under Way Here

Revival of the Communist Youth
Party appeared to be under way
here yesterday, but well known
campus left-wingers refused com-
ment.

In a three-page mimeograph
publication distributed by mail to
several hundred students, the “U
of C. branch of the Communist
party” announced that it “will
publish a series of political news-
letters.”

The newspaper, “The Campus
Communist,” extended an invita-
tion to all University students to
attend a meeting Sunday evening
at 8:15 at the Community Book-
shop, 1404 E. 55th St, at which

Prof. Dryden Phelps will discuss
China’s destiny.

Meantime, efforts by THE CHI-
CAGO MAROON to trace leaders
of the organization met with a
blank. The Bookshop, who inserted
an advertisement in THE MA-
ROON announcing the meeting,
refused to disclose who had re-
served a meeting room in the rear
of its store for the meeting.

The Office of the Dean of Stu-
dents said it had given no official
recognition to a campus Commu-
nist group since 1941, and had no
information relative to the new
gioup. Ttie Abraham Lincoln Club

YELLA PESSL, HARPSICHORDIST

Don Shields

Memo to Women s Honor
Clubs: Reorganize Now!

Famed Harpsichordist
To Play Here Nov. 30

If you’ve ever taken the trouble to identify
the array of club and/or fraternity pins worn
by some of our campus people, you may have
noticed a young lady or two sporting what
appeared to be a small gold goat’s head.

Well, it was a goat’s head and it proclaims
the wearer a member of Nu Pi Sigma, the Sen-
ior Women’s Honorary Society. Through cus-
tom and convention Nu Pi ceased being an
academic honorary years ago.

The group’s change, however, from a purely
academic honor to a forum was one that both-
ered nobody. Even after the change there were
never found in Nu Pi the ugly racial and re-
ligious prejudices prevailing in many of the
social clubs. Election was determined by
leadership in the more important social and
service organizations and was not restricted
to those who were merely white, gentile, and
affiliated with a club. In short, Nu Pi was re-
spected and supported by the student body
because it represented intelligent student'
opinion from all sections of the campus.

In the past two or three years, however, our
Senior Women’s Honorary has been under-
going another change which is turning the
organization, as one member put it the other

day, into nothing more than an exclusive sup-
per club. The strong leadership that was once
the hallmark of Nu Pi is now practically non-
existent. The individual members themselves
are still sincere, intelligent girls, but no more
than three or four of them can, by any stretch
of the imagination, be called student leaders.

Time was when Nu Pi meetings were forums
for the discussion of important student prob-
lems. Nowadays the members sit around and
wonder vaguely what can be done about
“school spirit.” Formerly the Nu Pi well un-
derstood that “school spirit” is something that
is never lacking on any college campus, but
that purpose and direction for this “spirit”
were frequently absent. They also understood
that the traditional function of their organi-
zation was to provide this purpose and direc-
tion. And provide it they did because they had
the respect of the campus at large.

Today not one student in ten has ever heard
of a Senior Women’s Honorary, and this is not
because Nu Pi has maintained its tradition of
careful avoidance of all publicity, but simply
because it has had nothing significant to offer
the campus. It’s about time the good ladies set
about re-organizing their group. -

Yelia Pessl, eminent harpsichordist, will be presented in
recital on the third of the University Concerts series on Fri-
day, November 30, at 8:30 p.m., in Mandel Hall.

Assisted by Harvey Noack, flautist, and Dudley Powers,
violincellist, first-desk players from the Chicago Symphony,
Miss Pessl will present a program of eighteenth century mu-
sic.

With Mr. Noack and Mr. Powers, Miss Pessl will play the
Trio en concert No. 3 by Charles Dieupart (1707-1740), a
little known French composer, some of whose music Johann
Sebastian Bach is believed to have studied and the fifth in
a set of five Pieces de clavecin en concerts by Jean-Philippe
Rameau, the greatest French classical master.

Map Plan for College

Pictorial Annual Here

Plans for a projected College annual are already well under
way, Federick Gottesman, Counsellor on Student Publications,
announced yesterday.

It will not be a traditional yearbook with the usual class
pictures; the existing class structure makes this impossible. In-

stead, the book will be semi-pic-
torial, covering activities of the
year in all four years of the Col-
lege, and spotlighting well known
students who figure in campus
life.

Publication is scheduled for some
time in the Spring quarter. The
price has been tentatively set at
about $1 and the book will num-
ber from 50 to 100 pages.

All staff positions are still open.
Acting editors are being appointed
to carry on the work until such
time as there can be a general
staff election. People skilled in
art and photography are espe-
cially needed, and also those in-
terested in the business depart-
ment.

Steps have also been taken to
set up a divisional literary quar-
terly review. Several well quali-
fied students have shown interest,
Gottesman reported, and plans are
now being discussed.

Critic, the campus literary mag-
azine, is cheduled for release on
Monday.

Forum Plans
Debate Class

The Student Forum has an-
nounced classes in debate tech-
nique and strategy, and methods
of research, to be held in the For-
u moffice on Tuesday and Friday
afternoons at 4:00 p.m. throughout
the winter and possibly the spring
quarter.

Instruction will be given by the
coaches of the debate team and
by members of the faculty. Mem-
bers of dormitory debate teams
'who plan to compete in the intra-
mural debate tournament, tenta-
tively scheduled for late in the
winter quarter, are encouraged to
take advantage of this opportunity.

ners.

Editorial of Week

Censorship
Ban Feared
At Princeton

Free speech oh every campus
is the rightful heritage of every
generation, the editor of the
PRINCETON BULLETIN
said this week after administra-
tive authorities announced sup-
port of a policy which would
invoke “blue penciling” of Nas-
sau publications.

The graduate council of the
University had recommended that
“only a policy of blue pencil in
regard to student publications can
save the University a red face.”
Content of many publications “has
been in bad taste,” said the report.

The reply of the Princeton edi-
tor to the proposed censorship fol-
lows:

“We, primarily as budding jour-
nalists, and secondly as under-
graduates are inclined to agree
with the lone dissenting voice on
the Graduate Council Committee
on Undergraduate Activities, Mr.
Furman (a member of the Com-
mittee), who said undergraduate
publications must be free of ad-
ministration or faculty control.

“Mr. Furman went, on to say
that only complete freedom of ex-
pression can give the experience
of shouldering responsibility, and
only the unhampered right to
speak out can maintain under-
graduate morale. Free speech on
the campus is the rightful heritage
of the present generation.

“There are, probably, two sides
to the argument. The rest of the
committee states that ‘use of a
good blue pencil can do much to
save the University a red face?

“But freedom of speech is not
only the heritage of the present
generation, it is an inalienable
right owned by all generations in
America, and it is one which must
remain undisputed. To have the
only means of expressing them-
selves denied the undergraduate
body is encroaching upon these
rights.

“If all publications ostensibly
run by students are controlled by
Nassau Hall, then they cease to be
undergraduate publications. If they
retain their identity, then it is
merely the University’s position to
see that their subject matter does
not become pornographic in na-
ture, but, beyond those bounds,
the University should have no
control. Freedom of the press and
freedom of speech must be held
sacred above all other things.”

Sound Advice

The editor .of the Minnesota
Daily had sound advice yesterday
for the editor of an M. U. humor
magazine.

His editorial follows

“An editorial appearing in the
November Ski-U-Mah (a humor
magazine), goes into a two-column
harangue attacking the Univer-
sity’s night life social program.
It says:

“It adds up to this.'This Uni-
versity has not adequately pro-
vided facilities for the primary
American social function, the date.
The namby-pamby sun-up to sun-
down system is no good. And,
until someone highup solves this
campus-wide problem, the public
will continue to hear of students
drunk in bars, rules broken in
fraternities and sororities.”

The Daily offers a simple solu-
tion: Sleep. Many persons try it
from time to time. And a little
sleep might help the Skum edi-
torial board to write something
better than such adolescent drivel.
Then, too, students are here os-
tensibly for an education.

Science and Leadership

In the Atom-Bomb Age

In all the great sea of words which flowed to the world since
that fateful August morning at Hiroshima, not the least signi-
ficant statements have been those of the nation’s scientists. We
have witnessed—perhaps unknowingly—the most spectacular
intellectual reversal in the long and brilliant history of science.
The realization that the responsibility of the scientist must
necessarily extend beyond the confines of the laboratory is one
of the most epoch-making events in the intellectual history of
our time.

The atom bomb poses to education and to science its greatest
challenge. Our political leadership today is morally bankrupt.
The great tragedy of our time is the lack of greatness at the
hour for greatness. Ill prepared though they are by nature and
by their training to assume the leadership to which they have
-fallen heir, a leadership largely by default, science, has re-
■ sponded to the challenge.

This University has come to the realization that ostrich-like
it cannot bury its head in the sand to avoid the passing realities
of the day. The response of the scientists has been heartening.
Unknown to many, the University of Chicago, in collaboration
with most of the nation’s scientists, is sponsoring one of the
most vociferous and hardest hitting lobbies in Washington.
But it is a new type of pressure group; it seeks the unadorned
truth.

The problem of the atom-bomb to this University is three-
fold. It involves first and fundamentally political leadership. It
is tremendously important that our statesmen and the public
be made to understand the significance of The Bomb in the
present and in the future. If we are to avoid catstrophe, it is
essential that the scientists make it plain that there is no secret
to atomic fission; that in unlocking the atom we have the key
te-a golden age of peaceful economic prosperity; and that it is
immoral and impossible for any nation to claim priority or a
“sacred trust” of knowledge which is of significance to all man-
kind. It is not an easy task. The public and the Congress are
physically and mentally tired; they are suspicious of educators
and their motives. But never in history has mankind needed
intellectual leadership so badly. We cannot escape those re-
sponsibilities.

It should be equally evident that scientific research cannot
be stymied by further delays in policy. The rigid control which
the government has proposed to maintain over research is in-
tolerable. The scientists should make it clearly known that they
will refuse to continue their governmental investigations—
either for peace or war purposes—if their academic freedoms
are violated.

.The University has a further responsibility to the students
themselves. The titanic struggle which has been waged at this
University for over a decade over the relative merits of special-
ized science as opposed "to generalized education is fast ap-
proaching an end. By the acknowledgement that it cannot
escape the responsibility for the social implications of its ex-
periments science has confessed that a liberal, general education
is the groundwork for peace and democratic citizenship. Man
is a political animal.

Similarly, as science advances to new frontiers a greater
need for specialization becomes apparent. We shall have to
reconstruct our educational structure. An education which ends
at the age of 20 simply will not be adequate in the atom-bomb
aSe* The great truth that education is an unending lifetime |
process has now become strikingly apparent.

Educational and
Otherwise . . .

Princeton University is embroiled in one of those neat little
dilemmas that confront every University newspaper at one time
or another. The administration has signatured a report which
recommends a policy of enlightened censorship “to prevent
embarrassment to the institution.” The editor of the Princeton
Bulletin and his staff are indignant.

This is not the first time that a
University administration has at-
tempted to suppress editorial free-
dom in a college newspaper. It is
a tragic paradox, for liberty is the
foundation for any enquiry into
the truth, and it is the truth which
is the bedrock upon which any
University must be founded.

This problem is the fundamental
issue confronting college newspa-
per editors today. What should be
the policy of a University news-
paper in the modern world? How
effective can its policies be In the
moulding of student opinion?
What are the significant issues
with which a college newspaper
must deal? Even more funda-
mentally, what is the function of
a University newspaper on any
campus?

In recent weeks, the editors of
THE MAROON have come to grips
with the same stubborn ques-
tions. The issue of editorial sanc-
tity is, however, not the question
here that it is at Princeton. Since
its inception in 1898 the University
has been committed to the policy
that THE MAROON shall be per-
mitted maximum freedom. Such a
policy presupposes, of necessity,
the essential integrity of the edi-
tors and a devotion to the Uni-
versity and to the principles for
which it stands.

If a college newspaper has the
freedom, therefore, as THE MA-
ROON does, to consider the rela-
tive merits of an issue without
regard to its origin, it may be said
to have editorial freedom. The
editorial policy of THE MAROON
has been founded upon that con-
viction. We have disagreed and
we will continue to disagree with
the administration on certain is-
sues confronting the University.

The problem then is not so
much one of a crusade for free-
dom from control, for the freedom
already exists, but it is the more
challenging question of a positive
policy.

Any newspaper is a service. Its
first reason d’etre is the dissemi-
nation of news. A University
newspaper has the additional re-
sponsibility of serving as a train-
ing ground for prospective jour-

nalists and offering a sufficiently
attractive program so as to consti-
tute a student activity. And just
as every newspaper, a collegiate
journal must provide editorial
leadership.

It is fallacious to argue that any
newspaper must mirror opinion. It
has been well said that one must
never underestimate the intelli-
gence of the public, nor ever over-
estimate its knowledge. As such,
I do not believe that it is possible
for the policy of a University
newspaper to merely reflect the
widely divergent opinions of the
hundreds of groups on a large
campus. The problem is to lend
cohesion and leadership to those
opinions.

Any issue which is of signifi-
cance to the University should be
of significance to the college news-
paper. I do not believe it out of
place, therefore, for THE MA-
ROON to probe into such prob-
lems as the question of the pro-
motion of professors and the basis
for such promotions. The prob-
lem of the content of the curricu-
lum, the aim and scope of student
activities, the University’s position
in the political sphere, and the
question of racial and religious
discrimination in the University
itself are all legitimate subject
matter for any editor.

No wiser policy in dealing with
such questions could be proposed •
than that recommended to the St.
Louis Post Dispatch by Joseph
Pulitzer upon his retirement. “I
know that my retirement,” he
wrote, “will make no difference
in the paper’s cardinal principles;
that it will always fight for prog-
ress and reform, never tolerate
injustice or corruption, always op-
pose privileged classes and public
plunderers, never lack sympathy
with the poor, always remain de-

independent; never be afraid to	i

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Activity Fee Plan Opposed

Ellen Baum

Here, MAROON Poll Reveals

Judy Downs

With the recent increases in enrollment, supposedly provid-
ing adequate support for campus activities, the question of a
compulsory student activity fee demands attention. The fee
would be paid by each student at pie beginning of each quarter,
and would entitle him to admission to all University sponsored

events and a free subscription to
all University publications.

To the question: “Would you
favor a student activity fee?” 77%
of the students asked replied “no,”
23%, “Yes” in the Chicago Maroon
poll. While students in the college
were for the most part against it,
the divisional students were split
50-50.

Of those answering “no,” 15%
would approve the plan if it was
made voluntary. (Some cited the

William Wash-
ington: “T h e
function of a
student here
should be an
understanding
of the curricu-
lum ... it
should be rich
enough to make
activities su-
perfluous.”

cases of those whose jobs or other
responsibilities limited their time,
while others simply did not wish
to surrender irrevocably their
freedom of choice.

The most frequently occuring
complaint of the emphatic no’s
was, “No time, no money.* Many
felt that their budgets and study
schedules permitted only a few

er: “Yes, but it

carefully chosen activities, so that
a fee would be an imposition.
Claiming that this school cost
enough already, someone suggested
the inclusion of fee in the $20 Uni-
versity fee. The existence of stu-
dent interest in activities sufficient
to warrant such a fee was ques-
tioned, as were the merits of the
activities themselves.

Some comments were, “The plan
does not investigate the merits or
demerits of individual activities for
individual students”; “There is no
need for a false stimulus to student
participation”; “It has no place in
a liberal education”; “You cannot

The Critic's Corner

The University College chamber concert on November 21,
offered three sonatas for violin and piano, played by John'
Weicher, concert-master of the Chicago Symphony, and Perry
O’Neill, pianist.

The program opened with Han-
del’s Sonata No. 4 in D Major, a

patrician work, revelatory of Han-
del’s aristocratic grace and nobil-
ity. This was followed by Mozart’s
slight two-movement Sonata in A,
K. 305, in which the two move-
ments constitute a running dia-
logue between the two instru-
ments. Last on the program was
Ravel’s Sonata for Violin and
Piano, one of the composer’s ex-
periments with jazz. The middle
movement is a Blues, but not a
very successful one: a stringed
instrument is not susceptible to
produce the right aural color.
Ravel’s piano concerto—the one
for both hands—and his jazz study
Five o’clock are more successful
imitations.

The first allegro of the Handel
sonata had an excellent pace and
firm rate, so often lacking in per-
formances of the work. In the lar-

generalize accurately with regard
to student needs.”

The outstanding advantage, for
those who favored the fee, was the
provision of a definite income for
activities. Since the University
cannot supply them with more
than a part of what they need,
assured funds would mean more
efficient planning and better pro-
grams. The need for improved or-
ganization of activities was

Sid Levy:	^QM^k

“. . . too force-
ful. The Uni-	1

versity should
have a cohesive
social program A Y
that would en- \W
list students’	/ \

voluntary sup-
port.”

stressed; one student clamored for
“reform” to snap activities out of
their present state of paralysis,
while another suggested that one
organization be placed at the head
of all campus activities.

Various other benefits were
mentioned, such as the saving of
money by the student, student
participation and the stimulation
of that thing called school spirit.
There were a few indignant com-
ments about the individualism of
students here; “The fee would
make the University into more of
a community”; “There are too
many little groups on campus, the
fee might get students out of their
shells.”

Books Listed

Three books about America are
included in the volumes to be re-
leased during the next few months
by the University of Chicago
Press. They are The Growth of
Constitutional Power in the United
States, by Carl Brent Swisher;
The Last Trek of the Indians, by
Grant Foreman; and Warriors

Rachmiel Levine, M.D.

ghetto Weicher had a fine singing
tone, but one which was some-
times oily. The final allegro, which
also occurs in Handel’s Concerto
Grosso in G Minor, might have
been faster paced. In the allegro
of the Mozart sonata, Mr. O’Neill
exhibited his usual vigorous play-
ing. In the andante, however, he
confused heavy-handedness with
fortissimo playing.

The Ravel sonata is a carefully
balanced work which requires
precision blending of the two in-
struments to unfold. This it had
in the performance under con-
sideration. The first movement
with its rolling accompanying fig-
ure in the piano, a Ravel charac-
teristic, was as softly spun as silk.
The finale, a perpetual motion, is
an interesting technical study, but
not much more.

The long awaited Hot Club of
Chicago has at last materialized.
The organization and activities of
the club were set up this month
by a committee of fifteen Chicago
jazz lovers, including musicians,
collectors, and journalists.

Chairman of the committee is
John Lucas, feature writer of
Down Beat magazine, and pro-
spective Ph.D. of Chicago’s Eng-
lish department. Other officers
are: co-chairman, Katherine Ja-
cobsen; treasurer, George Hoefer;
secretary, John Schenck, and pub-
licity director, Ben Lincoln.

Activities of the Hot Club of
Chicago include the presentation
of monthly jazz concerts, and jazz
lectures, and the publication of a
club magazine. Membership fee,
which covers deductions on con-
certs and magazine subscription,
is $1.00 per year, to be mailed to
George Hoefer, 2 East Banks
Street.

The Club’s first concert will be
presented Sunday, December 16,
from 2:00 till 5:00 p.m. at the
Moose Club, 1016 North Dearborn.
The concerts will be held in a
strictly informal atmosphere with
dancing encouraged. At the first
concert, Earl Hines will lead a six-
piece band featuring alto man
Scoops Carey and drummer Red
Saunders.

Renaissance
Lecture Topic

Arnold Bergstraesser, Assistant
Professor of German Cultural His-
tory, is delivering a series of pub-
lic lectures this quarter on The
Interpretation of the Renaissance.
During these Wednesday evening
sessions from 7:30 to 9:30, Berg-
straesser has discussed the main
trends in contemporary interpre-
tation of the Renaissance, and has
surveyed historical development in
that period.

Professor Bergstraesser’s lec-
tures have covered different per-
sonalities of the Renaissance, each
one closely connected with such
topics as the beginnings of scienti-
fic observation, humanism, art, re-
ligion, and modern political theory.
His two remaining lectures are
scheduled for December 5 and
December 12.

Professor Bergstraesser is a
member of the Department of Ger-
manic Languages and Literatures,
and came to the University in 1934
from Claremont College where he
was a professor of European his-
tory. He has studied at the Uni-

The Suspicious Pennsylvanians

Last week the University sent up a flight of balloons, one
of which landed in a farmer’s backyard near Newcastle, Penn-
sylvania. One of our physics instructors drove down to get the
balloon and thereon hangs a pretty tale. It seems the farmer
was a rather suspicious soul and wanted to make sure, in the
interests of science, that only a duly accredited person would
take the balloon. He notified the state police who kept watch
on the balloon and they descended en masse when said in-
structor claimed the balloon as a member of the U. of C. staff.
He was subjected to a veritable third degree about his life,
identity, credentials, and the contents of the balloon. The crucial
part of the identification was how many radio tubes were con-
tained in the apparatus. Friend instructor answered 49 where-
upon the police nearly clapped him in jail—they counted only 48.
At long last after he had explained and demonstrated the
whereabouts of the 49th tube, they let let him depart in peace
bearing the balloon.

Return to the Old Days

A wild-eyed student dashed up to us a little while ago in
Classics Library gasping that the dead had come to life. We listened
sympathetically (after all, she had been studying a little too hard
for comps) as she told the incredible story that two rather famous
personages were now studying in Classics, one having died in 1822
and the other in 1870. Humoring her along, we consented to follow
her over to the desk where said persons were supposedly studying.
We regret to announce that she is correct: there written in bold
script on the name tags are the names of Percy Bysshe Shelley and
Charles Dickens.

The sponsors of the bonfire tonight have been running into
slight difficulties this week, the main one being a small matter of
thirteen dollars and fifty cents; it seems that B & G has to be paid
for the wood that goes into the fire. . . . We would suggest that
when you come tonight, you bring a box or two of kindling or at
least an old textbook. Our hitchhikers are at it again—Tex Morgan
and Don Johnson hitched to Detroit for their dinner. The Burton-
Judson steampipe radio goes back into operation next week. The
Sigmas and Psi U’s are having an informal party at the Southmoor

Not so Near Campus

If you can’t find your friends* at school, you’ll probably find
them down at the revival of the Desert Song (supposedly the most
popular revival of the decade); among those we saw were Tidi
Evans with John Markham and Marge Moffet with Greg Thomas.
Various of Chicago students have been finding work for idle hands
lately by working at the Montgomery Ward strike headquarters-
one reports that she has been busily engaged in making a few phone
calls, putting music on the loudspeaker, and eating hot dogs. . . .

A la Carte?

At lunch in the Cloisters Club Tuesday we heard a most unusual
sound, strangely reminiscent of a flight of ducks wending their
way northward. After diligent search, we uncovered the source of
the noise—one happy student had purchased a duck call (eruditely
she explained that it was a canvasback duck call, not teal or mallard)
and was sounding it in the spacious halls of Ida Noyes in hopes of
getting something different for lunch.

Noted Poet Teaching Here

-------------------------------------J---------------------------

As an exchange professor from &e University of Louisiana,
Cleanth Brooks will continue to conduct courses at the Uni-
versity in the English Department during the winter quarter.

Mr. Brooks, who is now teach-
ing classes in the theory of poetry
as well as a section of Humanities
2 in the College, is generally con-
ceded to be one of the foremost
poetry critics of the day. Mr.
Brooks studied at Oxford and ob-
tained his B.A. and Litt.B. there.
He has taught in Texas, Michigan,
and Louisiana..

Recently Mr. Brooks* activities
have centered around the manag-
ing editorship and the editorship
of the Southern Review, a quar-
terly devoted to review and criti-
cism of fiction and poetry as well
as political commentary. His co-
worker on this project was R. B.
Warren, who is now teaching at
the University of Minnesota. Mr.
Warren is a collaborator of long
standing, having worked with Mr.
Brooxs on two of a sei lea of text-

books on understanding poetry
and fiction.

On his own, the professor has
authored a volume entitled Mod-
ern Poetry and Tradition. His
latest work, The Well-Wrought
Urn, will be off the presses some
time next year. These are both
books of criticism and theory of
poetry.

In answer to inquiries as to the
origin of his honeyed drawl, Pro-
fessor Brooks will admit that he
comes by it honestly, being a na-
tive of the country’s southland.
“However,” he admonishes, “never
trust an English professor’s accent.
It’s likely to be contaminated by
any number of affectations.”

The Professor is also the author
of an authoritative monograph on
southern speech.

On the Beam

I

All America had ringside seats for a bloody performance
in the early 1920’s. Sponsoring the performance were men who
were afraid of the growing unity of the people against the in-
justice of economic insecurity. The price of a seat was the price
of a newspaper. The performance began with a wave of hot
feeling against “Radicals, Reds,
aliens, Socialists, Bolsheviks, agi-
tators, Labor Unions and rene-
gades of religion.” “The arena was
then the seen* of U.S. Attorney-
General Palmer’s witchhunt raids.

The smashing climax was the Sac-
co-Vanzetti case. These two men,
on charges of murdering a pay-
master, were swept into this dra-
ma, were convicted for their an-
archist views rather than on the
evidence presented, and were ex-
ecuted. When the hot feelings
cooled, the sponsors were satis-
fied—for them the performance
was a success. American people
were divided, were suspicious of
each other and practiced scape-
goatism when the occasion pre-
sented itself. Economic insecurity
thrived. '

It’s here again

Many Americans still have not
learned yet. Today again perform-
ances are going on. Again lynch-
ings, baiting, hysteria and disunity
are the order of the day in many
a community. ..It’s starting again
just as in the days of Sacco-
Vanzetti.

“Winterset” is OK

That is why the Players Guild
production “Winterset” is signifi-
cant. This play is based on the
Sacco-Vanzetti case. This column
takes its hat off to all the students
responsible for its production,
from the leading stars to the pub-
licity men who posted the billing.
We ignore the destructive com-
ments made on technical grounds
and further contend that for ama-
teurs, they are to be congratulated.
They have the thanks of the au-
dience who saw something of the
truth of what happened in 1920.
The Players Guild members were
On The Beam in bringing this
message to the public. Analyzing
the play itself, this column sees it
a job half-done. The audience
should see the use of the names of
Sacco-Vanzetti instead of “Ro-
magna”; Madeiros instead of
“Trock Estrella”; Judge Webster
Thayer instead of “Gaunt.” There
further was no expose and con-
viction of the forces behind the
“red scare” that resulted in the

murder of two innocent men.

Keep it up

This column hopes that more
such productions will come and
urges the audience to be On The
Beam all the time against those
who perpetrate the modern Sacco-
Vanzetti frame-ups.

contention that these events are
irrelevant to American security, I
quote Corporal Milton J. Wynne
in his “Why I Hate The Nazis.”

“They are trying again.
Right this minute they’re try-
ing again. Before the gun is
cold or the earth healed or
the towns rebuilt or the dead
buried or the guilty punished
—they’re trying again. In
Spain and Argentina, in Por-
tugal and the other “neutrals”
in Europe and in Asia and
right here at home—the same
guys are at it again. The big
shots with the cash. The guys
behind the guys who did the
dirt—the field marshalls and
the industrialists—the subtle
ones, the undercover ones, the
well-healed, well-connected
ones.”

Women Speakers
Meet Mundelein

The Campus Women’s Varsity
Debate Team met the Mundelein
College team Wednesday night in
the Reynolds Club, in the first of
a series of debates with other uni-
versities and colleges in the mid-
west. .

The teams debated on the Big
Ten question: resolved: that the
foreign policy of the United States
should be directed to the establish-
ment of free trade among the na-
tions of the world. Marcheta Mack
and Antoinette Totino represented
Chicago, taking the affirmative.

The next debate, with North-
western, scheduled for January 17,
is on the same topic. Increase in
available funds and elimination of
travel restrictions now make it
possible for the University to be
represented in meets all over the
nation.

the University
of Chicago on
Wednesday, De-

p.m.

In connection
with the com-
mittee’s direct
concern with
situations

or attitudes that deny equality to
individuals or groups, in fact or
by implication, this meeting will
be directed at fact-finding and
educational efforts in the field of
racial and religious discrimination
at the University.

Bulletin boards will announce
time and place of the meeting.

Critic Rips
Novelette by
UC Alumnus

Three Day Pass, by Leslie Waller;

Viking Press, $2.50.

This first novelette by a Univer-
sity alumnus is an undistinguished
war story. The plot is nil. In
simplest terms it is the story of a
soldier on a three-day pass who
comes to New York to meet his
girl friends. With three nights in
a bar-room and one night in a
hotel room the action is over. A
short concluding section takes the
soldier back to his camp destined
for shipment overseas.

This is another autobiographical
first novel. University students
and alumni will be particularly
interested in pp. 29 ff., and 104 ff.,
in which the author presents his
University days—sometimes thinly
disguised, sometimes openly. One
wonders what the reaction of
Pulse’s former editors will be to
the scathing attack on them.

The style is undistinguished. The
mental flashback, the mental dia-
logue, the flip gibberish, are all
worked and worn out before one
completes the book. A specimen:

“Atwas, ajoint, acalled, aDoc’s.
’Twas an inn yclept Doc’s. A dive,
hole, clip and there we were, fash-
ioning fashions against a fashion-
able fashground of fash, fashful,
fashic. Then, like a bolt from yon
blue, now cometh a song, a tune, a
melody, a tune nam-ed Muskat
Ramble. Now, kiddleys, theese
tchoon was in the birhgtest known
as Musk-Rat Ramble, but praise
be to the slurrable sluffing tongues
of Negroes, ’twas known as Mus-
KAT. A wery fawny sorcom-
stonce.

“Familiarly, I betook said tchoon
to my breast and there did suffer
it to suckle at great end, deriving
no nourishment from this bland
grount, but nurturing an abiding
pash for the fashful, fashing,
fash. . . .”

The reader may go on from here
if he chooses. The book and the
author are dated by the ideology
dispensed in the book, which re-
flects a peculiar trend on this
campus about 1942, an idea which
was quite prevalent in campus
left-wing thought (and seems oc-
casionally to have survived), that
our war was with Germany alone,
and that Japan was just an unfor-
tunate side-issue.

More than 60 married veterans

As a supplement to language

house has been established.

Dr. Katherine Clarke, Associate
Professor of French and house-

addition to perfecting conversa-
tional French, the project affords
an excellent means of gaining a
broader knowledge of French life
and culture. Although not all the
girls living at the house are
French majors, all wish to speak
the language as naturally as pos-

French on the first floor has been

50,000 RADARS

BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM

TWO years before Pearl Harbor the Govern-
ment asked Bell Telephone Laboratories to
help perfect radar as a military instrument. The
Bell System, through the Western Electric Com-
pany, its manufacturing branch, became the na-
tion's largest supplier of radar systems.

Bell scientists designed and developed many
different types of radars—each for a specific job.
One particular type was standard for B-29s in
the Pacific for navigation, target location and
high altitude bombing. Another directed all Navy
guns over five inches.

This is not surprising, for radar development
and production stem from the same roots that
produced and continue to nourish this country’s
telephone system.

Although veterans take the same
courses and meet the same class-
room competition as other stu-
dents, the University recognizes
that a little time may be required
to effect the shift from the mili-
tary routine to the more settled
campus life.

The program includes: (1) Es-
tablishment of a strictly advisory
Veterans Advisory Service, which
is not compulsory, but which is
available for any veteran seeking
its aid; (2) The elimination of
“red tape” in the veteran’s en-
rollment process; (3) Admission or
college credit for special training
received while in military service,
on the basis of credits fixed by
the American Council on Educa-
tion; (4) Admission at the age of
18 by special approval of veterans
with six or more months’ service,
although the age for non-veterans
is 21; (5) Encouragement of vet-
erans arriving in mid-term to sign
up as visitors in courses in which
they need refresher training, and
(6) Authorization of deans to re-
lax grade requirements during the
veteran’s first term in school.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Cage Opener Saturday

Techawks Invade
Fieldhouse for

I One Foot on the Rail

Spring has sprung, fall has fell, and winter has come at last.
Something happened to summer in there, but I haven’t got time
to look for it. Anyway, basketball follows close on the heels of
football, and, if you’ve been reading your school paper lately,
you probably know that Chicago’s season opens tomorrow
night, over in the fieldhouse, with Illinois Tech furnishing the

opposition.

Everybody, of course, has heard
about the big blowout tonight.
Around 8:30 p.m. everyone is go-
ing to gather in the circle for one
of the biggest pep rallies ever to
be seen around these parts. Ru-
mor has it that Gloria Jean of
movie fame will be present, along
with Dean Chidsey, Coach Nor-
gren, and various members of the
basketball team. There’ll be a big
bonfire, songs, talks by the afore-
mentioned folks, the effigy of Illi-
nois Tech is going to go up in
flames, and festivities will end
with a snake dance around the
campus.

In short, the Athletic Promo-
tion Committee has done one swell
job of getting the season off on
the right foot. Don’t miss it.
Everybody else will be there.

The idea behind the whole
thing is to inspire the basketball
team to such heights that they
could beat I.I.T. with three play-

Swimmers Set Pace in
Intra-Mural Leagues

Paced by the forthcoming Col-
lege House swimming relay meet
intra-mural athletics continued to
claim the attention and the time
of the majority of students in the
CoDege. The table-tennis tourna-
ment and the house basketball
league, neither of which begins
operation until the Winter Quarter,
found themselves taking a back-
seat as Burton-Judson court
turned its eyes on the approaching
aquatic clash scheduled for Tues-
day, December 4 in Bartlett pool.

Would-be mermen have been
working out for more than two
weeks under the tutelage of Var-
sity Coach McGillivray in prepa-
ration for this meet. Through com-
petition is to be based on team
performance, the participants thus
far have been working out indi-
vidually. Eventually, they will be
grouped into eight teams, repre-
senting the eight entries from B-J.

Meanwhile, table-tennis enthu-
siasts are holding elimination

many.

Starting Monday a new pro-
gram will be inaugurated in the
required physical education classes.
Its purpose is to find individual
weaknesses and to show each stu-
dent where she stands in relation
to other members of her class.
The testing program consists of
five tests: rhythm, posture, motor
ability, swimming, and ball han-
dling. The tests will, of course, be
scored, but will in no way affect
grades. Students will be advised
to enter classes of those activities
in which they show marked de-
ficiencies. It looks like a big step
toward fulfillment of the Physical
Education Department’s aim to
turn out all-around girls.

Last Wednesday night an un-
defeated Kelly Hall team took th*1
interhouse table tennis champion-



ers, Coach Norgren, and Chancel-
lor Hutchins on the floor.

Seriously, Coach Norgren has
plenty of able-looking boys out,
including holdovers Jon Sharp,
George Raby and Fred De Graw
from last year’s team, which had
a .500 average, including a win
and a loss against tomorrow’s foe.

Norgren refused to hazard a
guess as to the probable outcome
of the battle, except that Chicago
has a good chance. Illinois Tech
is strengthened by the presence of
a V-12 unit, but they had the V-12
unit last year, and we were good
enough to beat them then.

De Graw, Sharp, Raby, Lilien,
Freeark, Bradley and the rest
have all looked very sharp indeed
in practice, but experience may be
the deciding factor in the outcome.
Tomorrow night should at least
give us an idea as to how the team
is going to fare this season.

Junior Varsity
Cage Debut Set

First on the Junior Varsity’s
schedule for the season will be a
basketball game with Bowen High
School, to be played Saturday aft-
ernoon, December 1, in Bartlett
Gym. Coach Stampf is unwilling
to give any starting lineup, since
this is only a practice game, and
the team will be substituted freely.

The Junior Varsity plays in the
place of University High in the
Private School League. The team
is divided into two parts, the
heavies, made up of first and sec-
ond year students, and the lights,
made up of 10th and 11th graders
in the High School.

Cage Skipper

Thinclads to
Start Team
Practice

Track practice has started over
in the Field House under the guid-
ance of Coach Merriam. The
team, as yet, is not well organized
and several of the men Merriam
wants out have not appeared. He
is counting heavily on his cross
country star, Ken Mulcahy, who
just last week won a medal in the
N.C.A.A. cross country meet at
East Lansing, Michigan. Mulcahy
will run the half-mile and perhaps
the mile.

John Adams, one of last year’s
conference cross country stars, who
has had a disappointing season
this year because of a back injury,
is also a miler. Merriam is hoping
that his injury will work itself
out If it does, Chicago will be
better set in the distance runs than
it has been in years.

There are several promising
freshmen around the school whom
Merriam would like out, although
they may decide to compete in
other sports. Guy Nery, who pole
vaulted 11 feet for South Shore,
and Rolland Pipenbrink, an all-
around athlete from Crete, are
both more likely to play basket-
ball than to compete in track, and
they will probably be missed. Al-
though more men are needed in
order to make Chicago a real com-
petitor in the conference, the team
will be vastly improved over the
last two years.

Opener Dec. 1st

Chicago’s basketball season will swing under way tomorrow
night at eight in the Fieldhouse at 56th and University. The
Illinois Tech Techhawks will invade Chicago from their West
Side home with a strong team aided by a large V-12 unit, and
they are expected to provide a strong match for the Maroon

eagers in the opening contest.

Inasmuch as this is the first
game of the season and is only a
practice duel, Coach Nels Norgren
has made no announcement as to
the exact starting lineup, but it
will be picked from the following
men:

Forwards: DeGraw, Sharp, Brad-
ley, Riley, and Buoscia.

Centers: Raby and Elliston.

Guards: Lilien, Freeark, King,
Walker, and Franke.

The announced starting lineup
for Illinois Tech includes:

Forewards: Smart and Brown-
ing (Captain).

Center: Lake.

Guards: Evers and Murphy.

Throughout the years there has
been a bitter rivalry between the
two teams, with each team win-
ning about half the games. Last
year the two clubs split; I.T.T. won
the first game, 54 to 39, but Chi-
cago came back to win the sec-
ond, 51 to 43.

The Maroons have booked a 19-
game schedule, including a full
slate in the Big Ten. After a one-
year layoff because of lack of ma-
terial, Chicago has re-entered the
conference race.

Added attraction to Saturday
night’s game will be the Univer-
sity band under the direction of
Arpad EIo. The 16-piece band is
in trim for the opener with both
Chicago and visiting team songs.
The University cheer leaders will
also make their debut. .

All home basketball games will

ginning at 8 p.m.

there are not too many personal
handicaps placed against them,
the team has a good chance of

Fill Christmas Socks

For Settlement Groups

Filling of Christmas stockings for the children in the play
groups at the University Settlement House is already under
the sponsorship of the Student Settlement Board.

Stockings made by members
of the Board are now on sale at

the Ida Noyes main office, where
anyone may buy one for seven
cents. These stockings, packed
with candy and small toys, should
be returned to the office by De-
cember 12.

“We hope that everyone on or
off campus who might be inter-
ested in filling stockings will co-
operate with us,” stated Miss Mar-
guerite Kidwell, who is in charge
of all the service organizations on
campus.

Club parties and office em-
ployees’ parties have been given
on previous Christmases for the
filling of the stockings. When the
stockings are filled, they are ex-
hibited at an all-campus wassail
party sponsored by the Ida Noyes
Council, which this year will be
given on December 12.

Miss Kidwell suggested that the
stocking be filled specifically for,
either a girl or a boy of a speci-
fied age group.

Letters to Editor

Warn Against
Prep School
Race Strikes

To the Editor of the Chicago Maroon:

Most of you have read about the
recent race “strikes” in various
Chicago-area high schools. The
immediate purpose of these
“strikes” was to oust Negro stu-
dents from the schools. These
“strikes” were not spontaneous
uprisings of the student body but
were instigated and sponsored by
pro-fascist adults working with
a hoodlum element among the
students.

The American right of free ed-
ucation: the right to attend the
school we choose, is a basic right
of all youth, regardless of race,
creed, or nationality. This right
must be made a reality.

Race Superiority Fallacious

The idea of race superiority, a
scientific fallacy, is used constant-
ly by undemocratic forces every-
where as part of their divide and
conquer technique. Remember,
Hitler started with similar
“strikes” against the Jews and
ended by killing Americans.

When the strikes broke out in
Gary, the Executive Secretary of
American Youth for Democracy
was on the Fact-Finding Commit-
tee, along with representatives of
eleven other youth groups. As a
result of the investigation, they
isued a statement condemning the
strikes to the Gary authorities.
When the strikes at Englewood
High occurred, American Youth for
Democracy was represented in a
delegation of adults and youth
leaders who conferred with Mayor
Kelly on this problem and also
organized the “Youth Unity Ral-
ly” at Orchestra Hall on Septem-
ber 29 which 1,500 students from
Chicago high schools attended. At
the meeting Danny Kaye appealed
to all young people to guard
against the fascist dangers in the
outbreaks and to carry through
their democratic responsibilities
as young Americans.

Strikes Indicate Danger in America

These strikes are indicative of
a growing danger in America. As
the problems of the post-war pe-
riod become more acute, reaction-
ary interest will more and more
create racial tensions as a means
of diverting attention from the
real issues of the day, such as
unemployment accompanied by a
generally lowered standard of liv-
ing.

Let’s keep Hitler’s idea of race
superiority out of our schools!
It’s up to us to uphold our tradi-
tion of Democracy by refusing to
accept discrimination. Racial pre-
judice must be wiped out.

American Youth for Democracy.

To Publish Hew
Humor Magazine

There will be a meeting Monday,
December 3 at 3:00 p.m. in the
Reynolds Club, second floor, for
those students interested in an all-
campus Humor Magazine. Work is
starting now and a staff is being
formed for publication sometime
in January.

Writers, photographers, cartoon-
ists, artists, make-up men, those
with business, circulation, adver-
tising and promotion experience
who are interestsd are urged to
attend the informal meeting Mond-
day.

Communist ♦ ♦.

(Continued from Page 1)
of the Young Communist League
of America, youth section of the
Communist party, collapsed here
in December, 1943. American
Youth for Democracy was organ-
ized at a later date with a num-
ber of former Young Communist
league members but has always
denied Communist affiliations.

The office of the Counsellor of
Publications said the “Campus
Communist” had not been official-
ly registered as required by Uni-
versity regulations and could not
legally be distributed as a publi-
cation of a University of Chicago
student organization.

New Identification

Card Planned

Plans for a new student
identification card, which
might include a picture, a
birth date, and a metal name
plate, are under study by
the Office of the Dean of
Students.

The new cards would pro-

Forum Broadcasts Twice Monthly

As a result of the success of
this first program, the television
broadcasts will be presented once
a month. The Forum will also
broadcast two radio shows each
month, one from WJJD, the “Chi-
cago Speaks Forum,” and the
other from station WIND, “Town
Club of the Air.” The Student
Forum also will broadcast from
Radio Midway.

Station WBKB produces tele-
vision shows two nights a week.
In the Chicago vicinity there are
between 400 and 500 television
sets. Because of the limited num-
ber of sets, broadcasting is done
mostly to television parties, some-
times with as many as 200 people
gathering to see and hear the
programs.
