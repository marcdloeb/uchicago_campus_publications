Divisional Plan

Fraternities will continue to operate with a full schedule
until March 1947 an are now entertaining proposals for main-
taining programs in the divisions hereafter, James Halvorsen,
president of the I-F council revealed Wednesday.

Halvorsen said the fraternities have no intentions of with-

By Debaters

To Compete in Big 10;
Meet Mundelein First

Under the direction of Hubert
Wax, newly appointed director,
Albert Popham, Robert Voas, and
Helene Dubois, officers, the Uni-
versity of Chicago Student Forum
contemplates filling the busiest
calendar in its history this fall.

In order to meet its pressing
schedule adequately, the Forum
has been reorganized. A new
suite of offices has been taken in
the Reynolds Club, and the weekly
Forum is held in the club assem-
bly hall Thursday evenings. There
has been a large turnout for the
debate team, and classes in de-
bating and forensics are being
sponsored by the Forum.

The debate team already has a
schedule which includes North-
western University, Mundelein
College, and Loyola University.
Other meets are being arranged,
and the team will definitely com-
pete for the Big Ten title. Seven
or eight speaking engagements
have already been fulfilled.

The first debate on the Big Ten
question will be held with Mun-
delein College on Thursday, No-
vember 29, at 7:30 p.m. in Room
205 of the Reynolds Club. The
subject of the debate is “Resolved:
That the Foreign Policy of the
United States Should be Directed
to the Establishment of Free
Trade Among the Nations of the
World,” and it will be debated
affirmatively by Marqueeta Mack
and Antoinette Totino. The pub-
lic is invited to attend.

Influenza Vaccine
Available Today

Student Health announces that
a limited supply of influenza vac-
cine is available for students and
faculty members. Interested ap-
plicants should report for injec-
tions this afternoon at 1:30, at the
Student Health Clinic, Billings
Hospital.

their intentions
of continuing
within the area
permitted under
the Board of
Trustees’ ruling
handed down
last week.

He announced
that most fra-
ternities intend
to request the
return of their
houses, leased to

I The President

ERNEST C. COLWELL

President of the University and
one of the signers of the resolution
sent by the University council to
President Truman cautioning
against government control of
science and research.

Professors Fear

Free Research

May Be Muzzled

Fifty-one of the University’s most eminent professors and
administrators, members of the University senate, in a pre-
cedent-shattering appeal, this week called on President Truman
and Congress not to invade academic freedoms.

The resolution, adopted by the council of the University

the University for the duration,
by the Spring quarter. The leases
stipulated that the houses would
be returned six months after the
signing of the armistice.

Three Occupy Houses Now

Three fraternities — Phi Sigma
Delta, Phi Gamma Delta and Pi
Lambda Phi — currently occupy
houses, while the remaining seven
expect the return of their houses
by April 1.

“Fraternities have not been
abolished at the University of Chi-
cago and we plan to continue to
operate as heretofore,” Halvorsen
said. He pointed out that under
the board’s ruling rushing of col-
lege students is permitted until
March, 1947. Hence there will still
be students in the college in fra-
ternities until 1949.

To Plan for Future

The fraternities are investigat-
ing the feasibility of continuing in
the divisions which is dependent
on a number of contingencies, Hal-
vorsen said, including the graduate
enrollment, number of exchange
students, and classification of
graduate students.

The ten chapters here are now
in contact with the University of
Chicago Alumni Inter-Fraternity

New Drama

Head Here

Harley Smith, the new Director
of Dramatics who arrived here
this week, was recently discharged
as a Captain after four years of
service in the Army. Besides being
Director of Dramatics, he will be
in charge of non-athletic activities
in the college, an Assistant Pro-
fessor of Humanities, and resident
head of Dodd House.

Prior to his induction into the
Army, Mr. Smith was at Louisiana
State University, where he was
head of the Speech Education
Department and Director of Radio.

Mr. Smith, a Ph.D. in Lin-
guistices, is the author of SPEECH

senate, highest faculty ruling body,
was directed at proposed govern-
ment controls of atomic energy
research as contained in the May-
Johnson Atom-Bomb Bill now in
the senate.

A governmental-imposed black-
out on dissemination of scientific
information would menace the
safety of the nation, the professors
warned. They urged that no re-
strictions be imposed on teaching,
research, or communication of the
results of basic scientific research.
“Since the development of man-
kind requires that the freedom of
enquiry be protected in order to
preserve and enrich our civiliza-
tion.”

Would Shackle All Science

Shackling atomic research might
also seriously impair investigation
in other scientific fields, the Coun-
cil cautioned.

Its resolution was sent to the
President, the cabinet, and Con-
gressional leaders and contained
the signatures of the Central Ad-
ministration and the 51 professors.

The action was the first of its
kind ever taken by the University
of Chicago acting as a single group.
Resolution is Released

The resolution follows in full:

“The council of the University
of Chicago (the supreme academic
body) is deeply concerned with
the maintenance of the freedom
of research and the unrestricted
dissemination of scientific knowl-
edge,”

“The development of mankind
requires that the freedom of in-
quiry and dissemination of knowl-
edge be protected in order to pre-
serve and enrich our civilization.
The enormous advances in our
time in the sciences and arts have
come about in large part because
men have been free to pursue

Mitchell Tower Scene

Of "Human Adventure

That “The Human Adventure,”
dramatic radio program of the
Universtiy of Chicago will con-
tinue to be broadcast from Mitch-
ell Tower was announced by
George Probst, executive secre-
tary of the University radio office.

At present the program has

William Benton and Chancellor
Robert M. Hutchins. The board of
trustees of the University support-
ed the project by sanctioning the
investment of more than $40,000.
The program, which is a dramatic
presentation of science, knowledge
and University research, first ap-
peared on the Columbia Broadcast-
ing Sysetm in 1939 and returned to
the air in 1943 on Mutual Broad-
casting System. In this second ser-
ies on Mutual, the Encyclopaedia
Brittannica, which is associated
with the University, invested more
than $45,000 in the project.

Radio station WGN also carried
a considerable part of the pro-
duction cost in this same series
and it is unlikely that the program
could have been resumed without
this support and financial contri-
bution. The quality of the program
has steadily improved and in 1944
“The Human Adventure” received
the Peabody Award as the “best

A long list of refused applica-
tions for admission to the Uni-
versity loomed here yesterday as
a result of lack of adequate
housing and classroom facilities.

The Office of Admissions, which
has been receiving an average of
75 inquiries each day, has an-
nounced that a limit of 150 stu-
dents will be admitted to the Col-
lege for the Winter quarter. Fifty
new applicants will be first and
second year students and the bal-

ance third and fourth year appli-
cants. The 150 figure includes
veterans to be admitted under the
G-I bill.

Tabulations released by the
Office of Admissions this week
reveal that 4917 students are
registered in the University this
quarter, either on a full or part-
time basis. This is an increase of
13H per cent over last year’s total,
it was pointed out.

Twelve hundred new students,

a record-shattering total, were ad-
mitted to the College this Fall.
250 entered in the first year, 71

Oriental Institute
Returns to Egypt

After more than five years away
from the field, the Oriental Insti-
tute has now been able to resume
field activity due to the end of
the war.

On Thursday, October 13, Dr.
and Mrs. Harold Nelson sailed
from New York on the Gripsholm
for Alexandria, Egypt. Dr. Nelson,
Professor Emeritus since last year,
is the Field Director of the Uni-
versity’s headquarters at Luxor,
Egypt.

Since 1924 the expedition at
Luxor has been copying the an-
cient Egyptians scenes and inscrip-
tions on the large temples of that
area. Dr. Nelson, who has directed
i the work from the beginning, left
| Luxor in May, 1940.

Sees New
Need for
Education

Atom-Bomb Imperilling
Civilization-Hutchins

“Atomic development will mean
a greater need for liberal educa-
tion,” asserted Chancellor Robert
Maynard Hutchins in his annual
report, “The State of the Univer-
sity,” released this week. “Educa-
tion may not save us, but it is the
only hope we have,” he warned.

“Without the bomb the prospects
of civilization would be dubious
enough,” writes Hutchins, “now
that we have it, they are black.’’

“The enormous acceleration of
science and technology must some-
how be matched by an intensifica-
tion of all those processes which
help us to understand what we
ought to do with science and tech-
nology; but these are educational
processes—notably the processes of
liberal education.”

Hutchins believes that the ‘se-
cret’ of the atomic bomb must be
shared with other nations. “No
hopes can be based on the so-called
‘secrecy’ of the atomic bomb. There
is no secret. The theory of the
process was well understood
throughout the world before the
war. What America has done is
to show that the theory will work.”

“No hopes can be based on the
notion that only America has the
industrial power to make the
theory work. The progress of re-
search must be in the direction of
more abundant material and
cheaper processes; and, in my
event, it cannot be assumed that
other nations will not some day
have industrial power comparable
to our own.”

Hutchins comments on the Van-
nevar Bush recommendations that
government funds be used to stim-
ulate teaching of and research in
science in all colleges and uni-
versities. He advances the idea
that the proposed scholarships and
fellowships will have the effect of
attracting all the talents of the
country into science.

“There can be no question that
they will have this tendency,”
warns the University Chancellor.
“The remedy, however, is not to
refuse to support science on this
ground, but to offer equal oppor-
tunities in other fields that are
equally important to the public.”

Hutchins goes on to state that
the education of our people for
freedom, the proper development
of our social and political institu-
tions, and the control and direction
of the results of scientific research
itself all depend upon our willing-
ness to foster the growth and
training of ability in fields unre-
lated to science.

“The scientific developments at
the University which are recorded
in this report are spectacular and
will have the most significant con-
sequences for the world,” added
Hutchins. “If they are not at the
last to do more harm than good,
they must be paralleled by a vita]
and effective program of liberal
education for all.”

Appoint New
Health Head

Among the more recent admini-
strational changes which took
place this quarter was the ap-
pointment of Dr. Ruth Taylor as
head of the Student Health Serv-
ice. Dr. Taylor, a graduate of the
University Medical School, is an
experienced member of the serv-
ice’s staff and has devoted her
attention to student needs for
some time.

One of her chief plans is the
furthering of Student Health to
its utmost activity. At the moment
a number of proposals have been
presented to the Board of Trustees
concerning the service, among
which are the addition of a dentist-

Maroon Jumped
Gun on Bomb

The atom-bomb may have
been the war’s biggest secret
to most Americans but it
came as a mere anti-climax
to the editors of THE MA-
ROON who inadvertently al-
most “spilled the beans” six
months before Pearl Harbor.

Alert readers of THE MA-
ROON could have learned of
the A-bomb on April 20,
1945. In a story on Nobel
prize winners the paper, in
referring to Arthur Holly
Compton, mentioned that he
and “his colleagues are work-
ing on the problem fraught
with tremendous possibili-
ties of releasing atomic
energy.”

Publication of the article
was one of nearly 2,000 cen-
sorship violations in regard
to the atom bomb reported
by The New Yorker maga-
zine on Oct. 27.

Hutchins9 Memo

Raps May Bill

Charges that the May-Johnson
atom-bomb bill, now in the senate,
would jeopardize American insti-
tutions, are contained in a six-
point memorandum which Chan-
cellor Robert M. Hutchins has
signed.

The memorandum, which is un-
derstood to embody Hutchins’ leg-
islative views, was drafted at a
meeting of twenty prominent
American educators and journal-
ists at Rye, New York, Oct. 28.
Among U. of C. representatives a!
the Rye conclave were Robert
Redfield, dean of the Social Sci-
ence Division, who served as chair-
man; Robert C. Gustavson, vice-
president of the University; and
Harold C. Urey, U. of C. Nobel
prize winning chemist.

“Stop Arms Race!”

Hutchins signed the memoran-
dum which said that the May-
Johnson bill will “jeopardize
American institutions, frustrate
the fundamental research neces-
sary to maintain American leader-
ship, set up authority responsible
to none, make it more difficult to
stop the present drift towards an
atomic armament race, make nor-
mal negotiation of international
agreements in the field more diffi-
cult, and interfere with attempts
to set up vitally necessary inter-
national controls.”

The bill provides for the estab-
lishment of a commission, presum-
ably to be headed by an army offi-
cial, which would have complete
control not only over military re-
search, but in scientific, medical,
and industrial fields as well.
Committe Proposals

In its stead, Hutchins and the
committee are understood to have
proposed the following:

1)	Appointment of a commission
and an administrator who would
be responsible to president and
congress, and removable by the
president in the same manner as a
cabinet officer.

2)	Secrecy regulations applicable
only to design features of plant
details of the atomic bomb, and
not to any scientific knowledge.

3)	Secrecy regulations should be
reviewed by a special cabinet com-
mission before promulgation.

4)	A commission should be re-
quired to provide sufficient mate-
rials for independent research, and
the commission should have no
power to control research.

5)	After an appropriate interval,
the commission must recommend
to Congress standards for govern-
ment regulation of industrial use
of atomic energy; until such time
as the Congress adopts regulations
the commission should not have
power to permit use of atomic
power for industrial use, although
research toward industrial use
should be permitted.

6)	Free exchange cf scientific
information with other United Na-
tions should be permitted.

Religious Round-up

CU in New
Probe Here
Of Fascism

Chapel Union announces that it
is continuing last spring’s study of
native American fascism.

Each Friday evening at 7 00
p.m., a group leaves from Chapel
House to attend meetings of the
Citizens’ USA Committee, a typi-
cal native fascist organization,
characterized by racial intoler-
ance, isolationism, red-baiting and
hate in general.

Meetings are held downtown in
Kimball Hall, and all those in-
terested in observing this type of
American fanaticism first-hand
may sign up at Chapel House and
report at the time indicated. Fol-
low-up discussions of the meetings
are held on Sunday evenings at 8
p.m. This Sunday, CU will have
as guest speaker, Leo Hurwicz, of
the Department of Economics, who
will discuss “Labor and Manage-
ment.”

Barn Dance Planned

CU also has a wiener roast and
barn dance planned for Thursday,
November 29, at the “point” in
Jackson Park. The group will
leave Chapel House at 5:00 pm.

At Calvert House, a discussion
meeting on Catholic theology and
on the writings of St. Thomas
Aquinas are being conducted by
Father Joseph Connerton. More
meetings on varied subjects are
being planned, and all interested
students may learn date and time
at Calvert House. Calvert has also
elected Pat Dillion its new acting
president, replacing Phil Reilly,
who has left the University.

Reception for Rabbi Kordis

Hillel Foundation will hold a
reception this Sunday for Rabbi
Robert Gordis, president of the
Rabbinical Assembly of America,
who will be speaker at the Rocke-
feller Chapel that morning. The
reception will be from 3:30 to
5:00 p.m. in the lounge at Karasik
House.

On Wednesday, November 28,
the final lecture in the Hillel series
will be given by Professor James
Luther Adams. The title of the
lecture is “Religion and Preju-
dice,” and it will also be held in
the lounge at Karasik House.

“Y” Speaker on Domestic Issues

The Y.M.C.A is currently mak-
ing plans for its Public Affairs
Luncheon, to be given Thursday at

Full Speed Ahead Here
On New Activity Plan

Here and There

In an effort to coordinate
student life a new College
House Plan has been put into
effect. “The object of this plan
is to enable any student in the
College to participate in one or
several of the various organiza-
tions which offer opportunities for
planned activities,” Alan Lake
Chidsey, new Assistant Dean of
Students asserted this week.

Chidsey pointed out that al-
though there have been many ob-
jections to the plan because of
apparent regimentation of stu-
dents; participation in the various
programs offered is not compul-
sory; no student is required to take
part who has neither the interest
nor time.

Organization Provides Recreation

“Each activity of the College
has been carefully planned in or-
der to make it not only pleasant
but worthwhile and educational,”
the Dean sa*id. “We realize the
physical incapacities of the Uni-
versity to provide adequate fa-
cilities for all students and we are
attempting to solve this problem.”

Under the plan a resident head,
who is either a faculty member
or a student, is in charge of each
house. This head acts as an ad-
visor, taking a personal interest
in the problems of each individ-
ual member. In addition to the
resident head, each house has also
an associate head and an athletic
advisor.

Plan Provides Special Training

Athletic activities are centered
in dormitory teams, with compe-
tent coaching and instruction in
various sports. Students can re-
ceive special training in any sport
in which they are interested.

“The office of the Dean of stu-
dents stands ready to recognize
any new student organization or
activity which presents a construc-
tive plan in consonance with Uni-
versity administrative policy and
which is predictive of a sufficient-
ly broad student participation to
guarantee its success,” Chidsey
stated. He also emphasized the im-
portance of veteran participation
in activities, expressing the opin-
ion that the. veteran should not
feel strange or out of place in his
contacts with younger students for
there are many in the same situ-
ation who have been away from
school for several years. He be-
lieves that if older students will
exert the influence of their ex-
perience it will be beneficial to all
students in the House Plan.

Organize to
Act Against
Intolerance

Disturbed by the recent racial
riots in the Chicago area and else-
where in the country, a group of
students from the various campus
organizations, have organized an
anti-discrimination committee.

The Anti-Discrimination Com-
mittee will be primarily concerned
with the investigation of and ac-
tion against discriminatory prac-
tices at the University. Action will
also be taken on off-campus
matters which are directly con-
cerned with the committee’s ac-
tivities.

Organizations which have thus
far sent official representatives to
the committee include the Maroon,
Labor Rights Society, American
Youth for Democracy, Socialist
Study Club, Negro Students Club,
YWCA, Bar Association, Calvert
Club, and the U. of C. local of the
United Office and Professional
Workers of America (CIO).

Independent students interested
in the committee are invited to
attend the meeting, held every
Tuesday at 8:30 P. M. at Ida Noyes
Hall.

Freedom . . .

(Continued from Page 1)
their researches and to publish
freely their discoveries. The Con-
stitution of the United States not
only granted freedom of speech
and of the press, but specifically
recognized the “progress of science
and useful arts” as a basic object
of American government.

“The successful application of
scientific knowledge to the devel-
opment of many devices of war-
fare, including the atomic bomb,
under conditions of rigid control,
has led to a widespread miscon-
ception that scientific research can
and should be permanently organ-
ized in this way. It should be
recognized that the growth of sci-
entific knowledge before the war
and the development of the men
who were responsible for its war-
time applications were only pos-
sible under conditions in which
uncensored communication of
ideas and unrestricted freedom of
research prevailed, permitting the
free play of scientific imagination.
Progress in nuclear studies and
the industrial and military appli-
cations of atomic energy will
wither at the root if the constant
influx of young men of the high-
est ability into the field is discour-
aged by such controls as have
been suggested in Congress. Na-
tional safety would be impaired,
not conserved.

“Moreover, nuclear studies occu-
py such a pivotal position in sci-
ence today that discoveries in this
field may be expected to revolu-
tionize many collateral branches
from anatomy to medicine. By
controlling nuclear research all
science may be shackled.

“We, therefore, respectfully urge
the Congress of the United States
to impose no restrictions on
teaching, research, or communica-
tion of the results of basic scien-
tific research (other than those
required to guard against hazards
to personal safety) and to pro-
mote individual research by such
measures as- are necessary to pro-
vide access to essential materials.

“Even if national control of
atomic energy is restricted to in-
dustrial and military applications,
we are concerned over the form
of control proposed in the May-
Johnson bill. We affirm our con-
viction that a public agency deal-
ing with atomic energy should be
subject to the usual control of the
Chief Executive, the Congress, and
the courts, and the traditional pre-
dominance of the civil over the
military authority should be jeal-
ously preserved.”

IBS Hookup for 4 Schools;
Classify Jobs at Normal U

Network radio broadcasting is
no longer a job for professionals
only. On November 12, four east-
ern Pennsylvania colleges will join
their student-run campus stations
in a permanent wire hookup. This
direct link will transmit a contin-
uous exchange of lectures, debates,
music, and sports between Swarth-
more, Haverford, Bryn Mawr, and
the University of Pennsylvania, all
members of the Inter-collegiate
Broadcasting System.

The new regional collegiate net-
work will be opened by Swarth-
more with a brief preview of the
outstanding features to be aired
during the coming months.

The hookup’s establishment was
foretold six months ago by the
first college network broadcast,
linking twelve IBS stations for an
hour-long program celebrating the
United Nations Conference. The
broadcast originated at Columbia
University, and student engineers
insist no ‘first’ network offering
was ever so technically flawless.

Before the war, college stations
were going on the air from Maine
to California. The IBS, a non-
profit organization, links all these
stations, and is cooperatively ad-
ministered by its members from
offices in New York. It offers
technical and programming advice
by mail and through field repre-
senatives.

Now that the war is over, IBS
is swamped with requests for in-
formation and help in getting col-
lege campuses all over the country
‘on the air.’

Student Employment

With labor problems taking the
national spotlight, the Student
Employment Office at Southern
Illinois Normal University, Car-
bondale, Ill*., has brought out a
constructive program for the clas-
sification of employment for stu-
dent workers.

Available campus jobs are
broken down into four classes ac-
cording to the type of work and
skill required, and a minimum
wage rate is set in each class. Pay
increases of 5 cents an hour nor-
mally are recommended for each
year of successful experience.

The system is designed to pro-
mote the efficiency of the workers,
equalize the amount of pay for the
amount of work accomplished, and
offer the student worker the op-
portunity to learn valuable skills
in connection with his job.

public service and educational
program on American radio” for
that year.

Probst, an alumnus of the Uni-
versity and a member of the Col-
lege faculty, was recently appoint-
ed head of the radio office. A
native of Hardtner, Kansas, he
will fill the post temporarily va-
cated by John P. Howe. Howe was
recently appointed executive as-
sistant to Assistant Secretary of
State Wiliam Benton, who was
formerly a vice-president of the
University.

Probst has been associated with
the radio office since 1939 when
he graduated from the University.
Twenty-eight years old, he is a
third generation alumnus of the
University of Chicago, his grand-
father obtained his medical de-
gree here and his father a law
degree. He has two daughters,
Patricia, 3, and Barbara, 1.

Discover Two
New Elements

Two new elements, numbers 95
and 96, have been added to the
expanding periodic table by Dr.
Glenn T. Seaborg, University of
California Professor of Chemistry,
working at the Metallurgical La-
boratory of the University of Chi-
cago.

Dr. Seaborg’s announcement,
made last Friday, follows closely
the disclosure this summer that
elements 94, plutonium, of which
he was a co-discoverer, had been
added to the known elements in
1940 and used in atomic bomb
manufacture.

He announced discovery of the
two yet unnamed elements at the
fiftieth aniversary technical con-
ference of the Chicago section of
the American Chemical Society at
Northwestern University.

At the same time he also dis-
closed that plutonium, first dis-
covered in the laboratory, has been
found to exist in minute amounts
in a natural state—the first in- '
stance in which a man-made ele-
ment was necessary to prove its
existence in nature. Along with
this disclosure was the announce-
ment of discovery by Dr. Seaborg
and a co-worker, Arthur C. Wahl,
of neptunium 237, a new isotope or
twin of element 93, neptunium.
The newly discovered isotope has a
half-life of two million years and
is therefore relatively stable in
comparison with the first known
form, neptunium 239, which has a
half-life of 2.3 days.

Elements 95 and 96 were found
as a result of the bombardment of
uranium 238, the abundant isotope
of uranium, and plutonium 239
with high energy helium ions, or
alpha particles, of 40 million elec- .
tron volts in Professor Ernest Law-
rence’s cyclotron at Berkley, Cal-
ifornia. The chemical identification
studies were conducted in the Met-
allurgical Laboratory.

With the many chemists working
with him on plutonium at the
Metallurgical Laboratory, “A large
number of compounds of pluton-
ium have been prepared and their
properties determined, and it is
fair to say that the chemistry of
plutonium today is as well under-
stood as, or better understood
than is that of most of the ele-
ments in the periodic system,” Dr.
Seaborg said in his paper.

The general conclusions from
work on plutonium and neptun-
ium are that these two elements
are similar in chemical properties
to uranium, with an increase in
stability of the lower oxidation
states in going toward plutonium.

Fraternities

In the interests of impartiality, the editorial columns of THE
CHICAGO MAROON have been opened, at the invitation of the
editor, to the Inter-fraternity Council. The official reply of the
Council to Editor Abe Krash’s editorial last week follows in full:

The decision of the University to preserve the fraternity
system at the University of Chicago will, we think, prove
wise. We are grateful for the administration’s praise of fra-
ternities’ contribution to the University and we accept the
invitation of the university to project fraternity life in accord-
ance with the University’s new program. The loyalty of the fraterni-
ties now, as always, is first to the University and we shall act in com-
plete accord with the University’s policies.

We realize the necessity of giving proper supervision to those
who come into the first two years of the college at a very early age.

In permitting fraternities to pledge men in the last two years of the
college through the winter quarter of 1947 we think the University
has been wise for this will permit the fraternities to remain in the
College framework until the University has had a year and a halt
to experiment with the House Plan. Should that time reveal that a
place remains for fraternities in the last two years of the college
neither the University nor the fraternities will have sustained the
loss that would have resulted had the fraternities been limited to
the divisions immediately.

We feel that there is a point in a young man’s life when he reaches
the place where he must begin to make his own decisions. This is
recognized by the University, itself, in dropping the supervision of
young men in the last two years of the college. This same fact is re-
cognized by the draft policy of the armed services. It is our feeling
that the University is trying to develop self-sufficient, independent
students, able to hold their own not only scholastically but also to
meet whatever problem life presents. We are inclined to believe that
all youngsters arrive at this age at approximately eighteen—the third
year of the college—and that the University does such students no
particular service by guiding them during this third and fourth year
of the college, desirable as this may be during the first two years.
Should this prove to be so in the light of experience with the House
Plan it may be that the administration will wish to modify its ruling
with reference to fraternities in the third and/or fourth years of the
college.

Should it develop that the Fraternities are to operate at only the
divisional level the type of fraternity life will probably undergo
changes of a kind desirable to satisfy the more mature point of view
of its members, and thus the fraternities will still render a valuable
service to campus life. If it eventuates that fraternities will be com-
posed of men of the divisions, supplemented by men of the third
and/or fourth years of the college, it will be a desirable development
because association with men working for the Masters Degree will
benefit the scholastic work and cultural development of men in the
college.

It may be that the Administration should give thought to
the fact that should fraternities be abolished in the college the
last link with the alumni to the University is severed. At most
other Universities the alumnus maintains a strong contact
with the University through his fraternity, or his class, or his
sports affiliation.

Of these three strong alumni pulls at Chicago none would remain.

The University of Chicago being endowed and not tax supported
has a particular need for alumni financial support. Since the existing
tax system means that there will be no more really wealthy men the
contributions to the University will have to come—in part—annually
from many loyal alumni in comparatively small amounts. If the alum-
nus has active connections with the University he is likely to con-
tribute. *

From the following we draw no conclusion: The University of
Chicago has about 50,000 alumni. Of these about 5,000—10 per cent—
contribute annually to the University. Dartmouth, which is strong
in Fraternities, strong in its Class System, and strong in Sports, re-
ceives contributions annually from more than eighty per cent of its
alumni.

At the last meeting of the representatives of the Board of Trustees
and the Administration with the Fraternities the point was made
by the University representatives that the present decision of the
Administration was not necessarily final—but rather is subject to re-
vision in the light of the University’s experience with the House
Plan,

Iowa Editor
Sees Heed
For UC Plan

Technical training is inadequate
for the modern world the editor
of the Iowa State Daily Student
said this week in a signed edi-
torial.

He urged grounding students in
“liberal arts” even in “technologi-
cal” Iowa State.

His editorial follows:

The statement, “A college should
turn out students that are more
than just trained technicians/4
arrested our attention the other
day.

It started us to thinking that
that fact alone justifies “activities”
for college students.

Iowa State, one of the most
efficient, highly rated technical
institutions in the nation, certainly
can start looking in her own front
yard. Have you ever figured how
many of our approximately 4,000
students take part in activities?
How many students learn to de-
velop and present their own ideas
and do it well enough to actually
convince an audience?

The Iowa State ‘Debaters, one
activity which gives a student the
opportunity to stand on his own
two feet, do his own thinking and
present a case without a severe
condition of knockikneetis (symp-
toms of knocking knees) count an
average of 20 students.

. .Publications, the foremost ac-
tivities on campus, draw a hand-
ful of responsible people when
they need many times their pres-
ent staffs to carry on the work
which they are inherently capable.

The League of Student Opinion
died. We suspect it was not so
much the lack of interest as the
inability of the average student on
the Iowa State campus to express
himself, and his understandable
reticence about trying it.

The argument that more ac-
tivities are needed to take care of
the increasing enrollment can’t
stand in view of the fact that
present activities are under-en-
rolled and the average college
student is disinterested.

The college needs to give its
students much more in liberal
background. Without the forma-
tion of a fundamental philosophy,
the student might as well be a
robot turned loose in a world
made up of human beings. If he
has nothing more than a technical
understanding to offer the people
with whom he works, he can’t
hope to be advanced to responsible
executive positions. Neither can
he expect to put over the ideas
his technical superiority may have
furnished him.

Until the college takes steps to
remedy this, as could be done in
making such curriculum as en-
gineering a five-year-curriculum,
with the first year given to laying
a cultural background, activities
remain the only place where a
student can develop qualities of
leadership.

Iowa Staters, if they are to hold
there reputation and respect now
accorded the school, will have to
develop culturally as well as
scientifically. For, though it may
be an easy moral to attach to edi-
torials these days, certainly these
are the times when human intelli-
gence and understanding are need-
ed by more people and to a greater
degree than they have ever been
needed before.

But which of the indispensable readings are required?

Letter-Writers Rap

Commons, MAROON

Can you not bring to the at-
tention of the University public
the very unfortunate misuse of the
Hutchinson Commons dining
room? This room, which was in-
tended for the use of members of
the Universify, is being used in-
creasingly by workmen and busi-
ness people from 55th st., 53rd st.,
63rd st., and even by those beyond
63rd st. Those who have been
watching the situation feel that
perhaps one-third of those too
enormous crowds that jam the
dining room and make enjoyment
of the beautiful room and the ex-
cellent meals impossible, is com-
posed of people who have not now,
never have had, and never will,
have any connection with this uni-
versity or with any other.

Among those noted in the ever
lengthening lines are small shop
dealers from 55th st., beauty par-
lor operators from 53rd st., typists
from 63rd st., handy men who do
odd jobs in the neighborhood
(both white and black) and
other jobbers as well as some
recognized laboring men. Since
many of these people have not the
slightest interest in education, and
since all tables seat many persons,
university people are constantly
dining with those who chance to
come in to take advantage of the
conditions that the university has
provided for its members, and are
cut off from the great advantage
of meeting other university people.
No Right to Commons

It would seem that these work-
men and business people have no
more right to the use of the
Commons than they have to the
use of the Quadrangle Club if
they found it more to their liking
then the hotels of the neighbor-
hood. Not only are the at-
mosphere and the social possibili-
ties of the Commons spoiled by
the non-university element, but
again and again it has been noted
that university people, discourged
by the long line, have left the
Commons and gone elsewhere foi
a meal, perhaps to the public
cafeterias and new cafes now
opening on near-by business sts.,
with the outsiders enjoying the
Commons.

The whole difficulty could easi-
ly be taken care of by placing a
placard on a standard, by the
menu—standard, at the entrance
to the cafeteria. This placard
could read:

This cafeteria is for the exclu-
sive use of those connected with
the university and their guests.
Do not enter unless you have a
registration receipt or can produce
a library card.

Notice to Discourage Outsiders

Such a notice would not ex-
clude alumni of the university,

former faculty members, or visit-
ing faculty members. But it would
exclude those who are merely
working in the neighborhood and
are pushing university people out
of a place which they are entitled
to enjoy. With such a placard
displayed, the manager would be
in a position to challenge anyone
who seemed not a legitimate user
of the Commons. But many out-
siders and they number in the
hundreds, would doubtless be dis-
couraged from coming, as hap-
pened when a similar sign was set
up at International House some
years ago.

Editor Advocated
'Collectivism*

In its application of unity, one-
ness of intent and action, as the
solution to the critical problems
facing us, the MAROON has en-
croached upon the prerogative of
the individual. Such mass col-
lectivism as is advocated is far
indeed from the solution of our
problems which, in the American
society, are resolved through the
meeting and interchange of op-
possing and contrasting points of
view.

Through such a function the fra-
ternity justifies itself. Individuals
who share common beliefs are en-
abled to join together with fellow
students and friends in an organi-
zation in which they can express
those beliefs. Every fraternity
possesses a different facet of in-
tellectual and social life through
which its members, as individuals,
find a richer university experi-
ence.

In refutation of the charge of
triviality, one has only to observe
the spirit animating fraternity life
to realize that such is not the case.
Upon consideration of the
“shackles of anti-intellectualism,
discrimination, and snobbishness,”
which are inferred to be charac-
teristic of fraternities, one finds
throughout the country that fra-
ternity men have higher scholastic
averages than the student body
as a whole, and that they are
known on the .campuses for their
wide number of friends, and posi-
tions of social and extra-curricu-
lar leadership. It is one of the
aims of fraternity life to develop
such attainments of a well-round-
ed person.

The salient points constituting,
“a crushing indictment against
the fraternity system everywhere,”
as listed by the Editor, would seem
to exist only in his mind, for they
die not characteristic of the sys-
tem as it exists elsewhere.

Compared to last year’s the-
atrical faux pas, The Players
Guild production of WINTER-
SET appears to be at least one
step in the right direction. The
staging of Mr. Anderson’s po-
etic drama is careful and effec-
tive, and it’s difficult to imagine
how the actors could have cre-
ated any kind of mood without

it.

On the other hand, much awed
by the sound of Mr. Anderson’s
third-rate verse, the cast didn’t
seem to realize it was playing sure-
fire melodrama with slow-motion
technique. At best WINTERSET is
a long play, and without plenty of
well timed action we are apt to

lapse into a most unfortunate state
of boredom—possibly why neither
the poetry nor the drama was very
impressive last Friday night.

Frame-up is Detailed

Mr. Anderson’s poetic rearrange-
ment of the famous Sacco-Vanzetti
case is too complicated to give in
much detail here. It seems that ten
years before the curtain rises
Trock Estrella, in the company of
Shadow and Garth Esdras, mur-
dered a paymaster. A gentleman
named Romagna was brought to
trial instead of Trock and was
sentenced to death by Judge
Gaunt. Romagna’s son Mio, con-
vinced that his father was inno-
cent, has spent his life waiting for
the opportunity to prove it. Be-
cause someone has written a pam-
phlet about the trial, and has
asserted that Garth Esdras should
have been called as witness, Mio
has come to New York to talk to

The System for Women’s dormitories this

dorms are now arranged so that the first and

the third and fourth year women on the lower

each commuter has been asso-

'Winterset' Is Billed
Again This Weekend
WINTERSET will be pre-
sented in Mandel Hall to-
night and Saturday night
under the auspices of the
Players Guild. Tickets for
Maxwell Anderson’s well
known poetic drama are
available at the box-office in
the Mandel Hall corridor.
The all student cast, headed
by Sylvia Farnham and
Philip Kirton will give its
third performance tonight at
8:30 p.m.

Garth. He meets Garth’s sister,
Mariamne, and the two fall in love.
Mio, Trock, and Gaunt, all haunted
by this case, meet in the Esdras
home. Gaunt’s insistence on his
fairness, and Garth’s fear of tell-
ing the truth distresses Mio. But
when Trock finally gives himself
away, Mio is prevented from tell-
ing the police because Miriamne
is afraid her brother will be sent
to jail. The ending—well there is
no point in spoiling it.

Marvin Peisner who directed
WINTERSET, and is playing the
part of Judge Gaunt, would prob-
ably have sped up the action of the
second act considerably had he
been in a position to watch his
own scenes. I’m afraid I didn’t
quite see the point in leaving the
stage empty for minutes at a time,
although that might be just per-
sonal prejudice.

Acting Smooth, not Forceful

On the whole the acting was
smooth, but not what could be
termed forceful. Mr. Peisner cre-
ated a believable and consistent
judge, and regardless of my ob-
jections to his directing, I have
none to make of his excellent char-
acter portrayal. Philip Kirton got
along rather well with Mio, after
a few stiff moments at first. He has
handled a difficult part convinc-
ingly, and will no doubt improve
as he plays it a third and fourth
time. Malcolm Provus as Garth
and George Morrison as Esdres
were both a little muddled and on
the undistinguished side, although
they too will feel at ease as they
get more experience. Herbert Baer

WALTER BARTKY

Walter Bartky, former acting
Dean of the Division of the Physi-
cal Sciences and authority on
astronomy, mathematics, and prob-
ability, has been appointed Dean,
after the resignation of Dr. Arthur
Holly Compton. Dean Bartky is a
University of Chicago product, and
says happily, “I have been here
all my life,” speaking of the Uni-
versity and of the city of Chicago.
He comes from a long line of Chi-
cagoans.

The new Institutes of Nuclear
Studies and Metals will be in the
Division of the Physical Sciences
under his supervision. Professor
Samuel K. Allison will be the di-
rector.

From Student to Professor at U. C.

Bartky received his B. S. here
in 1923, and his Ph.D. in 1926.
Before receiving his doctorate,

Trock and Shadow with a fine

about them that was quite striking.

Sylvia Farnham made a sweet
Miriamne, but she poses more
questions in her conception of this
young girl than she answers. Char-
acters reacted to what she said or
didn’t say, but I wasn’t impressed
with the probability. It appears
that Miramne was underplayed to
the point of meekness, and was
for that reason at times without
motive for what she did.

Neur Steals Scenes

Herbert Neur, who played the
hobo stole a good many of the
scenes he was in. Jean Cooke and
Roberta Unger made very colorful
and lively prostitutes. I liked

Initiating a new phase in the
dormitory system, Dean Law-
rence A. Kimpton will visit Bur-
ton-Judson Court to teach a great
books course. Together with Mr.
Wilkinson, head of the 700 entry,
and Kimpton’s associate in a great
books course taught at the Uni-
versity College, he presented Pla-
to’s Crito and Apology in the first
class Tuesday evening.

The couse is being taught at the
request of a group of students in
the dormitory, who are asking for
closer contact between faculty and
students and for further stimula-
tion of intellectual life within the
dormitory. The class will continue
on Tuesdays at 7:30 P.M. in the
Burton Library throughout the
Fall and Winter quarters.

That Fountain Again

Some time in September three or four public spirited young
damsels began to lay plans for something new, something dif-
ferent, which would involve great labor on the part of B. & G.
In deep secrecy they collected boxes of jello, gelatin, and any-
thing else that would jell and laid them aside for the com-
ing of cold weather. They also made a goodly collection of
kettles, suitable for the transport of large quantities of boiling
water. In short, they planned to make a vast jello mold in the
Hutchinson Court fountain. Somehow their scheme became
known to various and sundry groups on campus who took
up the idea energetically and in turn collected jello them-
selves. The idea became so popular and widespread (each
group, of course, believing itself sole originator) that the
other day one of the original founders was asked, “Wouldn’t
it be a wonderful idea to fill up the fountain and Botany Pond
with jello?” And now the latest rumor is that the Nu Pi’s
are planning to serve up the jello with whipped cream in the
Commons.

Social Life

We report sadly that IF Ball was not quite official this year—
there was no Sigma cocktail party before or after the dance. . . .
Another era ended? Beecher and Green threw open house Sunday
and reportedly snared several new men. . . . Most of the elder brothers
of Psi U missed their own hayride last Friday—apparently they
were detained at the hospital; however, their absence was made
up for by guests, King and Drennan. Afterwards, Dorothy Clapp
and Duval Jaros outdid themselves polkaing and square dancing,
. . . The ordinarily staid Art Club got itself in an auto accident the
other day—too much tea?

* ♦ *

Is Boyer Passe?

The 9th floor of Int. House (strictly female) furnishes us with an
amusing story, doubtless typical of the times. It seems one of our
usually reliable informants had been playing bridge until the late
hours; about two, as she was returning to her 11th floor domicile,
clad in not much more than a slip and blouse (the latter thrown
over her shoulders), she ran into a debonair young man in brown
tweeds sauntering blithely up the stairs. She fled and, presently re-
covering from the shock, she ventured over to the john. As she was
brushing her teeth, she got that peculiar feeling of someone staring at
her. She turned and saw nothing except that one of the john doors
was closed. She tiptoed over, pushed the door, and, lo, it was locked.
Frantically she peered under the door—no feet! Panic-stricken she
ran out and just as she went out she looked back—and there, peer-
ing over the door, was a pair of flashing masculine eyes. Are we to
gather that bedroom eyes, as exemplified by M. Boyer, are being re-
placed by bathroom eyes?

Around Campus

People are still picking leaflets campaigning for P. J. Murphey
as Miss U. of C. out of the nooks and crannies of Lying-In. The plane
chartered to drop them on campus strewed a magnificient total of
15 on campus and the rest fell on Lyin-In. Carol Gray had a won-
derful (she says) visit in Norfolk with Jim McGiffin, Judy Held
and Earl Isbell are engaged. P. J. Murphey Was just pinned to Don
McBride. Sigma had a tea at Dorothy Duft Johnson’s Sunday; in-
cidentally, Sigma celebrated its fifteenth anniversary this year.

Danseuse Manning Is
Producing Results

When Alan Lake Chidsey, Assistant Dean of Students, proposed
an all-student night club, he got an enthusiastic supporter in the Uni-
versity’s modern dance director, Katherine Manning.

Coming from the professional
world herself, Miss Manning is
naturally excited about the pos-
sibilities of an outlet for her tal-
ented dancers. For the night club,
Coach Er vin Beyer, who has been
conducting classes in acrobatics
and adagio, and Miss Manning
would combine techniques and
work on an act for the floor show.

As a youngster, Miss Manning
had the opportunity to work with
the famous dancing group of Ruth
St. Denis in New York. Actually,
her formal training was slight; she
was doing interpretive dancing be-
fore anything known as such ex-
isted as an established form of the
dance. Miss Manning was with
Charles Widiman and Doris Hum-
phreys when they broke away
from the St. Denis-Shaw method
to form the first specific “modern
dance” group.

“They only wanted me as a
guinea pig to try out their new
experiments,” confided Miss Man-
ning. She was, however, their pre-

miere danseuse, and remained that
for the thirteen years she was with
them.

After that came summers which
were “Cook’s tours” of American
universities. A Skidmore graduate
herself, Miss Manning has since
taught at Michigan University,
Louisiana State University, and
Temple. Dancing in festivals at
both Mills College in Oakland and
Bennington in Vermont, she final-
ly camped midway between the
two on the Chicago campus.

Since 1939, when Miss Manning
began teaching here, she has seen
the modern dance group grow in
size as well as importance.

“What I would like to see is a
combination of the facilities of the
dance, drama, and music depart-
ments to produce something that
would be really worthwhile,” Miss
Manning said. “Teaching the girls
how to dance is almost like teach-
ing a young colt how to run. But,
frankly, I love it.”

Cloisters Re-open

The Cloister Club in Ida Noyes
Hall was re-opened Monday, Oc-

used exclusively by the Navy. The
cafeteria is open Monday through
Friday for luncheon from 11:30
until 1:30, and for dinner from
5:30 until 6:45. The soda fountain
is open in the afternoon from

Last week, this column, On The Beam, wasn’t on the beam
when one of its paragraphs read: “Their living brother stu-

of the Gary race hate “strike” of

Watching the typical American
student, in the film, succumb to
and accept ideals diametrically op-
posed to the very attributes that
made him an American, you could
feel the power of the evil that was
at work. An evil that would split
man from man, brother from
brother the world over—and you
knew the necessity to fight that
power. For here was Fascism in
its American manifestation, at
work in terms of human beings,
not in terms of words set down
on paper. Here was a conscious
force that has as its aim the main-
tenance of human subjection—by
force and violence. Here was some-
thing that could make you mad
again, and the decent human be-
ing finds it difficult to harbor

thinking this battle, morning, day
and night, every day of the year.

Democracy is not a right or a
privilege that can be magnan-

however large, upon a minority,
however small. Democracy in its
fullest meaning has no existence

into democracy by being given
every possible opportunity to en-

It is not pleasant to have your

you who have life, freedom and

By your actions, definitely, a cer-

then, sure as fate, you will save
the lives of some men, who will

Till lynching stops, till Negroes

Okay Changes in
College Courses

In line with a constant effort to
improve the course of studies
offered in the College, several
changes in the curriculum have
been made.

For students who begin in the
first year of the College, a new
three-year Natural Sciences course,
based on one year of mathematics,
will replace the general courses
in the Biological and Physical
Sciences now offered. Physics
and chemistry will be studied in
the first year, biology in the sec-
ond year, and both during the
third year.

Revisions have been made in the
Social Science II course. The
problem of equality and inequality
in modern society is the unifying
theme and the first quarter will
be devoted to a study of various
concepts necessary for an under-
standing of modern society. Such
basic works as Malthus, Essay on
Population; Freud, Civilization and
Its Discontent; Dewey, Human
Nature and Conduct; Maine, An-

Ph.D., and a year later was made
assistant professor. Five years
later he became associate profes-
sor, and in 1942, full professor of
applied mathematics and Associate
Dean of the Division of Physical
Sciences.

No new associate dean has been
appointed.

This quarter Bartky is teaching
Math. 392 (Celestial Mechanics)

Old timers who remember
the days when the University
of Chicago still participated in
inter-collegiate football will re-
member the name of Bill Leach.
His drop-kick against Oberlin
College in 1939 was the last point
made in football by a U. of C
team. It was the same Bill Leach,
a major with the 101st Air Borne
Division, who parachuted into
Normandy on D-Day and latei
fought in the battle of Bastogne.
On April 13, 1945, Major Leach
was killed in action on a volunteer
mission crossing the Rhine with an
intelligence patrol.

Recently a number of Big Ten
schools have been agitating for a
return of the freshman ineligibility
rule under which no freshman is
permitted to participate in inter-
collegiate athletics. The issue has
become hot enough to rank as one
of the main topics of discussion at
the forthcoming Big Ten Winter
Athletic Meeting. If the opinion of
J. Kyle Anderson, assistant athle-
tic director, represents the attitude
of the University, Chicago can be
counted on to vote against re-
voking the present rule until at
least July 1, 1946. Coach Anderson
fears the confusion that would re-
sult from a mid-year change of the
rules. We concur.

A word of congratulations to the
athletic department. The new in-
tra-mural system, working thru
the organization of the men’s
dorms, is a whopping big success.
Fellows who are incapable of play-
ing on varsity teams are being af-
forded an opportunity they would
otherwise have missed. No sooner
did the football season end than
basketball began. Table-tennis and
swimming tournaments are sched-
uled for the next couple of weeks;
other activities are to be an-
nounced later. The University’s
emphasis on athletics for the sake
of the participants has become
more than mere lip-service.

Critic Is Delayed

The CRITIC, official student

appearance on November 30, has

The entire student body will
assemble in the circle of the Quad-
rangles on Friday, November 30
at 8 p.m., for a huge pep rally and
bonfire. This rally will be spon-
sored by the Student Athletic
Promotion committee to celebrate
the opening of the basketball sea-
son the following night, Decem-

For the first time this year the
band, under the direction of Arpad
Elo will perform. There will be
yells, cheers and chants led by
the varsity cheerleading squad
captained by Ann Bokman. The
cheerleaders, ten beautiful girls,
have been practicing under Gym-
nastic Coach Bud Beyer, since
October. Gerhard Schroth will
lead the crowd in University
songs.

“Our tentative plans,” said John
Horton, chairman of the commit-
tee, “include the presentation of
Miss Gloria Jean of Hollywood,

There seems to be a twinkle in
the eyes of the members of the
athletic staff this year at the men-
tion of basketball. It’s not be-
cause they are expecting a cham-
pionship or anything very close
to it; it’s just that they have what
all coaches dream of, a team with
spirit and a powerful liking for
the game.

Twenty-six Men Out

Twenty-six men are working
out every afternoon under the able
direction of Coaches Norgren and
Anderson. Although there are
only four returning lettermen:
Fred DeGraw, George Raby, John
Sharp and Almond Lilien, the
team is strengthened by the height
of Steve Ellison, the accuracy of
Ray Freeark and Wallis Riley,
and the speed of Lowell Walker
and Fred King. Those with the
solid backing of Bradley, Goedeke,

Football reluctantly bowed out
of the intra-mural spotlight last
week to make room for house
basketball. Helmets and cleated
shoes were stowed away for an-
other year as all eight houses from
Burton-Judson court sent repre-
sentatives to the opening practice
session last Monday afternoon.

Athletic department officials al-
so announced last week plans for
a round-robin basketball tourna-
ment for divisional and profes-
sional students to begin January
16. Entries must be turned into
the athletic office by January 7.

The house cage league, open to
all male students in the college
whether they live in a men’s dorm
or not, isn’t to begin actual play
until January 15. However, the
practice schedule calls for coach-
ing in the fundamentals commenc-
ing last Monday and ending on
December 7. At that time the
league will disband temporarily to
await the opening of the Winter
quarters.

went on to say that the bonfire
will be constructed of four tele-
phone pole sections in the form of
a square with kindling piled in the
center.

A public address system and a
lighting system will be installed
so that the crowd can see the fes-
tivities. Highlight of the evening
will be the burning of an effigy of
Illinois Tech’s basketball team fol-
lowed by a snake dance around
the campus.

Morgan, Nery, Pipenbrink, Sar-
gent, Schlossberg, Schneider,
Beard, Rifas, Howard Janetopous,
Franke, Bouscia, Blumberg, Fink
and Fisher, should make a good
team lacking only a little in ex-
perience and height.

Athletic Promotion Committee

The Student Athletic Promotion
Committee, under the chairman-
ship of John Horton, is planning
a big publicity campaign for the
winter quarter, including bonfires
between-the-halves entertainment,
and dances. The first action of
the committee is the arranging of
a grand opening pep rally and
bonfire for the basketball season
to be held November 30 in the
circle.

On the schedule for entertain-
ment will be the University of
Chicago band playing the old Chi-

In Intradural Duel

The 1945 swimming season starts off with a big splash on
December 4 with squads from all eight Burton-Judson houses

competing against each other for the intra-mural title.

Already some of the mer-men are taking advantage of the
coaching being offered every afternoon by varsity mentor Me-

Gillivray. However, there is still

plenty of time remaining for any-
one who desires to compete to sig-
nify his intention of doing so. Al!
male students in the college, pro-
vided they have a satisfactory
health rating and provided they do
not have a major letter in swim-
ming, are eligible to participate.
Practice is held every day in the
Bartlett gym natatorlum from
3:30 to 4:30 p.m.

Don Shields

Memo to Women's Honor

Clubs: Reorganize Now!

Famed Harpsichordist

To Play Here Nov. 30

Yelia Pessl, eminent harpsichordist, will be presented in
recital on the third of the University Concerts series on Fri-
day, November 30, at 8:30 p.m., in Mandel Hall.

Assisted by Harvey Noack, flautist, and Dudley Powers,
violincellist, first-desk players from the Chicago Symphony,
Miss Pessl will present a program of eighteenth century mu-
sic.

With Mr. Noack and Mr. Powers, Miss Pessl will play the
Trio en concert No. 3 by Charles Dieupart (1707-1740), a
little known French composer, some of whose music Johann
Sebastian Bach is believed to have studied and the fifth in
a set of five Pieces de clavecin en concerts by Jean-Philippe
Rameau, the greatest French classical master.

If you’ve ever taken the trouble to identify
the array of club and/or fraternity pins worn
by some of our campus people, you may have
noticed a young lady or two sporting what
appeared to be a small gold goat’s head.

Well, it was a goat’s head and it proclaims
the wearer a member of Nu Pi Sigma, the Sen-
ior Women’s Honorary Society. Through cus-
tom and convention Nu Pi ceased being an
academic honorary years ago.

The group’s change, however, from a purely
academic honor to a forum was one that both-
ered nobody. Even after the change there were
never found in Nu Pi the ugly racial and re-
ligious prejudices prevailing in many of the
social clubs. Election was determined by
leadership in the more important social and
service organizations and was not restricted
to those who were merely white, gentile, and
affiliated with a club. In short, Nu Pi was re-
spected and supported by the student body
because it represented intelligent student
opinion from all sections of the campus.

In the past two or three years, however, our
Senior Women’s Honorary has been under-
going another change which is turning the
organization, as one member put it the other

day, into nothing more than an exclusive sup-
per club. The strong leadership that was once
the hallmark of Nu Pi is now practically non-
existent. The individual members themselves
are still sincere, intelligent girls, but no more
than three or four of them can, by any stretch
of the imagination, be called student leaders.

Time was when Nu Pi meetings were forums
for the discussion of important student prob-
lems. Nowadays the members sit around and
wonder vaguely what can be done about
“school spirit.” Formerly the Nu Pi well un-
derstood that “school spirit” js something that
is never lacking on any college campus, but
that purpose and direction for this “spirit”
were frequently absent. They also understood
that the traditional function of their organi-
zation was to provide this purpose and direc-
tion. And provide it they did because they had
the respect of the campus at large.

Today not one student in ten has ever heard
of a Senior Women’s Honorary, and this is not
because Nu Pi has maintained its tradition of
careful avoidance of all publicity, but simply
because it has had nothing significant to offer
the campus. It’s about time the good ladies set
about re-organizing their group.
