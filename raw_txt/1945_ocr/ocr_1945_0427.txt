Hayek Rips Liberal Plan For Full Postwar Employment

Tell* Scheme for Germany In

Interview With Maroon

By ALAN J. STRAUSS and JOAN KOHN

Blasting the “so-called planners” who favor the
piaintainence of boom-time levels of maximum employ-
ment by means of government spending, Friedrich A.
Hayek yesterday declared at Mandel Hall that such a
policy was incompatible both with a stable high level
of employment in a free society and with the liberal
order in which the present generation professes to
believe. As a means for insuring economic stability,
he proposed instead a long-range policy of increasing
the resources devoted to the production of consumer
goods at the expense of those now invested in the

capital goods industries.

Delivering the last in a series of three lectures
the author of the controversial “The Road to Serfdom”
agreed that government action was essential to a high
level of employment, but asserted that he could not
agree with the policies advocated, presumably, by the
group whose slogan is “Full Employment”—the group

Charles E. Merriam answers Hayek. See story on Page 3.

headed in the political arena by Henry Wallace.

The fiery author told The Chicago Maroon, in an
exclusive interview that the Allies “cannot impose
a government on Germany.” The celebrated economist
declined to comment on the San Francisco conference
and smilingly said “I am no prophet.”

Hayek delivered three lectures at Mandel Hall be-
foreaudiences that included economists from the en-

tire region.

The noted professor of the London School of Econ-
omics, based his opposition to this practical policy of
“pump-priming”, as practiced by the New Deal, on his
disagreement with the theory underlying it—the theory
that underconsumption of consumer goods at the peak
of a prosperity period initiates the deflationary spiral
leading to depression and unemployment. As an alter-
native to this explanation, whose chief champions are
John Maynard Keynes in England and Alvin W. Han-
sen in this country, he proposed that a maldistribution
of resources, with too-heavy emphasis on capital goods
industries is the real cause of economic instability.

Hayek concluded that government spending could
not restore private investment, and that any jobs

Sought by UC

Famed Scientist Resigns to
Take Washington U. Post

Arthur H. Compton, Dean of
Physical Sciences since 1940 and
internationally eminent scientist,
yesterday tendered his resigna-
tion to the Board of Trustees to
accept a position as Chancellor of
Washington University in St.
Louis.

A swirl of rumors as to his possible
successor followed Compton’s surprise
resignation. The renowned scientist,
winner of the Nobel prize, has been
associated with the Department of
Physics of the University for 23 years.

The office of the President an-
nounced that Compton’s resignation
has been received. It is expected that
he will be offered his release shortly.

Well-informed observers have re-
vealed that it is not yet known who
will be or whether the replacement
will be made from the faculty of the
division.

Compton has been linked with a
number of University presidential
chairs in the last several years. Wash-
ington was the scene of his first
professorship in 1920.

Compton’s long and brilliant career
reads like the story of science during
the past 25 years. In addition to the
Nobel award, granted him for his
discovery that energy is actually mat-
ter, he has won 7 gold medals for out-

Universities have conferred honorary
degrees upon him.

He has lectured throughout the

U. of C. Women Are Labeled

“Mine eyes are dim, I cannot see, I have not brought my specs

With this poetic comment the Gei-

of Japanese at the University, opened

the results of an extensive investiga-

Two-Day Anti-Bigotry
Conference To Open
Here Saturday Night

A two-day public probe of discrimination as a potential threat
to America’s future will be carried out here, Saturday and Sunday
in a two-day anti-bigot conference sponsored by Labor Rights and
the United States Student Assembly.

Aubrey C. Williams, a stern petrol of the American progres-
sive movement, will be the conference’s keynote speaker, Saturday
night at 8 p.m. in Leon Mandel Hall. Second and third sessions of
the Conference will be held at the First Unitarian Church Parish
House, 57th and Woodlawn.

Chief aim of the two-day program is outlining bases for future
action in attacking bigotry in all phases of American life.

Religious and labor organizations are participating with Labor

Rights, campus left wing political or-
ganization, in sponsoring the program
which features a score of prominent
midwest liberals.

Williams* address will be the first
gun in the two-day speaking barrage.
His address will be followed by a pan-
el of well known labor and religious
leaders.

On Sunday, three afternoon panels
are scheduled. The first, at 2 p.m.,
will focus attention on discrimination
in jobs and will include a discussion of
bans now enforced against Negroes,
Jews, Mexicans and Veterans. At
3:30 p.m., housing will be a subject
of a panel and at 5 p.m., education

A new figure, “D.H.R.,” has entered
the bout with the following comment:
‘Many times have the American
women been called ‘the most beautiful
and gracious in the world’; but I am
sure that the appreciation expressed
therein would pall under the terrify-
ing experience of so many Rabelaisian
monstrosities.

Some of the dormitory girls have
sided with the A.S.T.P. as evidenced
by the comment of Tee Gaber of
Green Hall who feels that “we just
dress for men anyhow so they have
a perfect right to tell us what they

Chapel has been planned by an all
student committee to be held when
word is flashed that hostilities have
ended in Europe.

Classes will be suspended through-
out the University from 10:30 to noon.
The program at the Chapel will begin
about 10:40 and will include the ad-

India. He recently served as chair-

Born in Wooster, Ohio, Sept. 10,
1892, Compton, son of a philosopher,
was a child prodigy. When he was
ten years old he wrote a paper com-
paring three and five-toed elephants
and when he was 17 he photographed
stars and planets with his own tel-
escope, while lecturing to college up-
per classmen. ,

Compton received both his masters
and doctorate degrees at Princeton
University. He joined the faculty
here in 1923, and in 1930 was ap-
pointed Charles H. Swift distin-
guished Professor of Physics.

Opera, Ballet Program Cancelled

Cecil Smith, chairman of the Music Department, yesterday
announced the cancellation of the concerts originally scheduled
for May 24 and 25, which were to be the final ones of the

Composers Concert Series.

Holders of subscription tickets and
others who bought tickets in advance
will have their money refunded, by
turning in their tickets at the In-
formation Office, 5750 Ellis avenue.
These tickets are dated April 20, the
date announced when the series was
planned last fall.

In making the annuoncement Smith
explained the reasons for calling off
the performances at this time. The
ordinary difficulties in presenting a
program of this type which was to
include Darius Milhaud’s opera “Les
Malheurs d’Orphee” and the world
premiere of a ballet, with music com-
posed by Remi Gassman, were aggra-
vated by wartime delays in adequate
rehearsals and stage preparations.

“The programs could have been
given as scheduled, but it is* believed

Hayek...

(Continued from page one)
created by government money will last
only so long as the government ex-
penditures last. Moreover, any such
policy only aggravates the basic mal-
distribution causing the situation, and
makes the long-range problem harder
to solve.

Concerning Germany, the economist
said that “we must give them a poli-
tical structure which will give them
the incentive to improve their own
situation.” “Central control of Ger-
many,” he added, “must be under Al-
lied control indefinitely, with central
leaders chosen by the Allies; but we
should give them freedom to select
their own local government. This
political structure should be the main
instrument for re-educating Ger-
many.”

Hayek said that our relations with
Russia “should be as good as they
can without compromising our own
principles.” “Russia,” he said, “will co-
operate with other Allied nations, “ac-
cording to her own ideas.”

Hayek does not believe that other
nations of the world will enjoy a
higher standard of living after the
war. “Possibly America, but not oth-
er nations,” he cryptically remarked.

Hayek’s central thesis is that there
are two types of government planning
—illegitimate which leads to central
control of production by the govern-
ment and the stifling of healy ful
competition; and legitimate planning
which stimulates competition in pri-
vate industry with no governmental
strings attached. Hayek said that he
is “simply restating the relationship
between enterprise and government.”

Halke’s schedule here, arranged by
Joseph A. Brandt, director of the Uni-
versity Press, was jam packed. One of
the highlights was his heated radio
forum with Profs. Charles E. Merriam
and Maynard Krueger last Sunday.
He also spoke to numerous civic and
business groups in the city.

Marshal Field to Speak
Sunday on Round Table

Marshall Field, publisher, trustee
of the University, and author of the
recently published Freedom Is More
Than a Word, will be one of the parti-
cipants on the Round Table, at 12:30
p.m. Sunday. “A World Bill of
Rights” will be the subject of the
broadcast

Warren A. Seavey of the Law
School, Harvard University, and
Louise Gottschalk, Professor of Mod-
em History here, will be the other
speakers on the program.

The history of the Bill of Rights
in the United States and the advisa-
bility of a similar organ in a world
organization will be discussed.

the performance w'ould have been
artistically incompetent, and thus we
prefer to wait until next autumn,
when a much more perfect and less
hurried performance can be given,”
Smith said.

The dates for the concerts in the
fall have not yet been set, but will
be announced as soon as revised con-
tracts are signed with the principal
participants. In addition to the com-
posers, those who will be prominently
represented in the program include
Maude Phelps Hutchins, who has de-
signed the settings and costums for
the opera; Alexander Calder, who
has done the same for the ballet;
Ruth Page, choreographer of the bal-
let; and J. Ray Hunt, who wrote the
text to the narrative ballet.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Merriam Strikes Back at Hayek

Noted Revolutionist To Speak Here

Socialist To
Talk Monday

By ELEANOR GUTTMAN

Dr. Angelica Balabanoff, first secre-
tary of the Communist International,
authoress of a best-seller, “My Life
as a Rebel/* and outstanding Euro-
pean revolutionist, will discuss “Marx-
ism and the Present Events” at an
open meeting sponsored by the Social-
ist Club in Rosenwald 2 at 8 p.m.
Monday, April 30. Dr. Balabanoff is
in Chicago to speak at several May
Day celebrations of workers* and So-
cialist groups

From her birth to her present-day
exile in America, Dr. Balabanoff has
had a life replete with fascinating ex-
periences. During the first World
War, she was the Secretary of the
Zimmerwald movement, the interna-
tional grouping which declared the
war to be imperialist and urged frat-
ernization of the armies at the fronts
and international socialism to end the
war.

After the Russian Revolution of
1917, she returned to Russia and took
her place beside Lenin and Trotsky,
as the first Secretary of the Third In-
ternational and with a responsible
post in the revolutionary government.

Believing the establishment of So-
cialism in Russia to be impossible, she
left Russia for Italy where she was a
leader in the Italian Socialist Party.
Here she met and befriended Musso-
lini, then a poor and sick young man,
who later became editor of Avanti,
daily ‘ organ of the Italian Socialist
Party.

In America she wrote her well-
received “My Life as a Rebel.*’ She
spoke at Mandel Hall several years
ago, during which an overflow crowd
attended.

Two Public Lectures

On schedule for this week are two
public lectures in Room 34, Rosen-
wald Hall. Dr. J. Harlen Bretz will
speak on Wednesday at 4 p.m. on “The
Channeled Scablands of the Columbia
Plateau.”

At 8 p.m. on Thursday Dr. Everett
C. Olson will speak on “Kodachromes
of Paricutin.”

will be discussed. Concluding com-
ments will be delivered by James Wes-

Says That We
Need Planning

In direct opposition to Friedrich
A. Hayek, celebrated economist, who
is speaking on the Quadrangles this
week, Charles E. Merriam, professor
emeritus of political science, yester-
day asserted that “the values of free
government and free industrial soc-
iety cannot be preserved without
sound and effective planning.”

Hayek has charged that a “planned
economy” will lead to fascism and
totalitarianism.

“A drifting and planless society
is at the mercy of every reckless
group seeking privilege and power,”
Merriam said in his public lecture, the
fourth in a series on government and
the economic order in the United
States. “We can and do plan to sup-
port and stimulate private enter-
prise and industrial development at
points where governmental aid is re-
quired, as in agriculture, industry,
and labor.

“Our American type was begun
by Jefferson and Hamilton in their
great plans, one for free land develop-
ment and the other for the growth
of manufactures and industry,” Prof.
Merriam continued. “These goals have
been followed throughout the life
of the Republic, and have given Amer
ica the broadest and richest measure
of freedom ever enjoyed by any peo-
ple. In our day we seek and we shall
find freedom from the curse of war,
freedom from unemployment, freedom
from fear and want.”

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Page Four
Editorial

In recent weeks Jack Hill, the purveyor of
sports gossip for The Chicago Maroon, has been
waging one-man warfare against the adminis-
tration and all others who allegedly oppose an
athletic program at the University. However,
he has been virtually a voice in the wilderness,
for those who can scan the sporting pages form
the traditional “barbershop coterie”—the dyed-
in-the-wool faithful who are precisely those in
complete agreement with Mr. Hill, his premises
and his deductions.

In substance Mr. Hill is asserting that:

1.	The administration is hostile to sports.

2.	This hostility is, in a large measure, re-
sponsible for feeble Chicago showings on the
playing fields.

While we may agree with Mr. Hill’s premises
that a sports program is desirable, we believe
his position, and that of all who agree, that it is
the administration’s hostility which has led to
the decline of sportsdom here, is riddled with
fallacies and misconceptions. We believe that it
is high time that the vast welter of confusion and
misunderstanding which envelopes Chicago
sports should be dispelled once and for all.

For thirty-five years the University of Chi-
cago was one of the tians in the world of sport.
The grand old man of American collegiate foot-
ball, Amos Alonze Stagg, piloted the University
grid juggernauts to one of the most impressive
records ever massed. That Chicago sports was on
a par with the most hysterically-supported pro-
grams on any American campus is well sub-
stantiated by the fact that a recent survey has
shown that down through the years Chicago
tanks third among all the Big Ten teams in the
total number of championships won.

When, in 1939, Chicago suspended inter-
collegiate football, the President of the Univer-
sity made it crystal clear that the move was not
designed as a blow to the game itself, but to the
malpractices and hypocrisy which surrounded
it. Chicago was not objecting to football or any
sport as such, but it stood unalterably opposed
to the heavy subsidization and preselytizing, and
the fantastic super-structure of over-emphasis

The Challenge To Chicago Sportsdom

which had been given the sport. Too many Uni-
versities had become gridirons with classrooms
attached thereto.

The same position prevails today. If the
president and the Board of Trustees were
violently opposed to sports, we may rest assured
that action would be promptly forthcoming to
junk the program which exists today. The very
fact itself that a large well equipped, well staffed
plant is available is ample indication that the
University does not oppose sports and recreation.

If, as Mr. Hill charges, the battle cry has
been millions for research, but not one cent for
sports, then may we suggest that it is incumbent
upon those who believe sports essential—and we
should confess we are numbered among those to
a qualified extent—to demonstrate that a full and
well rounded program is an integral part of a
college curriculum, specifically of a liberal
education.

We do not believe that the sports program
here is as rudderless as Mr. Hill and his colleagues
would make it out to be. J. Kyle Anderson, act-
ing wartime director of athletics, and his staff
have drafted a program praiseworthy to any
University in wartime. Once manpower is
again available, it is certain that Chicago will
resume a full inter-collegiate schedule in every
sport—football excepted, of course. The Uni-
versity, even at this time, retains full member-
ship rights in the Big Ten conference and main-
tains inter-collegiate relations whenever the
material available for a squad, warrants it.
Even more important, however, will be the fur-
ther development and extension of an intra-
mural program of interest to everyone on cam-
pus.

The task before the sports proponents is, to
our way of thinking, incisive and clear cut:
They must convince the students of the Uni-
versity, NOT the administration, that a sports
program is desirable. Chicago’s position in the
future world of sports will prosper only to the
extent to which it is supported by the students
themselves.

This is the challenge to Chicago sportsdom.

Letters to Editor

“Oops!”

Milton Mayer, Maroon
Are Raked Over Coals

In Letters To The Editor

(Letters to the Editor is a weekly student opinion feature of The Chicago
Maroon. Students and faculty members of the University are invited to
submit letters of general campus interest, not to exceed 300 words. All letters
should be signed, though names will be withheld upon request, and addressed
to The Editor. They may be sent via faculty exchange.)

Mr. Mayer Is Taken to Task

To the Editor:

As one of our eminent professors has said, “The urge for
recognition manifests itself in strange ways.” Mr. Milton Mayer
exemplifies this statement to perfection by his numerous articles,
beginning with the Saturday Evening Post, to what might be
called the Post Mortem, or the Chicago Maroon.

In Mr. Mayer’s opening paragraph of the statement he issued, concerning
the death of F.D.R., he reflects the opinion of a great many Americans.
We all like to feel that even with the tragic loss of Mr. Roosevelt, his plans
will be carried through. Mayer is in agreement with this; however, after
attempting to win our confidence by the acknowledgement that the present
plans will remain unchanged, he, in the next paragraph, proceeds to under-
mine the faith in the peace plans already laid by our bereaved President.
Granted, it is very necessary for us to keep our eyes open in the making
of a permanent peace; yes, we must be firm and cautious, but not suspicious.
Mayer’s denouncement of the integrity of Great Britain and Russia will
only lead to a completely unsuccessful program. We must recognize the
fact that a lasting peace can only be attained with the cooperation of the
leading powers involved. “A peace of vengeance?” No, Mr. Mayer. Apeace
of justice. Isn’t that a better way of putting it?

Mayer goes on to speak of a normalcy that he believes President Truman
will inject into American thought and action. What is this normalcy that
he speaks of? It is simply a maintenance of the status quo. On this
assumption, Mayer infers that Truman would block any suggested progress.
This appears to be a bit of wishful thinking on his part, for the course that
Truman will take, other than supporting certain policies of Roosevelt, has not
yet been determined. To say that Harry Truman is “an honest liberal
Harding,” is to say that he is a political wheel horse and isolationist
To the contrary, upon Truman’s recipience to the presidency, he immediately
took decisive action by ordering that the San Francisco conference not be
postponed, by asking Molotov to the conference, and by stating that he would
back Roosevelt’s policies, proving himself to be anything but a wheel horse
or a person against international cooperation.

How about a little more faith, Mr. Mayer?

Sincerely,

Lolly Lurie

Public Courses In The
Humanities Attract
Wide Attention

Edward Kiloran Brown, professor of
English at the University, this week
delivered the fourth in a series of ten
lectures on “The Novel in England
from 1880 to the Present”.

The Public Courses in the Human-
ities, presented at the rate of six a
year for the past two years, were
suggested by the Cours Publiques
offered at French and German univer-
sities before the war. They are de-
signed to bridge the gap between
the highly specialized closed courses
in the divisions, and the popularized,
public lectures. Set up on this mid-
dle ground, the Courses offer fresh
material on a wide range of sub-
jects included in the Humanities Div-
ision. The material is currently being
investigated, and represents the per-
sonal work of the lecturer.

Organized as a book might be, it
frequently appears later in that form.
Designed to connect the detailed, tech-
nical courses of the division and the
interests of the general public, the
courses attract a wide range of people.

The subjects are either chosen by
the lecturer or suggested by the Pol-
icy Committee of the division, which
cooperates with Dean Richard McKe-
on, to the present series.

Professor Brown is a specialist in
modem fiction, and has published
several volumes on that subject. He
arriver here last July from Cor-
nell University, where he was chair-
man of the English Department. Ed-
ucated at the Universty of Toronto
and in Paris, Professor Brown was
recently (1942) a secretary to the
Prime Minister of Canada. Brown
will speak Monday night at 7:30 p.m.
in Social Science 122, on “The Theatre
Within: Henry James and Conrad.”

Aitken Lacks
Polish, Says
Music Scribe

BY SAMUEL GOLDEN

An enthusiastic, if small, audience
called back Webster Aitken for two
encores at a recital in Mandel* Hall
Tuesday of this week. The extra
numbers were Debussy’s Relects
dans 1’eau and Isle Joyeuse. The
audience was well rewarded for its
applause for in these works Mr. Ait-
ken’s artistry was most evident; the
flavor of the music was perfectly
caught and passed on to the listeners.

This cannot be equally said of the
rest of the program. The first selec-
tion, Haydn’s Andante con varia-
zioni, was interpreted with good
phrasing, but lacked variety and re-
sultant interest in the several varia-
tions. Chopin’s Sonata in B Minor
concluded the first half of the pro-
gram. Here Mr. Aitken’s inferred
intentions were better than their ac-
complishment. He differs from the
type of pianist who looks upon techni-
cal pasages as an opportunity to show
off; technique is held to be subservient
to musical comprehension. Judging
him by this standard, we may say he
did not succeed as well as he might
have. Contrasting sections were
played too much alike, and often in the
phrasing and, in the more difficult
pasages, the fluency and balance of
melodic line, were impure.

Inside Story of War
On Neuroses Being

Told Here

By Rose Encher

One of the most important as-
pects of the war is its effect on
men’s minds.

This is evidenced by the fact that
our armed forces “sift out” before
induction those who are subject to
neuroses. In this process, the armed
forces use various tests based on prin-
ciples of dynamic psychiatry, devel-
oped and tested at the University of
Chicago.

In a series of lectures on War
Psychiatry, Dr. Jules H. Masserman,
noted psychiatrist and psychologist, is
presenting a vivid portrayal of the
effects of the war on servicemen, civ-
ilians, and children, based on these
same principles, to which he has great-
ly contributed and which he has tested
in his original experiments at U. of C.
laboratories.

“War psychiatry is no different from
any other psychiatry,” said Dr. Mas-
serman in one of the lectures. “The
best way to determine how a soldier
will react to battle conditions is to
find out how he has reacted to all
other conditions in his life.”

Dr. Masserman has recently com-
pleted Principles of Dynamic Psychi-
atry which W. B. Saunders Co. is
publishing within several months. He
is the author of Behavior and Neurosis
(1943) in which he develops a theory
of the normal and abnormal and in
which he gives an account of some
of his original experiments.

Dr. Masserman’s work on his ex-
periments with “catatonic cats” (krazy
kats) was featured 2 years ago by
Time Magazine. Although these ex-
periments are particularly interesting
in that the cats react under artificially
created neuroses exactly as humans
do under neuroses, Dr. Masserman
says they form only a very small part
of his experiments which are made
to test the principles of dynamic psy-
chiatry. .

WAS GIFT OF
OIL MAGNATE

BY LOUISE HETZEL

To outsiders, familiar with
the tradition that lies behind it,
the gray stone building on the
far east side of campus is known
as International House. Here-
abouts we just call it “Int.
House’’, aware or not aware that
it has a parent in New York,
and a couple of sisters—one in
Berkeley, California, the other
in Paris, France.

Harry Edmonds of Columbia Col-
lege, known as “the father of the In-
ternational Houses,” interested John
D. Rockefeller in their establishment,
and they were subsequently built to
“unite the students of all nations in
a common life.” The Chicago “Int.
House” was preceded by the “Inter-
national Student Organization” which
met for suppers and discussions at
Ida Noyes Hall. Because of this grow-
ing interest, it was decided that the
site for the middle-western house
would be in Chicago. The location
was chosen at the site of the old Del
Prado Hotel, since this was conven-
iently near to the downtown section
and the University. After two years
of negotiation, the hotel was bought
for approximately $200,000. On Oct-
ober 5, 1932, “Int. House” was for-
mally opened, and the experiment
with international symbiosis, that is
now proving its worth, was auspici-
ously launched. A program had been
formulated and facilities were pro-
vided, among them numerous shops,
clubs, round tables, and dances.

When, in the Autumn of 1942, the
Army requisitioned the entire build-
ing, Charles Rovetta, the newly ap-
pointed manager, had to reorganize
completely. At its maximum, “Int.
House” had served 505 students; now
the Army planned to house 1220 ca-
dets. The Army stepped in, and the
“Int. House” residents were moved
to new apartments that had been
found for them. With the aid of the
Army program “Int. House” has been
restored to the students.

Even though the Army used the
house as its barracks for two years,
the activities program was retained
and former occupants could still
gather for discussions and meetings.

With the preparations of these
fifteen years, “Int. House” is well
equipped to receive the many foreign
students, expected after the war, to
take courses that will aid them in
the rehabilitation of their countries.
“Int. House” is a powerful agent in
leading the campus to a fuller respect
for the peoples with whom we will
build the peace, Rovetta has pointed
out.

Last week, as we were walking past Rockefeller, we saw a well-uphol-

the low wall which runs next to the sidewalk. As she saw us, she stepped
down sheepishly and in embarrassed tones remarked, “You know, I just
couldn’t resist it!”

Early Morning Sights

Wednesday morning Green Hall had a fire drill at seven—passers-by
were amazed at the number of residents who wear nightcaps. One a.m. in
the wee sma’ hours, a pair of young females were treading fearfully down
University home from a bridge game in the dorms after a picnic. As they
passed Eckhart a car slowed down, the door opened, and a masculine foot
appeared. Quick on the draw, the girls drew out the butcher knives they had
used at the picnic and flourished them at the car. The car drove away and
friend females proceeded peacefully home.

Social Life

Beecher and Burton-Judson have entered into a reciprocal agreement—
Wednesday twenty girls went over to BJ for dinner and twenty fellows gorged
at Beecher. Later in the evening, everyone came over to Beecher. From what
we hear, Blake’s picnic at the promontory last Sunday was a howling success
with lots of men from Hitchcock. Wyverns enjoyed themselves at their par-
ty Sunday at the Fiji house. The Burton 200 Entry must be anti-social—we
hear there was a great feud as to whether they should pay the social fee.
Personal

Ruth Weiss was ironing Rod MacLeish’s shirts over at Gates and it
seems several wags began to place tender notes in the pockets (sample:
“Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make like thee.”) Char-
lie Einstein is down in Norfolk all ready to go to Niagra Falls for Leo Dar-
darian’s induction. Ken Biehl was visiting the campus this week. Planning
to leave for cadet-midshipman school are John Robinson, Jack McCarthy, and
John Spencer; Walt Hagens goes in Radar training. Marge Schollenberger
Shaw is expecting a little one.

Around the Campus

Sunday we impressed several prospective freshmen on a tour of the
campus—they still believe that whatever we don’t understand on campus we
call a tradition (that’s true, at least, in the case of the unwashed windows at
the Commons). There is a forgetful woman on campus: on the bookstore
mailbox there is a little note to the postman that she mailed a letter to Lieu-
tenant So-and-so and neglected to put a stamp on it; attached is an air mail
stamp which the postman is supposed to lick and put on the letter (it’s a ‘very
important epistle).

The Red Bogey

One of the daily papers had a screaming headline the other day that
“Chaos Rules in Berlin.” Our favorite earnest-minded Communist took one
look at the headline, turned away in disgust, and said, “I simply don’t see
why there’s so much prejudice about the Russians; they’re just as orderly
as we.”

In meeting Illinois Tech, Chicago
faces an opponent that opened the
season for the Maroons in a bad way.
Tech slapped out 15 hits and won,
18 to 2, to start out Anderson’s men
in a definitely bad way.

The Concordia trip brings Chicago
up against a slightly weaker squad

Full Schedule Opens
Girls’ Season Here

Opening the 1945 girls’ baseball
season was the Green Hall—Inde-
pendent game of April 9th with The
Independents victorious 14-4.

Following that game, the Quads
defeated Green 14-0, Kelly took Bea-
cher 22-12, and Esoteric bowed to
Foster 15-3. Last week Green again
had bad luck when Kelly triumphed
8-4. Independent defaulted to the
Commuters of the 11th Grade.

Tau Sigma disappointed a lot of
expectant players by withdrawing
from the schedule and two more
defaults took place: the 12th Grade
to the Independents and Beecher Hall
to Quadrangler. x

Bartlett Houses CAAU Men's
Open Gymnast Meet Saturday

Tomorrow Bartlett Gymnasium will be the home of a CAAU
gymnastic meet for the second time in as many Saturdays, when
the combined talent of the midwest will meet in the Central open

meet.

Last Saturday’s meet, restricted to
high school teams, was won by Senn
high, with Lindblom placing second
and the Chicago college squad placing
third. Lindblom’s Rotzheim, all-city
champ, did a repeat performance in
leading the Lindblom squad and win-
ning the individual honors.

Led by Gordon Sherman and
Louis Levit, the University squad
is rated as one of the best team
entries in tomorrow’s meet and a
well rounded team, thoroughly
coached by former national cham-
pion Bud Beyer, should fill out the
Maroon entry in a winning way.

Sherman, last year’s men’s novice
champion, and Levit, the 1944 senior
champion and holder of the side horse
title, will lead a six man squad round-
ed out by place winner in 1944, Ernest
Hillard and last Saturday’s perform-
ers such as Gammers, Miners, Boyl-
ston and Sampsell. Competition starts
at 2:00, Saturday afternoon and an ad-
mission charge of 25 cents will be
charged to defray meet expenses.

We’ve committed a grave in-
justice to the tennis team. Here-
tofor, this column hasn’t thought
too highly of Coach Norgren’s
racketmen as we were never par-
ticularly strong on the game of
tennis itself, but since the Ma-
roon court squad seems to be the
only team winning on campus,
we have taken a complete turn
about and we are now forced to
eat crow.

iTennis Team
Seeks Big 10
Championship

With an easy, 6-1 victory over
a green Illinois Tech tennis
squad, Coach Nels Norgren’s
racketmen made it three straight
in their quest for a perfect dual
season. Chicago opened its 1945
season by whitewashing North
Central 6-0 and followed up with
a win over Northwestern, 8 to 1.

Led by Phil Glotzer and Harry Tully,
seeded in that order, the Maroons go
to Na perMlle tomorrow for a meet
with North Central College. The Uni-
versity will go as heavy favorite due
to its 6-0 win at the beginning of the
season. z

Glotzer and Tully, plus Norm Green-
burg and Tom Grayston are unde-
feated in three matches while Dick
Shapiro and Alden Mathews have both
suffered one defeat in the same num-
ber of matches.

In meeting Illinois Tech, Chicago
had a definite advantage as the Tech
boys lack facilities to practice indoors
while the University Fieldhouse af-
fords ample accomodations to the
Maroons. Because of weather condi-
tions during the matches on Wednes-
day, it was necessary for about half
of the games to be finished indoors.

Results of the Northwestern meet:

By whipping Northwe s tern
(Praise the Lord!) so soundly and
previous to that swamping North
Central’s farm boys, the tennis
players have earned our undying
gratitude. The sports page can at
last feature some winning stories.

And now for the baseball team.
Last week’s Maroon was without
Time In, we were and still are in
mourning for Coach Anderson’s
young hopefuls. In three games, Chi-
cago has had 55 runs scored against
it while in the same time Chicago
has scored 8 runs. However, looking
at the bright side of the ledger, and
we have been forced to hunt for a
bright side, last year’s squad had
157 runs against it in 15 games so
maybe we shouldn’t be too down
hearted. Using a slide rule we still
haven’t figured it out but things look
bleak.

Aitken...

(Continued from page 5)

The second half of the program
opened with the playing of Copland’s
Piano Variations composed in 1930.
This was quite unintelligible; whether
or not Mr. Aitken felt that Copland’s
music was primitive or barbaric I
don’t know, but he certainly played it
so. The variations were played
noisily and disconnectedly. I believe
there is music in the score, and that
the fault lay more in Mr. Aitken’s
failure to grasp the meaning of the
music. Lt tombeau de Couperin by
Ravel was the closing number on the
announced program. This very ap-
pealing set of five movements was
quite well played, but again, in Mr.
Aitken’s performance there was a
too prominent sameness in the inter-
pretation. Justice is not done to Ra-
vel by playing all his works in a
dreamy reminiscent fashion. Grant-
ing his impressionistic style, it is
important to realize that Ravel is a
composer of many moods, and these
should be brought out in the perform-
ance. Two movements were, however,
played with fine, authentic feeling,
the Forlane and final Tocatta.

Masserman...

(Continued from page 5)

Dr. Masserman has been here since
1935. He is Assistant Professor of
Psychiatry and Research Associate in
the Otho D. S. Sprague Memorial In-
stitute.

Along with his many duties and
contributions to psychiatric research,
Dr. Masserman finds time to play the
violin and viol and is also a sailboat
enthusiast. His wife is Christine
McGuire of the Economics Depart-
ment.

was made that “there were no services” here on this campus to commemorate
the life of Franklin Roosevelt. I wish merely to call to your attention
the fact that a service was held in Graham Taylor Hall of the Chicago
Theological Seminary at 9:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 12, just four hours
after we received the announcement of the President’s death. Those who
called the University operators to inquire about services after seven o’clock
were told of this service. Graham Taylor Hall was filled with students,
faculty and other people.

Though this service took in but a small portion of the University
family, it needs to be said there were here on our own campus sorrowed
hearts lifted up in prayers of thanks for the life of a great leader.

Sincerely yours,
Fred Berthold

Chapter 3 of a Slam-Bang Feud

To the Editor:

Disappointed Dan has been silenced. We are now, however, faced with
another slanderous ASTP-er, proud of his gastric incapacity, namely,
Nauseated Ned.

He accuses us of “lack of pride and dignity.. .disreputable appearance”...
being “eyesores”.. .wearing‘"unsightly apparel.. .looking like a wet dog”...
lacking “good taste and good sense.”

Now one is not ordinarly obliged to .overlook such igneous epithets.
But all did not occur without raised left eyebrows of such prudent gentlemen
stand for a “little more glamour” and try a proper diet.

In the days of yore, the popular belle wore hoops. This style through
time evolved into a bustle and the hour-glass silhouette. Then the pinched
waistline widened to encompass the hips and finally found its righteous place.
But all did not occur without raised left eyebrows of such prudent gentlemen
as had little else to occupy their time but to concentrate on the change.

I am sure that least of all poor Ned would advocate going back to the
hoop days. Such garb was uncomfortable and impedimental. There are
certain vestiges of discomfort remaining in the costume of today. History
indicates that through a process of selective evolution these annoying
vestiges are being eliminated.

The dungy is a trusty pioneer; and you had just as well sneer at
Columbus, Daniel Boone and the 49’ers.

Picture poor squeamish Ned—if we had allowed ourselves to be shackled
to tradition and conformity-dashing about in tights and perfumed rufflets.

If I were he, I would lie down quietly with an emesis basin near at hand,
wait till it’s all over and beg humbly the pardon of the U. of C. co-eds.

THE CHICAGO MAROON ---------------------------------

Friday, April 27, 1945

idlSKiih Ilie HI HIM

At the Cloisters, outside Ida Noyes Hall, you meet
Louise Harvey . . . this week's glamor girl, this year's
president of Mortar Board, a gal of many
interests and many friends. Academically,

Louise concentrates on psychology . . . away from studies
you're likely to find her busy with such
sports as flying, ice-boating, sailing (depending
on the weather and her mood). On campus, you'11 see her
looking like this ... a pretty girl who knows the kind
of clothes that will make her look even prettier.

Where does she find them? Answer (though we bet you
guessed it) . . . at Marshall Field & Company!

For instance, the icing-white dress she has on in the
pictured here, is from their Sports Room •.. a B. H. Wragge
design (which means it’s comfortable, it’s classic, it’s
wearable in the city, in the country, on campus!)

You’re sold? And want to know the statistics?

Fabric . . . white rayon sharkskin. Belt . . . "jeweled”
black ribbon. Sizes ... 10 to 18. Price . . . $29.95.

Waiting for you to try it on tomorrow in the

Sports Room—Sixth Floor, Middle, IF abash

Meet the Beet People. Every week, on this page,
the Chicago Maroon will introduce you to another^
University of Chicago glamor girl • • • a winning campus
personality. And every week you’ll see her in an
attractive costume she’s chosen at Marshall Field & Company.
