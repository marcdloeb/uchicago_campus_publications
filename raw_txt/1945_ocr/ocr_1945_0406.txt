Queen to Reign at Dance;

Plan to Enforce Curfew

Sponsored by the Student So-
cial Committee and the War
Stamp Committee, the War
Stamp Ball will be held tomor-
row evening in the International
House Theater from 8:00 to
12:00 P.M. Although the dance
is formal, many couples are ex-
pected to attend informally. The
price of bids, $1.75, includes the
purchase of two 25c war stamps.

With the intent of boosting the sale
of war bonds and stamps, votes for
the Beauty Queen to be elected at the
Ball may be cast with each purchase
of a 10c war stamp. Nominations for
the Queen are still being made
through ballot boxes located in the
Mandel corridor, Ida Noyes, the Bur-
sar’s office and Harper M-15. Any
girl on the Quadrangles is eligible.

A Blind Date Bureau in Man-
del corridor under the chair-
manship of Mary Rhine, has been
operating for three weeks in pre-
paration for the Ball. It has had
such a landslide business that a
second date Bureau has been
opened in Ida Noyes Hall for
Navy men.

Chairman of the dance is Muriel
Newman, head of the War Stamp
Committee. Lya Dym has planned the
decorations and Pat Cowan is in
charge of refreshments.

Dancing, which will continue only
until 12:00, because of the midnight
curfew, will be to the music of Parker
Melling’s eight piece orchestra.

Another series of Faculty-student
Teas is expected to be inaugurated
this Quarter to encourage the sale of
war bonds and stamps. In addition
to aiding the war effort the series held
last quarter served to acquaint stu-
dents with favorite faculty members.

Abe Krash New Maroon Editor;
Gottesman Replaces Schrieber

Krash held an eight-vote margin, but
lacked five votes of the two-thirds

Three magazines with a nationwide circulation in excess of
twelve million readers have featured the University or its affiliates

acrobatic classes.

The Reader’s Digest in its April
edition now on the newsstands fea-
tured Fredrich A. Hayek’s “The Road
to Serfdom” published by the Univer-
sity Press. The book, now in its sev-
enth printing, has been hailed as “one
of the most important books of our
generation.”

Life Magazine is the third member
of the trio to publicize the University.
The Luce publication in its edition of
March 12 printed an eleven page arti-
cle by Guiseppe Antonio Borgese^

chapel and an address on April 15 by
Walter Judd, congressman and for-
mer medical missionary.

Purpose of the conference, ac-
cording to Co-Chairman Janet
Davidson and Malcolm McAfee,
is to provide an opportunity for
discussion of basic social ques-
tions and the underlying reasons
motivations behind social and po-
litical action.

Gilkey will launch the conference
in his Sunday morning sermon, dis-
cussing “When You Need Strength
to Carry On.” Sunday evening the
group discussion will start with Chan-
ning Club, Wranglers, Phoenix House,
and Chapel Union airing the question
and listening to possible solutions. In
addition to the separate group meet-
ings, a round table to be held Thurs-
day at 8 P.M. and a summary discus-

education. Beyer initiated the classes
last fall in seeking cheer leaders and
combined his boy gymnasts with his
prospective yell leaders in training.
Since then the plan has evolved into

Advantages of the plan, Beyer told
Look, include good health, activity to
relieve tension, coordination, and co-
operation.

Photos of the acrobats moving
through actual practice sessions are
shown.

The Digest has condensed Hayek’s

addition a half page of comments
from noted book critics.

Forum Hears Anthony
Argue for Esperanto

Student Forum presented Dr. A. P.
Anthony, President of The Interna-
tional Language Foundation, who
spoke on Esperanto, “language of
the future,” Tuesday night.

Esperanto, Dr. Anthony urged,
should be adopted as an auxiliary
language to the national one in or-
der to facilitate intercommunication
among all peoples of all the countries
in the world. Adoption of any exist-
ing national language would be re-
sented and obstructed by all the other
nations, but Esperanto, a scientifically
constructed language, could unhesi-
tatingly be accepted.

The scientific construction of the
language obviates the possibility of
idioms and other irregularities which
make foreign languages so difficult
to master.

position.

We believe, however, that a candid statement
of The Maroon's position as a newspaper on the
campus is due to all concerned.

We believe that we have a definite responsi-
bility to the student body of the University. It
is not only to tell the news in the most compre-
hensive and objective manner possible, but it is
to further serve as a guide to opinion, as a rep-
resentative “sounding board/’ if you Will, of the
most astute reading clientele of any college pub-
lication today. We shall never be satisfied with
merely printing the news.

The Maroon is one of the few newspapers in
the land which is not an adjunct of a journalism
school. It is further one of a handful of publi-
cations completely free of faculty interference
and administration censorship: We are proud of
that record and we shall attempt to maintain it.

To the Editor:

Several weeks ago you pub-
lished a letter from some irate
student suggesting that Harper
Library’s signs should read, “We
Steal.” I’d like to extend this con-
demnation to Wieboldt and the
Commons, perhaps having the
sign read “Abandon books, all
ago, I bought an English book,
ye that enter here.” Several days
left it outside the Commons at
eleven thirty, and at twelve it
was gone.

I realize that Wieboldt and Com-
mons warn you and assume no re-
sponsibility, but where can a student
leave his books during the lurich
hour? Off campus students have loc-
kers, which leaves the rest of us prey
to the itching fingers of some minor-
league Mephistopheles.

Isn’t is possible for some check
system to be installed at the Com-
mons where books would be watched?
At only a small expense to the school,
a great many students would save
enough money to pay the new tui-
tion boost. While all book-lovers
should be encouraged, let them build
their library on a firmer founda-

All post-war plans based on a
greatly expanded economy call for
a much larger number of people than
are now available or which can be
produced by American schools with
their present facilities. The fact that
too many capable people have been
deprived of higher education has con-
tributed to our present labor shor-
tage. The G.I. Bill of Rights provides
an excellent basis for democratic edu-
cation, i.e., regardless of race, sex or
economic status. The idea of an “aris-
tocracy of education” belongs to the
Middle Ages.

There is a great need for a free-
four-year college in Chicago. In con-
nection with this there is legislation
pending in Springfield which if passed
would allow the city to operate such
an institution. In Congress, too, bills
are pending which concern aid to col-
leges. Information on this matter
should be presented to the people to
enable them to express themselves
constructively and to get the bills
passed in the best possible form.
We are launching such a campaign
in the sincere hope that it will aid
in achieveing this.

|*This Is Our Credo..."
g Journalists the world over live in an ivory
tower of tradition which dictates that, in his first
^edition, each new editor of a newspaper shall
; raise his green eye-shade and inform his public,
; with the most glittering generalities and in the
V most grandiose manner possible, of the platform
J and policy he intends to follow. The public to
. whom it is directed, however, has been pampered
on a “news in capsule form” diet and hence has
come to expect a brisk, alliterative, jingle-like
motto which can be flung into any fray in which
the newspaper may engage.

We of the University of Chicago have long
lived in an ivory tower across the street from
the newshounds, and it is from this ivory tower
that we have insisted that there is a limit to tra-
dition and that there is far more to a policy than
cryptic punch-words. We of The Maroon believe
that no policy is ever enunciated by one who
marches up and down the highways and byways
and spouts from the rooftop to all who pass that
he is either liberal or conservative, pleasantly
pink or Flaming Fascist. Concrete policies are
only those seen in a consistent, concerted line of
action as presented over a long period of time in
. an honest and forthright manner.

And it is thus that we believe that one is ask-
ing the impossible in seeking a lengthy and in-

NEWS ITEM: University of Chicago women are “socially imma-

stationed on the campus said last week in a letter to the editor, published
by the Geisha Gazette, ASTP journal on the campus.

The writer, styling himself “Disappointed Dan” said that his com-
pany, composed of many former college men, had been stationed on the
campus for six weeks and had “an ample opportunity to become acquaint-
ed with that species of fauna known as the U. of C. co-ed.” “It’s been a
rather disappointing and deluding experience,” he added.

“We have met co-eds from various sections of the country. Then
came Chicago! And our first experience with blue jeans rolled up to the
hips and sweaters drooping down to meet them.”

“Aside from lack of propriety and sense of taste with regard to
clothing and manners, they seem to possess few of the graceful and
charming qualities usually acquainted with women of culture.”

We believe furthermore that we must be dras-
tically independent, free from bias and petty
prejudices, a member of no party but sympathet-
ic to all. We shall never be dominated by any
i pressure group or petty clique. Our columns
will always be open to comment and opinion from
every faction, from every individual on the cam-
pus. x

We shall be constructive critics in that we
shall praise the good, denounce that which we re-
gard as unjust and contrary to the well being
of the University as a whole.

We shall promote every worthwhile student
activity to the greatest possible extent, from
the religious groups to athletics, from political
clubs to the dormitory program. We believe fur-
thermore that the gap between The College and
The Divisions must be bridged and that the in-
ternal discord within The College itself must be
re-solved. To this end, the columns of The Ma-
roon shall henceforth be open to The College and
to The Divisions alike.

And yet not everything of vital concern to
the University occurs within the narrow confines
of the Quadrangles. Events of the greatest sig-
nificance to higher education and to University
students as participants in this education are
constantly taking place. Too often, in our narrow
and petty fashion we bury our heads in the sand
and sidestep these events. We of The Maroon
have no sympathy with such ostriches. We shall
literally lift the latch in our news and editorial
columns alike to such material and we shall al-
ways welcome the comments of others on the
Quadrangles, faculty and students alike, on such
matters which are of timely import.

There is no room on this campus for flabby
or fragile thinking. On these Quadrangles are
collected some of the most brilliant and penetrat-
ing minds in the world of learning, scholars and
students alike. They have a right to expect hon-
esty and a firm and a positive stand on vital is-
sues. As such we shall never hesitate to criticize
even those who are shielded by the veil of
authority.

In our turn we do not expect to be spared crit-
icism. But we believe that criticism levelled
against us should be at all times honest, openly
stated, justifiable, and constructive. We shall
always welcome such an analysis.

This then is our credo.

"Perfection,"
Says Reviewer
Of Schnabel

By Samuel Golden

It is not an easy task to sit
down and type out a review of a
Schnabel concert. If I’m honest
with myself, I will think, “What
is there to say? The man is per-
fection himself, anything I say
can only detract from what was
expressed in the music.” But
what are the evidences of this
man’s greatness, which everyone
in Mandel Hall surely felt?

They can best be described as they
appeared in Beethoven’s Thirty-three
Variations on a Waltz by A* Diabelli,
Opus 120, which comprised the con-
cluding half of the concert. These
variations cover a wide range of dif-
ferent moods; together they are more
in the nature of a well-unified con-
cert than a single piece. It is as
though Beethoven had, using the Dia-
belli waltz as the barest formal out-
line, allowed his mind to dwell upon
many different past impressions, and
set these down into music. Sometimes
one variation grows out of another,
at other times successive movements
are of a completely contrasting cha-
racter. Isn’t this n)uch like the way
our imaginations work, in bringing
together impressions of greater or
lesser logical association? It would
be of little purpose to point out any
movements as especially good; though
some are naturally more appealing
than others, they are all of a high
standard of emotional “realness”. One
has the feeling that every one is
in its proper place, and that none
could be altered without destroying
a part o‘f the effect.

The art of Beethoven is evident;
the art of Schnabel is in reliving
with perfect authenticity this emo-
tional experience of the composer.
Mr. Schnabel plays effortlessly, star-
ing into space dreamily, as though
he were listening with uninhibited
appreciation while his fingers, ap-
parently unconnected to the erst of
his body, play the music of Beetho-
ven as it was meant to be played.

It would almost be an insult to
the man’s artistic sense to make a
purely technical analysis of his per-
formance. Within every phrase there
are definite tempo changes, unnoticed
because they definitely belong in the
music; a near infinity of subtleties
of dynamics and even tone color are
given out in Mr. Schnabel’s inter-
pretation. How true it must appear
that the whole of the music of a
work cannot be represented an the
printed page!

Famed Political Scientist To
Examine Gov't & Economics

By JOHN K. ROBINSON

Dr. Charles E. Merriam, regarded as America’s foremost political
scientist, will begin a series of six lectures for the Walgreen Foundation
next Thursday and will analyse government and the economic order in
the United States in one of the most significant lecture series ever to

der in the United States.” The under-
graduate and graduate students of
the University are expected to be the
principle beneficiaries of the fund.
The annual program is formulated by
the executive secretary of the foun-
dation and is then submitted to the
President and one of the vice-presi-
dents of the University for their
sanction.

During the coming six weeks, on
Thursday afternoons at 3 p.m. in
Room 122,- Social Science research
building, the spring quarter series
will be presented as part of the course
“American Political Theories” which
is offered on Tuesdays and Thurs-
days from 2 to 4 p.m.

In his lectures Merriam will combine
history, economics, and government in
a “theory practice” revue of the ori-
gins of the present order of govern-
ment in the United States. The se-
cond and third in his talks are planned
to set forth, by discussion, the am-
biguity, if there is such, in the terms
“equality, freedom”, and “security”.
Dr. Merriam intends also to show
that there are certain important facts
in history we must first know before
the “political and power” struggles
and questions of our day and age
can be solved.

Im the fourth and fifth lectures
of the group, the clear understand-
ing of the words “socialism” and
“individualism”; our differences and
limitations; the proposed plans; and
the prospects that we can look for-
ward to are to be treated as a build-
up for the findings and conclusion
of the lecture.

In the first World War he was
chairman of the Aviation Examining
Board and later directed Allied pro-
paganda in Italy. He is the author
of a score of books on political theo-
ry, political education, and related
fields. Among his works is a volume
entitled “What Is Democracy”,
which is a Foundation Study Publica-
tion of a former series of lectures.

be presented on the Quadrangles.

Merriam, Morton D. Hull Distin-
guished Service Professor Emeritus
of Political Science, proposes to “shed
more light on the line between econo-
mics and government thru semantics,
psychology, and the differences of
public and private government.

His lectures are
another in the
Walgreen founda-
tion series, es-
tablished in 1936 as
a gift of the fam-
ily of the late
Charles R. Wal-
green, drug store
tycoon, and the
lectures and func-
tions of the foun-

Merriam

dation are all directed toward the
furtherance of the study and inter-
pretation of American institutions.
Thus the title of Merriam’s lectures:

Servin' It Hot

First surprise of the week comes
with viewing Warner Brothers short,
Jamming the Blues at the State-Lake
Theater. At last we have Hollywood
showing some semblance of maturity
and appreciation in its approach to
jazz. Under the direction of Gjon
Mili and Norman Granz the photog-
raphy is startling, the music authen-
tic, the whole presentation gratifying-
ly serious.

The picture fades in on a curl of
cigarette smoke crossing a mysterious
black circle, which evolves into the
top of Lester Young’s hat. Eight men
sit on a barren, shadowed stage, ex-
changing choruses of the blues.

A striking female strolls across the
foreground, to reappear presently,
blurring in through a shutter effect,
to sing Sunny Side of the Street. She
sings, as all the musicians play, in a
relaxed and expressive manner. With
the change of mood the background is
lightened and two silhouetted figures
are introduced who work through a
few rather abstract “jitterbug” steps.
Here we have the only evidence of the
danger imminent in such an ambitious
production—a lack of essential unity
between photography and music.
There was some slight slip between
the photographing of the scene and
the recording of the sound track; the
dancers are perfoming from another
sphere with complete disregard for
what the musicians are playing.

The last number is a fast jump
tune. Joe Jones replaces Big Sid Cat-
let on drums, and all ride like mad. At
the very end there seems to be the
danger of reverting from the inti-
mate jam style to big band riffs, but
the danger is never realized.

Orchids to Hollywood for the cour-
age and integrity it displays in Jam'
ming the Blues. There’s no compro-
mising on jazz—not even on the point
of presenting a mixed band (although
the photography is so that this fact
is almost unnoticed.) There was a
thrill in noting the reaction of the
theater audience, who by their ap-
plause at the finish and their excla-
mations throughout the picture dem-
onstrated their appreciation of the
unique, intelligent presentation of an
unappreciated American art.

Paine’s Works

The Selected Work of Tom Paine
by Howard .Fast.

Howard Fast has chosen an excel-
lent and timely topic for his new book
and presents it well. Much of the
writing of Tom Paine will bear re-
reading today—as much for idea con-
tent as historiacl value. The sincerity
of a writer who believed in freedom
and the Rights of Man and the sim-
plicity with which he presented the
most intricate political ideas to “the
man on the street” of Revolutionary
America makes his work as important
and as readable today as it was 160
years ago.

Mr. Fast ties the “Works” together
with short biographical sketches,
which show us the man Tom Paine
and his motives and give a better
understanding of the original material.

The Evils of Tobacco

Even if one doesn’t believe in the evil effects of nicotine, one
still has to consider the nuisance value of the comments of others
on the use of the weed. One of our friends, a young thing of
twenty who ordinarily gets half her fare back on street cars, has
taken to smoking a very ladylike pipe. She reports that every
other person she meets has attempted to advise her as to what
type of tobacco to use. Small boys have been following her down
the street and chiding her in dulcet tones that smoking isn’t good
for her. But the crowning blow was the morning a queenly
woman passed her on the street, looked her up and down, and
shuddered, “Now I’ve seen everything Yf

History Repeats Itself	।

Several years ago at a tenth grade dance, a stink bomb was tossed at
the dancers and caused no end of trouble. It is reported that Harold A. An-
derson (now Marshal of the University) complained to the students that a
“stench missile” had been thrown. And now we hear that some happy soul(s)
at Burton-Judson tossed one of the afore-mentioned articles down in the
court. One of our better known deans went over and with a blush on his
trembling chin remarked* “I heah that some one has been throwing—er-—
stench missiles.” In time this euphemism should become a University tra-
dition.

Easter Sunday, April Fool’s Day Too

Some well-meaning soul on Easter wandered happily into Gates Hall and
blithely inquired whether it was Bond Chapel. This seems to be the first time
that saintliness has been imputed to the denizens of Gates. The University
of Washington came out with something that the Maroon might have done—
a beautifully integrated April Fool’s Day paper. We note that 13,000 men
will be sent to the Washington campus to alleviate the shortage—and in order
to take care of the 13,000 men a marriage course will be repeated (probably
on the principle that if at first you don’t succeed, etc.).

Bombs Away!

The University of Chicago seems to be inaugurating an official course
for would-be bombardiers. For several weeks we have been chronicling the
assortment of articles which have been dropped from (usually) the top floor
of Beecher. The latest: our esteemed (apparently—he’s been singled out
often) Counsellor to Student Publications was strolling over to the Maroon
elections last Friday and narrowly escaped with his life when a publicity-
hungry female in Beecher tossed down a roll of john paper. This seems to
be adding insult to injury after last week’s paper bag filled with water.
Personal

Patty Meyers definitely is not engaged—so don’t believe all the rumors
you read in this column... Betty Early got herself hitched to Lieutenant Sid
Cryst, George Schroeder has given his pin to an off-campus queen ... We hear
from China that Lt. Barnet Rosset had a close shave when he arrived to take
up his duties at a Chinese Combat Command field headquarters—it seems he
nearly drove into the Japanese lines until some Chinese soldiers halted him
at abroad barrier . . . Contributions of green eye-shades are being solicited for

More Burton-Judson

Maureen Daly has been taken to heart by some of the literates at Burton-
Judson. They have christened the heads “creeps” and assistant heads
“droops” (as well as sundry other names unprintable). Someone has been
spreading a false rumor to the effect that there are no elevators in the 200
Entry because the inmates always use their wings whenever practicable.
Sweet Talk of Springtime

Down at Morton’s the other night a handholding couple were having an
earnest conversation. As the love light gleamed in their eyes, he was heard
to say with great emotion, “You know, you’re talking in syllogisms.” Last
year many eyebrows were raised when people saw a sign at the Commons
urging all students interested in employment to “See Miss Giltnor on the
Ground Floor.” This year it was changed slightly to a mere “See Miss Giltnor”
_and now an interested person has written after those words “On the Floor?”

"Thunder Rock,” English Film,
Asks Hope For World’s Future

“Thunder Rock”, the new film at the Playhouse, could be classed as prop-
aganda, not because it converts to free-love or nationalism, but because it
asks for faith in the future of the world. But then again, classifying movies
as comedy, western, or propaganda material assumes the use of certain
cinematic clichees which exclude originality, to a great extent. “Thunder
Rock” is an original attempt, and it deserves better treatment.

The plot, adapted from a not too
successful play, concerns a young
journalist who, after failing to make
England aware of the Fascist men-
ace, retires to a light house, escap-
ing from a world he cannot help.
To amuse himself, he constructs an
imaginary society of six persons he
knows were drowned in 1849. They
too, it seems, were all running away
from problems they could not face.

As these images return to the dead,
after telling their stories, the man
gains faith and the courage to fight
again. This sounds remarkably trite,
but plot synopses have a way of
doing that.

Since this is an English film, the
actors are unfamiliar, except for Mi-
chael Redgrave, who does a good job
as the light-house keeper. The others,
phantoms included, were excellent

‘Take Me Out to the Ball Game... ’

Time In

Tomorrow, Chicago starts the
long road back to universal par-
ticipation in athletics the right
way. It’s true that tomorrow’s
game is with a fairly small
school, Illinois Tech, but the
team has several games with big
name schools also and if this
year’s baseball squad can turn in
any kind of record at all, Presi-
dent Hutchins and friends may
sit up and take notice.

We know that tomorrow is al-
so Play Day for the Girls’ clubs
on campus and we also know
that they are playing host to
Northwestern, Mundelein College
and several other schools but
we’d like to ask all the girls from
all the clubs to come out and see
the game. Bring your visitors
along. About fifty per cent of
the available man power on cam-
pus will be represented on the
diamond.

When we were talking to Coach Kyle
Anderson, he told us that all he asks
is for an even break in the game and
some good baseball weather. Kyle is
very happy at the depth this year’s
squad has shown. Competition is keen
for nearly every spot on the team and
for a change Kyle doesn’t have to
worry about one man dropping from
the team -

The college blossoms out in
all its athletic glory this next
week. Tennis, baseball and track
all carry heavy schedules with
meets as often as three times
a week. We’re going to need sev-
eral new members of the staff
for these various activities so if
you happen to be in the first two
years of the college and know
anything about writing drop
around to Lexington and see us.
There isn’t much work and the
position of sport’s editor may be
open in the near future.

AAU MEET ENDS
INDOORTRACK

Closing a fair indoor track season,
the University of Chicago placed fifth
in the annual Central A.A.U, field
and track meet at the University
Fieldhouse last Saturday. A Great
Lakes Naval training station squad
walked off with the meet, winning
8 first places and scoring 139 points.
Led by three double winners, Cara,
Eisenhart and Klemmer, the Lakes
team was never seriously threatened
by the second place Illinois Tech
squad.

The Maroons placed three men.
Rust was third in the 600 yard run,
Russell, team captain, placed fourth
in the 70 yard high hurdles and Bok-
man took a fourth in the 1000 yard
run. It was Bokman’s first time in
the 1000 as was it the first time for
Rust in the 600.

With the close of the regular in-
door track season, Coach Merriam
will now turn his attention to the
outdoor season. Merriam has been
working with several men on the
Stagg Field track but needs a much
larger squad. Competition is not
scheduled to begin for several weeks
with the schedule resembling that of
the indoor season.

DICK STOUGHTON, curveball specialist, who is one of the key-
pegs of Coach J. Kyle Anderson’s Chicago Maroon baseballers. The
Maroons launch their season tomorrow against Illinois Tech. Stoughton,
a navy soph medic, is the squad’s lone returning major letterman.

College Opens Spring Season

With Baseball, Track, Tennis

With an 11 to 6 defeat at the hands of the Hyde Park high
school baseball team, the College athletic program opened its
spring activities in full force. 1

Coach Joe Stampf has an ample
supply of manpower, over 25 men, to
build a baseball team and Coach Paul
Derr has a heavy carryover from his
champion indoor track squad with
which to build an outdoor thinclad

team. Tennis is expected to start
within a short time and a number of [
men in the first two years of the
college have expressed a desire to
play varsity tennis. The main prob-
lem at the present time is in stretch-
ing the hard taxed coaching force
over all activities.

Stampf’s ball players face games
with Chicago Latin, Harvard and
Morgan Park Military Academy in a
space of the next three weeks wind-
ing up the season with a total of 10
games. Coach Derr’s runners open
with Concordia Academy and build up
their season to a finale at Champaign
in the State Championships. The
tennis squad will also be busy clos-
ing May 26 when all the private
schools in this district meet for the

Leageu championships.

Maroons Bristle With Power;
Anderson Sees Bright Season

By JACK HILL

(Sports Editor, Chicago Maroon)

The brightest assortment of baseball performers to wear
Chicago livery in the last few seasons opens its 1945 season
tomorrow at 2:30 against the untested, unknown Illinois Techawks
at Greenwood Field.

Fortified by thirty experienced ball chasers, Coach *J. Kyle
Anderson will field a nine that shows strength and depth in every
position.

The Illinois Tech team, hampered
by its lack of practice, is expected to
pvt up a strong fight. Coach W. J.
Weisman, Tech mentor, has a three
man nucleus composed of holdovers
from last year on which to build his
team. Bob Lichtman at first, Dick
Holstrom at third and Bob Sidham at
the catcher post are all V12 students
and represent the only experienced
men on whom Weisman can count.

By taking advantage of the
good weather during the past two
weeks, the Maroons have been
rounding into shape. The number
of discharged service men on the
squad and the consequent increase
in the average age of the team
has been very heartening to An-
derson. Several of the men have
seen action on service teams touch
as Camp Grant, Fort Sheridan*
Great Lakes, etc.

Kurt Smith, stocky third baseman,
was a regular on the strong Camp
Grant team last summer and Knapp,
Peliotes, Cimerblatt and Harrison
havez also played with government
teams. The pitching squad has devel-
oped into one of the strongest in re-
cent years, the team having both reg-
ular pitchers and several men who
play other positions and can take their
turn at the mound if necessary. Led
by Bill Knapp, Lefty Hauck and Dick
Stoughton, the moundmen have been
bolstered by Kurt Smith, Jay Barker
and one or two others. Knapp, a dis-
charged veteran, Hauck, fourth year
student and Stoughton, soph navy
medic student and major C winner
will probably make up the ‘Big Three’
in pitching this year.

Weather permitting, the game will
start at 2:30, tomorrow afternoon at
the Greenwood field. No admission is
charged and seating arrangements
have been made. With this game, the
season opener, it is the wish of both
Coach Anderson and his entire squad
that the students and faculty of the
University will support them in their
maiden effort.

The Chicago lineup follows:
Jim Peliotes.......... lb

John Cooperider..........2b

Jim Servies...............ss

Kurt Smith ..............3b

Bill Knapp ................If

Fred Cimerblatt ........cf

The current tentative schedule of
The Maroons, with negotiations for
several additional games now under
way, follows:
