Although at least eighteen

to accommodate the hundreds of

In Historic New Plea

For World Community

In an historic plea for “moral
leadership, integrity, and com-
mon sense in government,”
Chancellor Robert M. Hutchins
last night demanded that the
government devote • itself to,
“peace, prosperity and justice.”

His message, one of the most
searching and challenging sur-
veys of the world scene he has
ever made, was delivered at a
banquet at the Stevens hotel
sponsored by the National Citi-
zens Political Action Commit-
tee honoring Secretary of the
Interior Harold Ickes.

“The American people are not
entitled to expect superhuman sa-
gacity from the government but
we can demand that the govern-
ment devote itself to peace, pros-
perity, and justice,” Hutchins de-
clared.

Demands Vorld Leadership

He charged that “small time

politicians whose only purpose is
to stay in office” are dominating
the government and sabotaging a

program of peace and economic
plenty. “Justice like the Ten Com-
mandments and the Golden Rule
has become a rhetorical flourish,”
he asserted. “All that one hears
from Washington is the clash of
pressure groups by night. The
moral leadership to match our mil-
itary and industrial power is mis-
sing,” he declared.

Hutchins ripped both foreign
and domestic policies. He assailed
the mismanagement of the atomic
bomb; the abandonment of ration-
ing while millions starve; the
Nuremberg ex-post facto war guilt
trials; the unemployment menace;
the failure of the government to
crack down on monopolies; and
inadequate housing and education.
Pleas for World State

He reiterated his plea for a
world state and community. “We
can demand of our government,”

problem, not a veterans’ problem,”
Meyers asserted, “and the situa-

tion of all campus students.”

Registrar Named
Head of Science
Deferment Plan

By SHIRLEY ISAAC

Chicago students between 18 and 25 doing advanced work
in the field of the physical sciences may be eligible for draft
deferment, Ernest C. Miller, Registrar of the University, an-
nounced this week.

Miller, who is the newly designated representative of
Selective Service in handling stu-
dents’ draft problems, commented
that the new ruling would not
affect scientists over 25, who have
been exempt since the end of the
war.

Two new groups of students, he
said, may be considered for de-
ferment at the request of OWMR,

and scientific skills which may
have been acquired, and to provide

opened the housing campaign. He
urged passage of the Wagner-
Ellender-Taft Housing Bill, and
discussed the future of housing in
Chicago. “I am ashamed to pick
up a daily newspaper,” Dr. Wirth
said, “when I see advertisements
by veterans literally begging for
a place to live.”

Outlining the possibilities of
long-range housing in America, Dr.
Wirth declared: “This is a time

The University of Chicago has
contributed $14,149.18 to the Com-

politan Chicago, oversubscribing
its quota a week before the drive
ends on Dec. 17.

The University has always been
relied on for one-fourth of the
total quota assigned to educa-
tional institutions in Metropolitan
Chicago, and its contribution this
year is responsible for the fact
that the educational group has
already achieved 119 per cent of
its goal. The total contribution of
the city now stands at 90.1 per
cent of the goal of $5,817,000.

UC Settlement Board
Is Donor Recipient

Max Mertz, Chairman of the
University of Chicago Student
Settlement Board, announced
yesterday receipt of a donation
of the entire proceeds of a pub-
lic dinner held by the Esoteric
Club on December 3 at the Ida
Noyes Cloister Club.

A check of $50 was sent to
Mertz by A r 1 i n e Hawkins,
treasurer of the club.

history and function of co-opera-
tives were presented at the Co-op
Club when it met in the Reynolds
Club on Monday evening, Decem-
ber 3. The meeting was followed
by a square dance.

The Co-op Club, as explained
by its president, Jeanette Fiss, “is
an educational group set up to
spread knowledge and stimulate
thinking about co-operatives.”

The first report given at the
meeting described the history oi
the co-operative movement from
the eighteenth century mutual in-
surance companies through the
Rochdale co-operative stores down
to the present day. The Rochdale
principles which are still recog-
nized and used by co-operatives
throughout the world, include
democratic control (the right of
every member to have one, and
only one, vote), the return of gains
to members in proportion of their
patronage, and the pursuance of a
policy of anti-discrimation.

The report on the co-operative
dormitories at Chicago mentioned
the three women’s co-ops, Univer-
sity, Woodlawn and Kenell; Fel-
lowship, the only men’s co-op that
survived the war; and Concord, a
co-educational co-operative.

When the residents of the co-ops,
apprehended the postwar uncer-
tainties of renting, and decided to
buy a, house, they banded together

bers of the liberal political organ-
izations, meeting to plan the Inter-
national Students Day Assembly,
decided to sound out members of
the various campus organizations
on their willingness to co-operate
with each other. Since then, two
meetings have been held in Ida
NoyA Hall to plan an inter-organ-
izational council.

Tentative JPIans Formed

At the first meeting, a commit-
tee was appointed to formulate a
tentative plan of organization, and
the possible functions of the coun-
cil were discussed. It was decided
that the three major purposes of
the Council should be:

representatives to our last meet-
ing.”

“The great need on this campus
now is for a unification of student
opinion and action,” asserted
James Blaut, president of the La-
bor Rights. “I am convinced that
an inter-organizational council will
take the first great step in that
direction.”

Activities of the 223rd Convo-

different kinds of groups get
aquainted with each other. It
was felt that the social organ-
izations, the political organi-
zations, and the special inter-
est organizations could each
benefit from absorbing some
of the interests of the other
groups.

2.	To help each organization
publicize its activities and ob-
tain the co-operation of the
other groups on campus.

3.	To express student opinion on
both campus and off-campus
political issues.

gestions made by the planning
committee were voted on and it

Humboldt Party

Entertainment, singing, and re-
freshments are on the program
of the Humboldt Club Christmas
party, Friday, 7:30 p.m.

was decided that
should be headed by

an executive
of a presi-

ing secretary, to be elected by the
entire council, and the chairmen
of four committees, who would be
chosen by the committees. Every-
one in the council would be a
member of one committee, and
would be free to decide which one
to belong to.

Revised rushing rules for fra-

the limited number of third and
fourth year boys who will enter
the College at the winter quarter
and midterms.

The complete text of Chan-

dress to the National Political
Action Committee last night
at the Stevens Hotel follows:

The time has come for all
men of good will to stand up
and be counted, to say what kind
of country we are going to
have and what kind of world we
want. It is clear that we cannot
look to the Government in Wash-
ington to give us light and leading
on these issues. That Government,
though it is still distinguished by
the monolithic figure of the Old
Curmudgeon, is rapidly becoming
a Government of small-time poli-
ticians, whose only fixed purpose

Act Now-<?uasli an
Abortive Degree

The movement to abolish the Bachelor of Philosophy de-
gree and requiring every student to take the courses leading
to a Bachelor of Arts is a proposal which warrants support from
every thinking student in The College.

The content of a liberal education, as expressed in part by
the Bachelor of Arts degree, includes certain designated courses
which are held essential to the general education of any in-
dividual. If certain courses are not an integral part of the liberal
learning then the degree emblematic of general education
should be awarded without them.

In logic, a contradiction is a signal of defeat. The Bachelor
of Philosophy degree is a blatant contradiction to the entire
college plan. The existence of this degree implies that two of
the fourth year courses are not included in the content of a
liberal education. If they are a part of that training every
student should be required to take them; if they are not, the
Bachelor of Arts degree signifying the completion of a liberal
education should be granted without them. In either event,
the Ph. B. degree should go by the board.

We urge the faculty and the administration to act speedily
to resolve the paradox.

is to stay in office.

I do not deny that the Govern-
ment has from time to time talked
as though it had some higher aspi-
rations. It has said that it was for
fair employment practices, social
security, unemployment benefits,
medical care, and full employment.
But since the administration has
actually done nothing about any
of these matters, we can only con-
clude that the boys in the back
room have been tipped off that
they do not have to take these
professions seriously. These pro-
fessions are put forward only be-
cause there are some liberal votes
that are worth catching.

Sophistication in the Atomic Age

Don t worry, John; I'll coll The Motor Club

Raps Reactionaries

No one will suppose that

the

Problem-Solution

Administration authorities typify the three famed monkeys
of Confucious on one of the most critical problems confronting
the University. We refer to the lack of action in stemming the
rising tide of attempted attacks in recent weeks on University
women in the area of the Quadrangles. The women have
charged that it is unsafe to walk alone during the evening, and
they claim that police protection is either inadequate or im-
prudently employed.

The women have done more than merely phrase the issue,
however. They recommend that henceforth students travel in
groups during the evening to transportation facilities from
University centers such as Harper’s Library and Mandel Hall.
Thus a group of women would leave the library at 15-minute
intervals each evening after 9:15 for the Illinois Central and
Chicago surface line streetcar stops, and more distant dormi-
tories.

This might temporarily defray the necessity for obtaining
additional police personnel, difficult at best because of the
manpower question-marks. In the meantime, it would appear
wise to assign guards to such groups, and for the University
to establish the machinery for such group trips.

More intensive precautions to guard against recurrence of
recent molestation should be taken at once, whatever form the
precautions may take.

Maintain Squad Cars to
Police Campus After Dark

Measures taken by the University to police the campus
after dark were described to THE MAROON this week by
administrative authorities.

The University has operated a police car with armed
details on 59th street from 5:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m. every
day without interruption since October 9, 1944. This is in
addition to the regular University car and the police
patrols of the Woodlawn police district south of the Mid-
way, as well as police cars No. 44 and No. 109, and patrol-
men walking the beat along 59th Street.

way to get a liberal Government
is to vote the Republicans into
office. They do not even bother
to talk liberal. They feel that the
country is prepared for reaction,
and they are ready to supply it.
In a way they are right. The Re-
publicans will carry the House in
1946, because, if the country is
going to have reaction, it would
rather take it straight, and not
mixed with liberal doubletalk. Or,
to put it another way, the country
would rather take its reaction
from Taft and the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers than
from minor midgets like Bilbo,
Rankin, and Hannegan. If we are
going to have reaction, let us have
it from experts and those who
honestly believe it is good for the
country and not from those who
are ignorant of or indifferent to
any consideration but their own
publicity and power.

Hits A-Bomb Secret

The administration apparently
believes that the American people
are so stupid that they can’t tell
a reactionary Government when
they see one. Yet the issues are
what they have always been. They
are peace, prosperity, and justice.
By what a Government does, not
what it says, to promote peace,
prosperity, and justice, the Amer-
ican people are accustomed to
judge its character, and by these
tests they will have no difficulty
in pronouncing that the character
of this administration is bad.

The administration says that it
wants peace. It wants it so much
that it is willing to fight for it.
It will therefore build up the
largest army, navy, and air force
in the world. It will impose peace-
time conscription on the country.
It will keep the secret of the atom-
ic bomb, though it knows perfect-
ly well that there is no secret to
keep. By these means, and any
others that occur to it, it will
threaten the only other major
power in the world and thus do
everything it can to produce an
international alignment that will
lead inevitably to war.

The determination of our Gov-
ernment to rule the world by force

। Hence, every other nation will
, understand that our intentions are
peaceful, though our preparations
are warlike. But the devotion of
our Government to the Ten Com-
mandments and the Golden Rule
would seem to be something less
than fanatical. If we were truly
devoted to these great principles,
we would not claim for ourselves
what we deny to others. We would
not claim to control portions of the
earth in the name of our security
and deny other nations the right
to make similar claims in the
name of their security. If we were
truly devoted to Christian prin-
ciples, we would not have dropped
atomic bombs on an enemy whom,
according to our own announce-
ments, we had already defeated.
We would not have abandoned ra-
tioning until we were sure that
our fellow men had something to
eat. We would not have engaged
in the systematic starvation of the
German people. xWe would not be
sitting as a judge in our own cause
at Nuremberg, seeking to enforce

ex post facto law. We would
have committed that senseless
of savagery, the destruction of
Japanese cyclotrons.

In addition to its devotion to the
Ten Commandments and the Gold-
en Rule the administration is de-
voted to prosperity. One test of
prosperity is employment, and the
experts who think they ' know

employed witbin one year. Why

Authority would not have been
created if Mr. Truman had se-
riously wanted it? What about
monopoly? Isn’t it obvious that
the administration has put the
Anti-Trust Division quietly to
sleep since Thurmon Arnold left
the Government? If we are com-
mitted to the economic develop-
ment of the South and West why
should it be left to Governor
Arnall and Henry Kaiser to pro-
mote the freight rates and the
industries that will make this de-
velopment possible? What about
housing? Are veterans to live in
pup tents in public parks because
of the selfishness of capital and
labor and the indifference of the
Government?

Atomic Fission
Botched

The program of the Government
in regard to atomic energy com-
bines the worst features of its
foreign and domestic policies.
Here is the greatest discovery since

the discovery of fire. It has pos-
sibilities of increasing the goods
and the leisure of mankind beyond
anything we ever dreamed of.
What does the administration do
with this discovery? It treats it
as a weapon. By treating it as a
weapon the administration achieves
two objects which no Government
ought ever to entertain: it alarms
foreign nations, and it deprives
its own people of enormous bene-
fits. These are the results of a
foreign policy based on force and
a domestic policy characterized by
indifference to the needs of the
common man.

A foreign policy based on force
will not give us peace. A domes-
tic policy based on indifference to
the needs of the common man or
on the conciliation of vested in-
terests will not give us prosperity.
Both policies, moreover, are im-
moral. Justice requires that Gov-
ernment be dedicated to the com-
mon good, to the welfare of the
community as a whole. We cannot
have it both ways. We cannot say
we want a world community and
then prevent it from emerfi^ by
force of arms. We cannot say we
want an American communitv and
then disrupt it by maintaining
special privilege.

Education Unequal

Take the single issue of educa-
tion. Everybody knows that edu-
cation in the poor states does not
equal education in the rich states.
Everybody knows that the edu-
cation of Negroes is far worse than
that of whites. Everybody knows
that the amount of education a
young American obtains depends
upon the income of his parents.
Everybody knows, in short, that in
this land of opportunity education
is a special privilege of the for-
tunate. If, as John Stuart Mill
used to say, the principle object
of any government should be to
promote the virtue and intelli-
gence of the people, then the prin-
ciple object of our Government
should be to remove the inequal-
ities of educational opportunity
that have long disgraced the
United States. Such inequalities
are in the highest degree unjust.

But one hears little these days
from Washington, or little that
can be believed, about justice.
Justice, like the Ten Command-
ments and the Golden Rule, has
become a rhetorical flourish. All
that one hears from Washington
is the clash of pressure groups by
night. The moral leadership to
match our military and industrial
power is missing.

Unions Share Guilt

I do not deny that in the end
we get the kind of government
we deserve. I do not claim that
the administration should be made
the scapegoat for the sins of the
American people. The administra-

tion is not responsible for the ra-
cial and religious discrimination
that is rampant in this country.
The administration is not to blame
because our economy is a picture
of organized competition in greed.
It is the labor unions, and not the
administration, who want .to limit
the prosperity of Switzerland and
this country by limiting the im-
portation of Swiss watches. It
was a labor leader, and not Mr.
Truman, who, in opposing the re-
peal of the Chinese Exclusion Act,
answered the argument that China
was our ally by saying “A China-
man is still a Chinaman.” It was
the educators, and not the admin-
istration, who supported the Army
Enlisted Reserve Corps, which de-
ferred men from the draft merely
because they had money enough
to go to college. We all have a
tendency to confuse our special
interests with the common good.

'Face Facts of Life'

Precisely for this reason, to see
to it that nevertheless justice and
the common good prevail, govern-
ments were instituted among men.
We are not entitled to expect
superhuman sagacity from any
government. We do not expect
it now. But there are some things
we are entitled to demand, things
which are not beyond the reach
of the American people nor be-
yond the capacity of any govern-
ment. We can demand common
honesty. We can demand that the
Government mean what it says
and do what it says it is going to
do. We can demand common
sense. We can demand, for ex-
ample, that the Government
should not tell us in one breath
that there is no defense against
the atomic bomb and in the next
that we must have the largest
military force in the world to de-
fend ourselves against it.

We can demand that the Govern-
ment be the Government of the
whole people and that it develop
our resources, our science, and our
technology for the benefit of the
whole people. We can demand
that our Government face the facts
of life. We can demand that it
realize that the fate of civilization
depends upon our ability to or-
ganize, before we are destroyed
by atomic bombs, a world state, a
world Government, and a world
community. We can demand that
our Government take some visi-
ble steps toward achieving a world
Government, a world state, and a
world community.

We can demand that the Gov-
ernment dedicate itself to peace,
prosperity, and justice. It is the
business of independent groups of
citizens like this to make these
demands effective now.

Students Are Urged
To Avail 'Selves

Of Facilities

By LIBERO DE AMICIS

Assisting students, returned
service men, industrial personnel,
and members of the Chicago com-
munity in problems of personal
adjustment, is the aim of the
Counseling Center at The Univer-
sity of Chicago.

In newly decorated offices at
Lexington Hall, the Center will
also provide some of its facilities
for the training of students in the
counseling field.

The primary purpose of the
Center is to offer adjustment
counseling. This includes such
problems as difficulties in social
adjustment, failure to adjust to
academic work, inability to adjust
to a job, marital problems, prob-
lems of parent-child relationships,
worry and feelings of inadequacy,
uncertainties of aims and pur-
poses, and other personal prob-
lems.

If a student who has abilities,
and has passed his entrance and
placement examinations, finds dif-
ficulty in concentrating and study-
ing, the Counseling Center will at-
tempt to aid the student in over-
coming this problem.

These services are offered with-
out charge to students of the Uni-
versity of Chicago, but a fee, com-
puted on a cost basis, will be
assessed to others. The Center
realizes that some persons will be
unable to pay the fee for counsel-
ing, but others may wish to make
additional contributions to the
work of the Center.

If a person is undecided about
using the services of the Center,
he may make an appointment for
a preliminary interview. There
is no charge for this type of inter-
view. If the individual has a
problem in other fields, such as
vocational guidance, psychiatry
and remedial reading, the Center
will refer that person to other
appropriate facilities of the Uni-
versity of Chicago.

The Center has its main office
in Lexington Hall, but a down-
town branch has been established
at University College, 19 South
LaSalle Street.

Members of the Counseling staff
are: Willard W. Blaesser, Director
of the Counseling Center; Carl R.
Rogers, Executive Secretary of the
Committee on the Counseling Cen-
ter; Arthur L. Assum, Counselor;
Virginia M. Axline, Research As-
sociate; June B. Cochran, Research
Assistant; Gayle K. Lumry, Psy-
chometrist; Virginia C. Madigan,

Back in
Classroom

Here’s another person who
went to the U. of C. . . . ecology,
cell physiology, and inverte-
brates. . . . Just back from the
army where he was working on
the survival of Air Force men
in the Arctic, tropics, and des-
erts. ... Is now acting chairman
of the Bi Sci course. . . . Born in
Oklahoma (“doesn’t count, I
only spent a year there”). . . .
Father was a medical officer, so
as a child spent several years in
the Philippines. . . . Has a wife
and two children . . .

Thinks students ought to be im-
pressed with the subject matter of
a course and not the instructor’s
personality. ... (So don’t be sur-
prised if you find out a lot about
the Bi Sci course now.) . . . Here
goes . . . “Best course we’ve been
able to produce to date” . . . (You
see, he’s a believer in evolution,
as a matter of fact it’s even af-
fected his diagrams—they evolve
right before the eyes of his
classes.) . . . Concerning the phi-
losophy behind the Bi Sci course
he says, “Man has always asked
questions about himself and na-
ture, so just as in the Humanities
they read the ‘great books’; in
Bi Sci we take up the ‘great ques-
tions.’ . . . We want to give the
best answers and most of all the
methods by which the answers are
found. . . . We try to use original
materials as far as possible, the
phenomena themselves, and here’s
where the improvement can come
in . . . want to get more and more
direct observation of phenomena
by the students.” . . . Speaking of
improvements . . . “Bi Sci is sub-
ject to change at any time, we
consider suggestions from anyone,
from chancellor to janitor.” . . .
Right now a study of student opin-
ion is being made. . . . The texts
are definitely not old-fashioned
. . . for instance, take Dr. Buchs-
baum’s Animals Without Back-
bones . . . (with the intriguing
Platyhelminthes on the cover,
among other things) . . . they are
original works. . . .

He’s not doing any research at
the moment. . . . “I’m overloaded”
(anyone want a job?) . . . His
ideal science curriculum: one year
of basic sciences, one year of phys-
ical sciences, and topping it off, a
year of biological sciences. . . .
Maintains that if everyone were
honest we wouldn’t need comps,
but in a complex society we do
need them. . . . (Ah, for a simple
society.)

Corrections

Last week we missed another member of Mademoiselle’s College
Board—Pauline Mathewson of Beecher also won a place. The so-called
Neo-Druids of Int. House have registered a complaint with us to the
efffect that they really aren’t Neo, just a modern branch of the ancient
Druids who flourished bloodily in pagan times. We beg their pardon
humbly and hope that we will not be chosen as the sacrificial offering
for the next Halloween midnight orgy.

The Sigma Chis seem to be popular boys—parties with the Wyverns

Ann Bokman, Carol Dragstedt, and Jane Little . . . Betty Plasman and

Amusing Errors

Each year the student directory comes out with something interest-
ing to the public and infuriating to the victim of the error—this time
it’s Pat O’Halloran, who is not only listed as Mrs. but also apparently
lacks a phone number. Rather discouraging isn’t it? One med student
at Int. House is currently chewing his nails in futile wrath—he got a
bill from the housekeeping department charging him $1.00 for “one
curtain damaged by pet rat.” It isn’t the dollar that’s bothering him
though—it’s the fact that the housekeeping department called his litle
white mouse a rat.

Here and There

There’s a faded sign somewhere on campus that advertises Squirt—
“It hits your eye!” ... The Phi Delts of Chicago and Northwestern
threw a joint party last Saturday night.. . Lois Noakes will be married
the 29th in Taylor Chapel . . . The Dekes invaded their old home (now
Duke House) last Friday and were seen openly to shed a few nostalgic
tears over the old days . . . Bruce, the Phi Psi’s dog, is still wandering
around homeless and supposedly still hasn’t learned to answer to any-
thing but Greek and Latin . . . Dick Voegelli and Rosemary Cronin
are engaged . . . The Delta Sigs and the Tau Sigs pledges gave parties
for the actives last week as did the Wyvern pledges.

Too Much for Him

A hard studying med student just cracked under the strain the other
day. Tired of beating the books, he opened a box his grandmother sent
him and found one of the five-cent variety of lollipops. Armed with
it, he strolled into the room of one of his friends where he found some
Raggedy Ann books which said friend had bought as Christmas pres-
ents for his niece. He got engrossed in the book and was sitting there,
licking the lollipop, when his friends came in. From latest reports, he
is still languishing in a strait jacket.

Addenda

The duck call business has had a boom lately—one of our contribu-

window at Int. House. No less than five ducks seeking sanctuary from

William Wambaugh

The Critic s Corner

Two masterpieces of chamber music were brought to a
much-needed hearing by the last concert in the Autumn Quar-
ter section of the University College series.

Mozart’s QUARTET NO. 2 IN E FLAT, K. 493, for piano,
violin, viola, and ’cello, and Dvorak’s QUINTET IN A, OP. 81,

for piano and string quartet re-
ceived vigorous and direct per-
formances, although the Mozart
lacked polish in the strings at
times.

Perry O’Neil, graduate student
in the Department of Music, was
the pianist, and Franz Polesny,
violinist, Milton Preves, violist,
and Dudley Powers, ’cellist, as-
sisted in the Mozart. They were
joined by John Weicher, violinist,
in the Dvorak. The Mozart quartet,
one of a pair, is one of Mozart’s
most carefully wrought works and
is much superior to its companion
in G Minor which is to be per-
formed on campus next quarter.
The G Minor quartet is labored
and padded with passage work.
The E Flat quartet flows freely,
by contrast, and enjoys more in-
teresting themes. The finale is a
brilliant rondo which Mozart
originally intended for one of his
piano concertos and in which the
piano is easily a solo instrument.
The finale has a sparkling vivacity
to make it one of the composer’s
most ingratiating compositions.
Unfortunately, the strings had a
coarse, rasping tone which some-
what marred the work’s first and
second movements.

The Dvorak Quintet, performed
as a specimen of the Romantic
flowering, had all the lushness
and over-written character of the
later Dvorak. When I say “over-
written” I mean a striving for
effects not natural to the combin-
ation employed. Dvorak and his
contemporaries tried to make
chamber music an imitation of
orchestral music, and sometimes
were successful, as here. Often,

however, the attempt was unsuc-
cessful, as in Smetana’s Quartet
No. 1, where an attempt is made
to imitate a village brass band at
a fair. A later stage of Romanti-
cism, illustrated by Elgar’s Quin-
tet, would have more successfully
illustrated the full extent of this
trend in writing and would have
offered a work less episodic than
the Dvorak.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Half Million

Each Year in

Scholarships

More than a half million dollars
are distributed by the University
for scholarships and fellowships in
student aid each year. This year,
because of printing delays and
limited housing and administra-
tive facilities, the mid-year schol-
arship exams were not heavily
publicized. One hundred seventy-
five students here and elsewhere
took the test; however the number

of scholarship winners has not yet
been announced.

This method of securing a
scholarship is comparatively new.
Until a few years ago, scholar-
ships were granted on two bases
—by examination and by applica-
tion. Now, however, anyone de-
siring a scholarship must first ap-
ply for admission and then take a
four-hour test which reveals any
of the student’s special intellectual
abilities. Students who make the
best grades in the test are awarded
scholarships.

Returning G.I.’s may also take
tests for entrance and other schol-
arships. If their scores are high
enough and if their need is great

of course, are in addition to
assistance received through
G.I. Bill of Rights.

Many students not receiving

the
the

en-

trance scholarships are awarded
LaVerne Noyes Foundation Honor
Scholarships. These are awarded
on the same basis as other schol-
arships, but, in addition, the ap-
plicant must be a direct blood de-
scendant of a man or woman who
served five or more months in the
United States Armed Forces dur-
ing the first World War, and who
was inducted prior to May 11,1918,
or served overseas prior to the
Armistice.

About one out of every six en-

enough, they may be awarded trims siuunna
scholarships. These scholarships, | of scholarship.

Radio Midway On Air;
Limited to B-J court

On Monday, December 3, Radio Midway had its initial
broadcast. Students of Burton-Judson found that its own radio
station, owned and operated by students, had become a reality

The station operates on a wave length of 610 kilocycles
and is on the air from 7:45 to 10 o’clock every weekday.

Future programs are headed by
a “great books” course of the air,
featuring Dean Kimpton and Mr.
Wilkinson, plays and songs by
McLeish, and appearances of Ar-
thur Wiesender, whose rendition
of “The Emperor’s New Clothes”

was one of the program highlight
this week.

The group hopes to be able to
reach the rest of the campus by
next quarter, but at the moment
can be heard only over Burton-
Judson radio receivers, where re-
ception is very clear.

good football in the entire season.

NEW METHOD OF JUDGING

During each week of the football season.







coaches watched with trained eyes every
man who looked like All-American
material. Week after week, these re-
ports were filed with the Association,
tabulated, and returned to the coaches
for a careful study and a final, end-of-
season vote.

The men who made this final All-

State Teachers’ College.

The game will be the fifth of the
year for Chicago. During the week
The Maroons defeated Vaughan
General Hospital and Chicago
Naval Reserve, while losing to
Illinois Tech in a return game.

Western Illinois State, though
defeated by Northwestern, is re-
garded as one of the stronger
squads of the area.

Coach Nels Norgren will prob-
ably start Sharp, DeGraw, Raby,
Freeark, and Lilien, though Buos-

Women Cagers Are
Urged to Register

Women’s basketball teams

are

requested by the Women’s Ath-
letic Association to sign up, giving
the captain’s name, if possible, on
a poster displayed in Ida Noyes
Hall. Teams in each of the two
leagues—residence halls (College),
and Divisional, should be listed
separately.

Fine

Time

Not so many MAROONS
ago this column called attention
to the impending annual Win-
ter meeting of the Big Ten
and to the athletic eligibility
problems that had to be settled
at that time. Last week-end West-
ern Conference officials voted a
back to normalcy program, effec-
tive as soon as possible.

More specifically, the ten mem-
ber schools decided to return
after 1946 to the pre-war fresh-
man rule which requires one year
of residence as a pre-requisite to
all eligibility; and effective im-
mediately to limit competition for
each athlete to three years exclu-
sive of a freshman year of com-
petition under the wartime ruling.

The first problem was settled
to everyone’s satisfaction. Schools,
like the U. of C., who have been
counting on freshmen to play a
major role in winter and spring
sports will not be disappointed.
Even those schools which still
boast of football teams will have
first year students playing varsity
ball next fall as the rule isn’t
effective until the start of the cal-
endar year 1947.

However, the return to the three
year rule has some rather serious
implications for several schools
including Chicago. It comes as
somewhat of a disappointment to
Wally Hebert, varsity tennis coach,
who had counted on the return
of at least two peace-time net
stars to elevate the Maroons to
their former pre-eminent position
in the tennis world.

More immediately, it throws the
proverbial monkey-wrench into
the smooth-working Iowa basket-
ball machine eyeing its second
consecutive Big Ten title. At least
three of the Hawkeyes are now
ineligible. Michigan too can cry
“we wuz robbed.” Twins Ross and
Bob Hume of track fame have run
their last college mile.

Nevertheless, in spite of the in-
dividual injustices that may re-
sult from the re-adoption of this
rule, this column is in very de-
finite agreement with the deci-
sion. College athletics already
stink too much of professionalism.
When a university is permitted to
bribe its athletes to return to the

Big 10 Card
Approved by
The Maroons

At the Big Ten Conference
meetings last week, the coaches of
the different sports met and draft-
ed schedules for all winter and
spring sports.

Chicago, although hampered by
a shortage of manpower, decided
to have complete schedules in both
indoor and outdoor track, baseball
and tennis. Because of a shortage
of swimmers, a modified swim-
ming circuit has been made. Meets
in fencing, gymnastics and wres-
tling are short because of lack of
schools competing.

Chicago will have no golf team
because of the difficulty in reach-
ing a course.

amateur athletics even beyond
what subsidies and athletic scho-
larships have already done. We
can only hope that the rest of the
country will soon follow the ex-
ample set by the Big Ten.

With wire scarce and wartime calls increasing,
telephone engineers made existing pairs of long
distance wires carry nearly four times as many
calls as before. This was done through installa-
tion of additional carrier equipment, requiring
closer spacing of the wires on the line and trans-
positions at shorter intervals^

Three pairs on the Southern Transcontinental
Route were rearranged, and in a 430-mile section
this had to be done while keeping the urgently
needed wires in service all the time. To do this,
new tools and new methods had to be devised
in the laboratories and on the job.

This is another among many examples of how
Bell System teamwork and engineering skills
maintained telephone service under wartime
conditions.
