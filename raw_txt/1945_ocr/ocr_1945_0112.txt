Trustees’ Plan
Forward Step,
Says Hutchins

In his address to the annual Trus-
tee-Faculty dinner, held Wednesday,
President Robert M. Hutchins com-
mended the plans for the reorganiza-
tion of the University Senate recently
adopted by the Board of .Trustees a
new chance for achieving the integra-
tion necessary for future progress.
He again criticized the tendency in
higher education toward over-special-
ization, a tendency which, he declared,
“has promoted the extinction of liber-
al education.”

Maintaining that a principal func-
tion of the university is the transmis-
sion, criticism, development, and sys-
tematization of the culture of the
race, he continued, “I venture to say
that this kind of synthetic, general-
ized scholarship which aims to trans-
mit, criticize, and develop the culture
is not merely non-existent in this
country; it is not even respectable, so
complete has been the victory of spe-
cialization.” He further stated that
this very task, the search for stand-
ards, ends, and goals, has never been
so important as it is today. “The
world is crashing about us,” he assert-
ed. “The moral fabric which we call
civilization is falling apart. If the
new world which is coming is to be
civilized, it must in some way or oth-
er formulate and make effective the
ideas which are to guide human life
and mould society.”

Speaking of the College of the Uni-
versity, President Hutchins pointed
out that although the aim of the Col-
lege plan is to give every citizen a
liberal education, admission require-
ments have been raised to a point
where only students of relatively high
intelligence can benefit by the plan.
“What about citizens of relatively low
intelligence?” he asked. “Can they
be educated for citizenship, or must
we train them to be self-supporting
and let it go at that? If they are
to be educated for citizenship, where
and by what methods shall it be done ?
To these questions we have no an-
swers.”

Dr. A. C. McGiffert, Jr. New
Head Of Theological Seminary

Dr. Arthur Cushman McGiffert, Jr.,
has been elected to the presidency of
the Chicago Theological Seminary and
will begin active duty on January 1
of next year. Until that date Dr. Al-
bert W. Palmer will remain in office.

Dr. McGiffert held the position of
professor of theology at the Seminary
for thirteen years. Since 1939 he has
held the presidency of the Pacific
School of Religion, where he will re-
main for a few months in order to al-
low the school time to select and in-
stall a new leader.

He received his A. B. at Harvard,
where he was elected to Phi Beta Kap-
pa, and has also studied for a year
in the American School of Archaeol-
ogy in Athens, and the Harvard Di-
vinity School. His B.D. was received
at the Union Theological Seminary
in New York and his M.A. from Co-
lumbia University. He was awarded
the honorary degree of Doctor of Di-
vinity from The Chicago Theological
Seminary in 1939.

Student Self-Government

Wins Growing Support

New Committee
To Support
College Council
by Abe Krash

The movement to initiate a genuine
student government to lift University
of Chicago student activities out of
the doldrums lunged forward under
new impetus this week.

A major development sent aspira-
tions for formulating a student gov-
ernment within a short time soaring
skyward and there were bright pros-
pects that the question would be
brought to a head in the immediate
future.

The program launched in a wide-
spread editorial campaign in the fall
quarter by the Chicago Maroon served
as the core for a platform presented
this week to a faculty committee by a
group of three interested college stu-
dents. Conferring with an investigat-
ing board headed by Professor Russell
W. Thomas to urge the creation of
student government were Charles
Schwartz, Joan Beckman, and Lenore
Callahan.

The committee, it was learned, was
spontaneous and its proposals, while
sketchy, were received with favor by
the Thomas committee.

Coincident with the announcement
that it had met with the Thomas
board, the three students, who em-
phasized that they have no official
connections or “go ahead” authority,
sounded a call for interested students
to meet with to frame a final platform
which will then be presented to the
faculty committee for action.

In this regard, it is not known at
this time what procedure will be uti-
lized to bring about adoption of this
plan. Dean Lawrence A. Kimpton who
has given plans a shot in the arm
more than once with assurances of
full support from his office, has urged
that the organization be spontaneous

(Continued on page three)

In 1917 Dr. McGiffert was ordained
as a Congregational Minister and
served as a chaplain with the rank of
lieutenant in World War I. From
1920 to 1926 he was pastor of All
Souls Church, Lowell, Massachusetts,
and in 1926 was called to the chair of
Christian Theology at The Chicago
Theological Seminary.

He is the author of an authoritative
book on Jonathon Edwards. Other
books which he has edited include
“Christianity as History and Faith”
and “Young Emerson Speaks.” His
field of specialization has been the
development of American religious
thought.

Dr. Palmer, who is retiring from
the presidency in accordance with the
age limitations rule of the Seminary,
will probably continue after January
1, 1946, in some form of active relig-
ious service yet to be determined, but
does not plan to remain in the Chica-
go area. He has served as president
since 1930.

Socialist League

Lectures Begin

“Turmoil in Europe” will be

the

topic discussed by Irwin Suall of New
York, national organizer for the
Young People’s Socialist League, Mon-
day night, at 7 o’clock in Social Sci-
ence 107. Suall will discuss allied
policy in Greece, Poland, Belgium, and
Italy at the first of a series of open
lectures sponsored by the Socialist
Club. Admission is free.

In its first meeting of the quarter,
Socialist Club elected the following
officers: Ann Morrissett, Chairman;
Mary Shannon, Secretary; and Elea-
nor Guttman, Educational Director.

Gates Hall

House Council
Leads the Way!

by Zonabel Kingery

Precipitated by recent editorials in
the Chicago Maroon, plans for a dor-
mitory council are being crystalized
this week and positive steps toward
its formation are being taken.

After a discussion of the values of
inter-dormitory cooperation, the Gates
Hall Council voted Tuesday night to
meet with officers of the other women’s
residence halls for further action.

The process of developing an effic-
ient student government, a student
government that is more than a mere
figurehead, is one of evolution. The
most natural and effective place for
such a process to begin is in the
residence halls.

Accordingly, invitations have been
extended to the officers of Beecher,
Blake, Foster, Gates, Green, and Kelly
Halls for a meeting to be held this
Wednesday evening at 8:30 in Gates
Hall.

Simultaneous with the action of the
women was the statement of John
Yarnelle, Acting Director of Residence
Halls, that a full program of activity
would be spurred by a Burton-Judson
Council. He also indicated that resi-
dents of Burton Court favor a plan
providing for inter-dormitory action.

House committees of both the men’s
and women’s dormitories have been
asked to attend a general meeting
sponsored by the Maroon for coordina-
tion of various proposals. This meet-
ing will be held in the Burton Court
East Lounge on January 24 at
8:00 p.m.

The current spurt of enthusiasm
in this and other activities directed
toward eventual student government
is indicative of a gradual process of
integration of College life.

“Trade Union”

Lecture Series
Begins Thurs.

The changing economic role

O1

trade unionism will be discussed next
Thursday evening by Frederick Har-
bison, assistant professor of econom-
ics, in the first of three lectures on
trade unionism sponsored by Labor
Rights Society.

Mr. Harbison, head of the newly
formed Industrial Relations Center,
will give his talk in Social Science 106
at 7:30. Reinhard Bendix and G. E.
O. Meyer will lead the two following
discussions in this series on the ideals
and political activities of trade un-
ions.

At the last meeting of Labor
Rights Society, largest politically ac-
tive student body on campus, Ursula
Wolf was elected president; Merle
Rogers, vice-president; Malkah Tol-
pin, secretary; and Ruth Kornhauser,
treasurer. Jim Blout is executive
member-at-large.

Colonel Evans F. Carlson, leader of
the famed Carlson’s Raiders, will
speak at 4:30 this afternoon in Man-
del Hall.

Recently returned from the South
Pacific war theater, Colonel Carlson
will speak on “The People’s War in
Eastern Asia.” The lecture will be
open to the public without admission
charge or ticket. '

Carlson, a veteran of World War I,
was placed in command of the Second
Raider Battalion with the rank of
lieutenant colonel in 1942. His lead-
ership of that unit on Makin Island
on August 17, 1942, won him a Gold
Star in lieu of a second Navy Cross,
and a second Gold Star was awarded
him for personal heroism and distin-
guished leadership on Guadalcanal in
November and December, 1942.

Returning to Tarawa after medical
treatment in the United States in
1943, he was cited for volunteering to
carry vital information through ene-
my fire from an advance post to divi-
sion headquarters. He was wounded
during the Saipan operations and was
given a Gold Star instead of a second
Purple Heart.

Colonel Carlson has spent many
years in the Asiatic area during his
military career which started in 1912.
He has studied Chinese and Chinese
methods of fighting as well as the
tactics used by Japanese soldiers.

Red Cross Sponsors
First Ard Course

The campus unit of the Red Cross
is sponsoring a twenty hour course
in first aid beginning this Tuesday,
January 16. The meetings will be
held in Ida Noyes from 7:00 till 10:00

The Home Nursing course, also
sponsored, by the Red Cross, is still
open to those who have missed the
first meeting.. It is possible for those ,
who wish to continue to make up this
deficiency at a later date.

ODP Will Move
Back into Old
Office in Tower

Since the spring of 1943 the De-
partment of Meteorology has occu-
pied the Reynolds Club, the theatre

and the Tower Room. Early this
week, however, it was announced that
the Office of Dramatic Productions
will again have its offices in the Rey-

nolds Club. The Tower Room will
not be vacated until February 1, but
the theatre, which was previously
used as a drafting room, will be va-
cated next week. On January 22, the





North Lounge on the first floor will

be evacuated, and the lobby will no
longer be restricted. The Navy, how-



ever will retain the billiard room on
the second floor, and the third floor
offices.

The schedule of plays to be pre-
sented by O.D.P. in the theatre is
still uncertain, but will probably be-
gin with “Driftwood”, a new play by
Maurice Dunn.

THE CHICAGO MAROON -----------------------—_

Carillon Editor Lashes Back at All
Critics In Open Letter To Maroon

by Marjorie Ladd Brown

A number of criticisms, undeserved
and unfounded, pertaining to the pub-
lication, Carillon, have convinced its
Editors that a clarifying discussion
of the issues is imperative, if further
misconceptions are to be eliminated.

One such recurring criticism of
Carillon maintains that its failure to
achieve recognition as a top-ranking
literary magazine is the fault of its
Staff in not formulating and adhering
to a high standard. Such a state-
ment is entirely without validity, but
more important, it reveals how little
of the problem is understood by the
disciples of this view. The members
comprising the Carillon staff are unit-
ed in the desire for a successful liter-
ary magazine. Allegiance to this com-
mon cause was not the sole determin-
ing factor in their election to office,
however; each member was selected
on the basis of previous experience
in a particular field, which would en-
able him to analyze and judge critic-
ally a specific kind of writing or art
and thereby choose the best contribu-
tions for publication. But this has
no bearing on the cause of Carillon’s
failure to “arrive”. For, regardless
how high the standards of the Editors
are, it is the quantity and quality of
contributions received which set the
value by which the staff must inev-
itably abide.

A non-profit magazine, unaided by
subsidies, dependent upon voluntary
and unpaid contributions, is obviously

handicapped and can print only that
material which is duly submitted. It
is also incontrovertible that if the
manuscripts are few, thus limiting the
choice of the Editors, and the calibre
of the work is below their standards,
these Editors have no alternative but
to print the best which has been re-
ceived, however poor. If a Staff, com-
posed of the country’s foremost men
of letters, were installed to govern
Carillon, as conditions presently exist,
the situation would not be improved.

There is, the Editors firmly believe,
a solution to change these circum-
stances—a simple, easy remedy. It
is contained in the word cooperation
—not of the few, but the many.

If the all-too-eager critics who em-
ploy so much time penning pointless
and useless invectives against Carillon
would devote their efforts toward stim-
ulating and promoting student inter-
est and pride in this publication
(which is, after all, representative
of them and their university), many
of the ills bemoaned would be cured.
This remark necessitates qualification
and exclusion, and the Editors of
Carillon take this opportunity to ex-
press appreciation to John Harmon
for his constructive and intelligent
criticism of the Autumn magazine con-
tents.

This spirit of cooperation should
establish an alliance between Carillon
and the University newspaper: that
the paper work in conjunction with
the Editors in their attempts to evoke
literary interest and activity among
students.

If the persons who are so disturbed
about the quality of the magazine,
utilized their efforts to encourage con-
tributors of talent to cooperate with
the Staff, they would not find the
Editors remiss in the performance of
their duties towards producing a suc-
cessful Carillon.

If the reputation of the magazine
has been unsavory, if the circulation
has been such that “successful writ-
ers” would not condescend to submit
material, then these unpleasant con-
ditions can readily be resolved by these
same authors lending their good names
and meritorious works to Carillon to
counteract its deficiencies. Then, and
only then, will these problems be effec-
tively and conclusively eliminated.
However, if such contributors do exist
and their cooperation is not forth-
coming, the name of the magazine
could be changed, but the reputation
would not be improved; a different
staff could be instigated, but this
would not materially affect circula-
tion.—In short, student activity and
interest are the controlling factors in
the success or failure of Carillon, as
with any other publication owned and
operated by the students in a univer-
sity, all theories hitherto expounded
by the many critics to the contrary
notwithstanding.

Relative to another important mis-
conception brought to the attention
of the Staff: that Carillon is an ex-
clusive organ of the College—the Ed-

’’tors wish to assure the students of
the Divisions that such rumor has no
basis in fact. Carillon is the property
of all students of this University and
no such restriction obtains. Any stu-
dent enrolled in the University of
Chicago, whether of the Division or
College may and is welcomed to con-
tribute to Carillon. Nor do there exist
any limitations as to kind, number or
frequency of manuscripts which may
be submitted.

For the. convenience of both con-
tributors and Staff, manuscripts may
be sent to the Carillon by addressing
them to Box 31, Faculty Exchange.
Contributions are now being accepted
for consideration for the Winter edi-
tion. In order to expedite the work
of editing, the Staff requests that the
following rules be observed in prepar-
ing manuscripts: Material typed, if
possible; writing on one side of paper
only; lines double-spaced; pages num-
bered ; author’s name, address and
telephone number on title page to
facilitate communication for confer-
ence, and, as a protection against loss,
contributors should retain a carbon
copy of all material.

It is the collective hope of Carillon’s
editors that, in view of the facts
herein presented, a better understand-
ing of the situation will evolve among

the students and that Carillon
emerge a creditable tribute to
University, as a result of this
perspective.

(Ed. note—The above article

will

new

was

submitted by Mrs. Brown, and we
print it in an effort to explore and
present all shades of opinion regarding
the future of Carillon. We feel that
not only the publication problems, but
the very existence, of a high quality
and representative literary magazine
are matters of major concern to the
entire campus. We welcome and will
gladly publish further comment of a
congruent nature.)

Vocational Board
Opens Opportunities
To June Graduates

The Board of Vocational Guidance
and Placement is again urging all
students who will receive degrees by
June of 1945, and are interested in
permanent employment, to register
now.

The opportunity of being interview-
ed by representatives of large, well
known industrial and business firms
from all over the country is one which
the student should not overlook. It
not only offers potential employment,
but gives the individual a bird’s eye
view of his vocational field. This
broad survey will enable him to choose
more wisely when accepting u posi-
tion.

To make the best possible use of
this service, it is advisable to regis-
ter immediately. To do so, men
should contact Mr. Calvin, and wom-
en, Miss Fox, both in Cobb 215.

“We are interested in foisting no
program on the students,” he has
declared. It is thus assumed that a
referendum will be called for the stu-
dent body to approve, amend, or reject
a final plan.

The Chicago Maroon focused the
cherry-hot searchlight of publicity on
the lack of such an organization which
would coordinate student activities.
The newspaper has had under study
the constitutions of various other mid-
western universities, but its purpose
in its editorial campaign has been not
so much to present a final plan for
action as to spur student thought
which in turn can assume the initia-
tive for bringing about a student gov-
ernment in the University. Said
Maroon editor Frederick Gottesman
this week: “Such an organization is
vital if we are to bring to an end
the confusion and uncertainty which
currently exists in college life.

appointed by Kimpton to probe the
problem, include in addition to Thomas

Congdon Discusses
Semantics’ Place

In Educational Field

Dr. Charles B. Congdon, psychia-
trist of the Student Health Service,
will be featured on February 23 in
the third of a series of lectures on se-
mantics, entitled “New Attitudes for
a Changing World. He will discuss
“General Semantics in Education.”

The lecture series, to be held over
a three month period at 32 West Ran-
dolph Street at 8 P.M., is sponsored
by the Society for General Semantics.
This series will feature five of the
leading experts in the field and is
designed primarily for those with no
previous knowledge of the subject.
Advance students will also find it
helpful, for the lectures will empha-
size uses of semantics in familiar life
situations. Tickets may be obtained
from Mrs. Harry Johnson, Cabb 105.

launched on campus February 6.

A Poster Party sponsored by Alice
Sheeham, Art Chairman, will hold
forth in the East Lounge of Ida Noyes
tonight at 7 o’clock. The purpose of
the party will be to start work on
Art Publicity for the drive. Any per-

Dormitory Council Soon?

: Although the Chicago Maroon initiated consideration of prob-
lems pertaining to the formation of a dormitory council several
mdnths ago and continued discussion of these matters during much
of last quarter, there was disappointing lack of general response
on the part of most students. However, the new quarter has
brought about several encouraging developments in behalf of a
dormitory council, which leads us to state without any undue
optimism, that the quarter’s end will see the formation of that
council.	. ’

t . ■ At the present writing, we have been informed that Gates
Hall has already considered the question of participating in the
formation of a council and has strongly endorsed the council
principle.. We further, understand that Beecher is also in favor
of a council (though no formal action has been taken as yet), and
plans are now in the making for a meeting among all six women’s
dormitories to pursue ’the question in greater detail and with
Wider collaboration. This is thoughtful and concrete action of a
piost enheartenjng nature.

Moreover, the- Maroon will hold a meeting for all House Com-
hiittees on January 24 at 8:00 p.m. in the East Lounge of Burton
Court for the express purpose of coordinating the efforts of the in-
diyidpai groups- and- to consider specific proposals regarding the
faake-up and functions of the dormitory council. However, this will
represent merely a good beginning unless the students, generally,
give the problem of a dormitory council genuine thought and whole-
sale support.1 The time for “why dormitory council” has passed;
only “when” remains.. :

“ Ori various dCc&fcions we have been questioned at length on
wliat would make a legitimate program of action for a dormitory
council.' There are three areas for immediate consideration,
-which, if followed by prompt action, could more than justify the
existence of a dormitory council by virtue of its value to the
University. For almost a year and a half, a quasi-experimental
housing program has been underway in the first two years of the
College.- It is full time that a student evaluation of this program
be undertaken, and, if it is found at all worthy, necessary steps
should be taken to recommend its extension to the last two years of
the College. The dormitory council is the logical instrument to per-
form both functions.

For more years than we care to remember, the commuter has
been the forgotten student on campus. Where other universities
have established recreational facilities especially for their com-
muters, this university has nothing. Where other institutions of
higher learning have provided extra-curricular programs designed
primarily for commuter-student participation, the University of
Chicago, with more than 50% of its College students commuting
daily, has done less than nothing. What better purpose could a
dormitory council serve than providing associate memberships in
the various houses to the off-campus student, so that he, too, may
participate fully in student life?

Finally, there is the matter for council consideration of policy
regarding hours regulations. A council could propose, execute and
enforce an • acceptable policy of liberalizing and grading hours
regulations; and yet remain congruent with University policy anc
responsibility. One of the first points of consistency would be the
evolution of a policy of regulation whereby the schism between
-the first two years and the last two years of the College could be
materially lessened. This could be done by eliminating the unfor-
itunate distinctions caused by stringent regulations in the first
itwo years, and an abrupt absence of regulation in the’ last two.
iWhat is needed , is a system of graded regulation, progressively
decreasing year by year through all four years of the College.
[Again, it is to the dormitory council that we must look for such
an accomplishment.; ‘

Almost all that’s new this week
deals with weddings and engage-
ments. Jean Gilruth and George
Shanks (formerly a meteorologist
here) became officially engaged—she
received her ring from the postman
since George has a little business at
a P.O.E. Gates Hall is giving a par-
ty Monday for its engaged and mar-
ried denizens—among them Alice Ol-
son (now Mrs. James J. Bonga) and
Betty Mann who’s decided on the
lucky man.

Surprise of the week came with the
announcement of Veva Hopkins’s en-
gagement to George R. Schreiber (the
middle name is Richard). Marines
Ginny Coward (Delta Sigma) and
Gene Gleason (DU) were married last
Saturday—she’s a sergeant and he’s a
looie. We wonder who’ll be boss...
Ruth Schroeder has been married
since last Jan. 24th to Lieutenant
(j.g.) just returned from overseas
duty.

Things are Tough Dept.

Before he left for the army in Jan-
uary, Steve Sobotka took his father
down to the Chinese laundryman and I
very ceremoniously introduced them
... It seems the laundryman refuses
to accept laundry from any unknowns
and since Steve usually took the
laundry, Mr. Sobotka ranked as an
outsider.

We hear that Bud Reinhardt was
wandering around the third floor at
Gates the other day (he says he was
carrying Marcia Fromkin’s suitcase

shortage seem more serious, the
Commons is now keeping the hand-
some bus boys in the kitchen (we
have heard several complaints).

“There’s nothing like starvation for
the constitution,” Otto always says.
Provided of course, three squares a
day are included in the regime. So
deep has he imbedded this idea in
our block of concrete, that we went
hunting after a meal for our complain-
ing paunch again this week and came
up cold but very well-satisfied.

Before trying Marty’s, 936 Diversey
Parkway, (half a block from the El)
prepare with a three-day fast. By
the time the sled-dogs drop you off
at the local icicle and you’re feeling
faint, it’s about time to dig in and
enjoy yourself. The only thing that
could possibly bother you from now
on is a steady flow of food. We have
a pet waiter who keeps insisting that
just one more course will be “good
for your health” despite a pseudo-diet
we use in defense!

Comfortable surroundings in the
Renaissance Room make for a grand
dinner, and impressive paintings keep
your interest until food rolls in. Be
sure to allow plenty of time for a
leisurely dinner, which will include
five courses. If you do this, the Ap-
petizer, Soup, Spaghetti, Main Course
and Dessert will more than please.
Marty’s “Piece de resistance” is a
wonderful steak dinner for about
$1.75. But, if you tire of that, Ital-
ian and American dishes can keep the
most regular customer going for
weeks.

The fine preparation and equally
fine service will send off our most
hardened restaurant-goer a better
man within, and ready for Chicago’s
weather to blow on abound him. The
trip is well worth your while in any
season.

The Jazz Man Record Shop has just
released a new Crescent label, the fin-
est sides yet, in their series of record-
ings of original New Orleans jazzmen.
The band, listed as Kid Ory’s Creole
Jazz Band, is primarily the same one
which has come into national promin-
ence on the Orsen Welles broadcasts:
Mutt Carey, trumpet; Kid Ory, trom-
bone; Omer Simeon, clarinet; Buster
Wilson, piano; Bud Scott, guitar; Ed
Garland, bass; Alton Redd, drums.
They have recorded four sides, South
Creole Song and Blues for Jimmy Get
Out of Here packed with authentic,
rough’-and-ready New Orleans jazz.

Kid Ory is playing the same tailgate
trombone he played twenty years ago
with Louis Armstrong and Joe Oliver,
as in evidence on the strictly Crescent
adaptation of the Benny Moton classic,
South. Those jazz lovers, with a
yearning for the lost aura of old New
Orleans, will also get a special thrill
from his vocal in a NO French dialect
on Creole Song (C’est L’Autre Can-

Mexican Moods
Too Condensed,
Critic laments

Little if anything can be said of
“Mexican Moods,” the first of the
two films shown by the Documentary
Film Group in its initial program of
the Winter Quarter. The film, a tech-
nicolor production by the United
States government, is too condensed
a treatment of Mexico and its people
to be of either educational or enter-
tainment value.

By the first, however, we should
not judge the second. Although the
“Time in the Sun” was not satisfac-
tory as a film, it was more than satis-
factory—indeed, excellent—as picture.
Now there is a difference. Take
almost any good American film, say,
“Laura.” As a whole and only as
a whole was any meaning imparted to
the spectator, and, as one looks back
at the film, a life and vitality is given
individual scenes only as they are
part of and fit in with the remainder
of the film. Not so with “Time in
the Sun.” Quite the reverse. Look-
ing back at it, one is struck not by
the whole, but by particular scenes.
Considering that it consisted of some
four thousand feet of film out of about
two hundred thousand feet shot by
the director, and that it was arranged
by a person other than the director,
it is a tribute to say that it had the
little meaning it did.

As picture, though, faults are sel-
dom if ever present. The director,
Sergei Eisenstein, is considered by
many the world’s most able and fruit-
ful. An artist, he is primarily inter-
ested not in plot or in his actors but
in light and dark, mass and space,
sound and silence. In keeping with
this interest, his actors become al-
most no more than part of the scen-
ery and consequently are given little
if any depth or sympathy or under-
standing. Compensating for this lack
of warmth is the quality of both di-
rection and photography. Faces,
masks, steps of a temple, cacti, detail
in stone, or the sky are, to put it
bluntly, Eisenstein’s ‘meat,’ and it is
in these shots that his particular skill
is evident.

Still, his coldness is evident and
leaves the spectator hoping for more.
The director who achieves the warmth
of “Laura” and the quality of Eisen-
stein is yet to appear. Perhaps Eis-
enstein’s long-awaited and soon-to-
be-issued “Ivan the Terrible” will not
show his present weakness.

B. R. N.

can). Contributing no less to the
warmth and spirit of these sides are
Mutt Carey and Omer Simeon, prob-
ably the best possible choices for such
a group. Simeon’s clarinet stabs bril-
liantly through the knocked out Get
Out of Here which smacks distinctly
of the flavor of the old Buddy Bolden
classic Don't Go Way Nobody with
which tradition has it, Bolden rocked
the Perdido joints around midnight
when the “dicty” folks went home, and
the music got “mean”. Blues for Jim-
my (the late Jimmy Noone) attains
that eloquent richness of emotion of
the true “blues feeling”—no one yet
has been able to play the blues on a
level with a small band of Negro New
Orleans musicians.

These sides are especially recom-
mended to the modern jazz fan yet
unacquainted with that style which
was the daddy of them all; for this
music is easy listening to the rawest
ears, while retaining the true spirit
of the old New Orleans jazz band.

Hildegarde got off to a colorful
start drawing murals on the dining
room wallpaper when she was two.
Later—much later—she graduated to
oils and canvas, and, with her paint-
ing, “Cheyenne Mountain,” won first
place in the oils division of the recent
student art competition held in Good-
speed hall.

Miss Hildegarde Vogel’s only re-
mark made in reference to her prize-
winning painting was, “I am very
much interested in color and color
patterns.” I make no pretense at be-
ing an art critic, but in “Cheyenne
Mountain” I think it is that very color
treatment—suppressed and yet som-
berly exciting—which will impress
you with its blue-ribbon qualities.

With this in mind, I asked Hilde-
garde which of the paintings in the
exhibit she had particularly liked. Ap-
parently the judges have made a valid
choice for Hildegarde’s favorite was
Sonya Katz’s second prize-winner,
“Self Portrait.”

Hildegarde has been studying at the
University for two years and expects
to receive her Ph.B. in June. Teaching
and commercial art don’t particularly
appeal to Hildegarde. But she hopes
—and we do too—that she’ll continue
with her art and that some day soon
we’ll be able to say *We knew her4

Miss Pauline King, first-prize win-
ner in the black-and-white division
with “Virginia Mountaineers” has “al-
ways liked to draw.” She is now
earning the degree of Doctor of Phi-
losophy in the art department of the
University.

After seeing her casually but well
executed sketches of the “Virginia
Mountaineers” and coal miners, I was
interested in her reason for entering
those particular drawings in the com-
petition. This was it:

“I entered the exhibit with these
particular pieces because I felt that
the “American Scene” should be rep-
resented in some way, although I am
not opposed to surrealism and all the
other “isms.” Also, I have always
been interested in the Virginia moun-
taineer and the Virginia coal miner.”

The country which Mexico seeded in
the two Mexican Sessions was an ar-
rid waste when America acquired it
in 1848, inhabited only by lizards,
coyotes, and, above all, insects. The
insect population of the United States
jumped tremendously in that year, as
evidenced by the famous song:

’Tis eighteen hundred and forty-
eight. ...

The year we flies commemorate . . .

The first human inhabitants of the
region were the original settlers of
Utah, the Latter Day Saints, led by
Joseph Smith, Bring ’em Young, Sim-
on Templar, etc. Smith, the founder
of the sect, conceived teh idea in a
divine revelation in the Catskill
Mountains of upper New York State,
a place still filled with revelations,
most of which are far from divine.
Smith found a pair of golden tablets
in the wilderness which he seriously
suspected of being a two-day supply
of B complex vitamin capsules. He
soon discovered that these tablets
were a divine revelation of the history

of the
Mass a‘
Smith’s
ancient

American Indians including
suet, Minnie (Ha Ha!) etc.
followers even adopted the
Indian greeting of “Hi ya,

Watha!” This custom made them ap-
pear somewhat idiotic, causing the
aborigineep of the region to call them
“The Morons.”

The basic precepts of Moronism
were founded on Smith’s discovery

“Menagerie”
Cast Feted
At ODP Tea

“My God, do they pray in here?”
queried Miss Taylor as she settled
herself in a Swift Commons armchair.
Surrounding her on the floor were
Tennessee Williams, author of “The
Glass Menagerie,” Margo Jones, its
co-director, Julie Haydon and Anthony
Ross of the cast, as well as some fifty
University students. The occasion
was a tea given last Tuesday by the
Office of Dramatic Productions for the
people in and around “The Glass Men-
agerie.” Mrs. Kimpton and Mrs.
Kharasch acted as hostesses.

Mr. Williams was the first to arrive,
accompanied by the vibrant Margo
Jones, and Anthony Ross. As soon
as they had all been seated, in came
Julie Haydon, the same Alice in Won-
derland character that all had imag-
ined her. “Julie,” as Miss Taylor
later remarked, “manages to love ev-
erybody. I wish I knew how she
does it.”

Margo Jones delivered a pep talk
to the aspiring Thespians present, on
going out and getting what you want
in the theatre.” The cast of “The In-
spector General” invited the cast of
“The Glass Menagerie” to a special
performance, at which the profession-
als would be the guests of honor. This
plan was partly thwarted, however,
by Laurette Taylor’s announcement,
that, yes, she had seen Stanislavski
do it.

Miss Taylor, who braved the long
trip from downtown in a taxi, proved
the real delight of the afternoon.
When the group had heard one of her
anecdotes for mixed company she
quipped, pointing to a stern gentle-
man on the wall, “Well, he still has
his beard.” Stories about Stanislav-
ski and “Peg O’ My Heart” followed,
but were cut short by the arrival of
another taxi, called to whisk the
guests back to the loop. The tea was
immensely successful: it was infor-
mal, fascinating, and grand.

that the golden tablets were legible
only to people who wore a special
pair of reading glasses he had dis-
covered at the side of the tablets. As
these glasses were imposible of du-
plication, the only way in which
Smith’s followers could behold divine
revelations was by putting themselves
in the mood of a pair of glasses. The
New Yorkers thought that the Mor-
ons were thereby making spectacles
of themselves and began to drop such
gentle hints as tarring and feathering
some of the bretheren, etc.

Because it is well known that no
form of clothing is so conducive to
traveling as tar and feathers, the stu-
dent will easily understand why the
Morons moved to Illinois. Their first
settlement was Kaskaskia by the Mis-
sissippi. Because only 2 7/8% of the
Morons could spell both Kaskaskia
and Missisippi, they moved to Salt
Lake City. Settling at Salt Lake City
was quite difficult because it wasn’t
there at the time. Bring ’em Young,
most F.N.E. in A.H. of the Morons,
was quite disappointed in the site of
Salt Lake City. In fact, his first
words were “THIS is the place?” The
bretheren wished that they could just
forget about the place and fly away.
They therefore built a statue of a
seagul, about which a large part of
the civic life of the settlement re-
volved until the building of the Saltair
Beach pavilion, sometimes known as
the Moron Tabernacle.

Of serious American composers
Howard Hanson is the most well-
represented on records. At one time
or another his Symphony No. 2 “Ro-
mantic”, & suite drawn from the opera
Merry Mount, and his large work for
chorus and orchestra, The Lament For
Beowulf, have been available. Merry
Mount, which was the most readily
accessible of these ind easily the most
popular, suffered that fate inexplicable
which befalls so many many nice al-
bums and leaves so much trash avail-
able—it was withdrawn.

Now the first symphony has been
added to the list of Hanson works
recorded. Hanson won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1944 for his Symphony No. 4.
Since this happened while the record-
ing ban was still on, it is presumed
that, otherwise, we should have had a
recording of that much better, more
mature work. Certainly, as a first
symphony, this one is pretty much of
a flop. Many an unwary listener
must have been surprised to hear the
descending scale which opens the last

movement of
Symphony in
movements of
cyclical works

Tschaikowsky’s Fifth
the second and third
the work. Like most
it goes in circles and

never really gets any place. It may
be that contemporary composers in-
dulge in the cyclical form so frequently
because they fear that, otherwise,
their works will lack unity. To be
sure, Haydn, who never was accused
of a lack of unity, succeeds in intro-
ducing the most diverse material into
a work (as, for example, the Quartet
in E Flat, Op. 33, No. 2); yet Haydn
always “comes out even” in the end.

It remains to remark that the sym-
phony had its first performance by the
Boston Symphony on April 5, 1929
(not 1928, as the accompanyihg notes

say).

help stinking in spite of itself. Deanna
Durbin—lovely in technicolor—flounc-
es through it to the bitter end with
a song on her lips and one gorgeous
gown after another on her back.
“Can’t help singing,” she carols at too
frequent intervals. Her inability to
control her laryngeal vibrations is
unnecessarily painful, since the music
in the picture in toto is inane and
uninteresting. It flows from the lips
of wagon trainers, and in a possibly
genuine baritone from Robert Paige,
a definitely dull young man who plays
opposite Miss Durbin. The fault is
not hers, Paige’s, or even the wagon
trainers, I suspect/but may be laid
at the feet of the sub-idiot who wrote
the script.

The plot is one of those easy ones
which can be summarized in a flash.
(Deanna leaves her home in the east
to marry a paternally-unapproved cav-
alry officer in the west; she falls in
love with somebody she meets on
the way instead; finis with fiesta
flourish.) The unhappiness of the final
effect is not to be blamed on the
simplicity of the story, but on the
stupidity of handling. Its authors try
desperately to keep us diverted from
the main issues. We are sidetracked
for what seems like hours on a pic-
turesque hill-side alone with Deanna,
who is trilling angelically and com-
muning with Nature suggestive of a
rebirth of Transcendentalism.

By far the most interesting diver-
sion in the picture is a couple of
nomadic characters, Akim Tamiroff
and Leonid Kinskey, who alternate
between being Dickensian and the
Duke and Dauphin of Huckleberry
Finn. They serve no visible func-
tion by their presence, but one is glad
of it anyway. This same absence of

Religious Activities

To open their winter program, the
Calvert Club will present the Rever-
end Alfonso Castiello, S.J., visiting
Latin-American professor, at their
weekly meeting next Sunday evening
at 8:00. Father Castiello, a Jesuit,
who studied in England and now
teaches in Mexico City, will talk on
“Latin America’s Cultural Heritage.”

Speaking at the club’s home at 5735
University, Fr. Castiello will bring
out the views of Mexico, ideas new
and fresh to those accustomed to
thinking in terms of accepted Ameri-
can cultural values. Because of his
studies in England, completed in
Spain and France, he speaks excellent
English and understands the Old
World in contrast to the New.

Through the cooperation of the
U.S. Dept, of State Fr. Castiello is
teaching at Loyola University this
quarter. In Mexico he is dean of the
faculty of philosophy and literature
of the Centro Cultural Universitario
of Mexico City, an affiliate of the Na-
tional University of Mexico.

At last Sunday’s meeting general
plans for the quarter were made. The
Sunday night open house will continue
with prominent speakers on the pro-
gram. The social calendar will in-
clude a Mardi Gras Dance, a St. Pat-
rick’s Day party, and the quarterly
CVlderley weekend at the club’s es-
tate near Wheeling, Illinois.

“The National Student Consultation
held from December 27 to 30 in Gran-

student pastor and representative of
the University of Chicago and the
Congregational Church at the con-
ference.

“It was,” said Mr. Vorba, “The first
meeting of its kind in Protestant his-
tory, for it is the first conference
which plans to go beyond the confer-
ence stage and really form a central
organization.”

Dr. Henry Simon Bloch, speaking
about “Social Conflict and Individual
Responsibility,” will be guest speaker
at the first Hillel Fireside of the Win-

Student Forum
Addressed on
Race Relations

John Brenton, a Relocation Officer
of the War Relocation Authority, gave
an interesting talk before the Student
Forum last Tuesday, January 10. The
topic under discussion was “New De-
velopments in Race Relations.”

Mr. Brenton, in discussing this top-
ic, used the presence of American
born Japanese and the friction exist-
ing between them and native Ameri-
cans as an example for his thesis. He
then went on to state how relocation,
the best way to help solve this par-
ticular problem, depended largely on
the people themselves. Housing, em-
ployment, and public acceptance form
the main constituents of relocation,
according to Mr. Benton, and public
cooperation is necessary for these.
Dismissing critics, he pointed out that
a fear complex was largely responsi-
ble for much of the friction. In Cali-
fornia public opinion is undergoing a
change as the fear complex is lessen-
ing. The facts, he concluded, speak
for themselves, and it is up to the
people of this country to throw off
their fear complex.

Recording concerts and teas, spon-
sored by the Ida Noyes Council will

Chicago’s last defeat at the hands
of Navy Radio wasn’t as lopsided as
the score (59-47) might show. The
decisions were lousy and both teams
had plenty of gripes coming. This
same type of officiating hampered the
recent Stagg tournament no end and
while some have held that the referees
had to keep the games in hand, we
thought that fouls and traveling were
called entirely too closely.

If the U. of C. had had one man
who was about 6’4” or thereabouts
and could play with an average degree
of proficiency, we think that the Mar-
oons would have been a hard team to
beat by any man’s team. At least we
could have taken Northwestern.

Stampf Five Beats
Favored Harvard
In Upset, 33-28

By Bob Schallman

Playing before an overflowing
crowd on last Tuesday, the U-High
heavy basketball team defeated Har-
vard School for Boys in Bartlett Gym-
nasium. It was indeed a grand mo-
ment for Coach Joe Stampf and his
boys when the final gun sounded and
the scoreboard read: U-High 33, Har-
vard 28, for it was the first time in
eight years that the first and second
year college boys had defeated their
arch rivals.

The game was a thrilling spectacle
throughout. Although Stampf’s
starting five of Schallman, Heffron,
Gray, Hansen and Blumberg were at
a decided disadvantage due to the
greater height of Harvard’s players,
Uncle Joe’s boys got their share of
rebounds and the half found them
trailing by a narrow margin, 12 to
10.

In the second half, however, Schall-
man and Gray found the range of the
hoop, Hansen’s fine defensive play be-
gan to take effect and after a nip and
tuck third quarter Chicago led 20 to
19. In an exciting final period which
had the crowd constantly on its feet,
Chicago pulled ahead and as the final
gun sounded the boys in Maroon were

ahead 33 to 28.

Maroons Lose Last
Fieldhouse Game
To Chicago Radio

With a score of 59 to 47, Bernie
Beiderman and the Chicago Navy Ra-
dio School handed the Maroons their
sixth defeat in twelve starts last
Saturday at the Fieldhouse. The ser-
vice team had knocked off Chicago
by a one point margin before the hol-
idays. Beiderman, a small, fast
guard, dropped in 5 baskets and 7
free throws for game honors, while
Fred DeGraw maintained his high
scoring for the second consecutive
game with 15 points.

George Raby, Maroon center, was
fouled five times and dropped in 4
free throws to add to his 5 field bas-
kets for additional scoring honors.
The Radio team led all the way with
the help of Bob Robbins and George
Janchenko who dropped in 5 and 1
apiece.

The University tied the score once
at 20 up right before the half, but
Chicago Radio closed the intermission
period with a 7 point lead. The Ma-
roons were never able to overcome^
this lead and gradually fell behind to

be defeated by 12 points.

The Chicago Maroons, sport-
ing their best record in six long
seasons, wrapped their home
schedule in camphor this week
and moved through rehearsals in
anticipation of the two wind-up
contests.

Their season, cut short by the
shift of naval trainees schedule,
to take place after Jan. 20, the
Maroon cagemen will shut down
after a game, Monday, with
Wheaton College and a joust,
Jan. 20, at George Williams Col-
lege.

Chicago has pieced together six vic-
tories to match the six setbacks they
have incurred. And the record books
reveal that though this year’s club
is not engaged in Big Ten conference
play, that is the best posted by a
Chicago quintet since the club went
into a tailspin dropping 46 consecutive
contests.

If the Maroons split the final en-
gagements they will come up with a
.500 record. If they score a grand
slam they’ll end up in the black.

Chicago flattened both teams in pre-
vious encounters. Wheaton College
was hammered 41-33 while George
Williams was spanked 39-30. But
both games were played amid the
familiar confines of the Fieldhouse and
sports professors generally acknow-
ledge that the home floor is good for
at least 6 points.
