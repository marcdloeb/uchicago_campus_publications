Women Fear Dormitory Council

Editorial

Democracy, Anarchy Or What?

It grieves us greatly to take issue with Miss
Slade, a contributor to this week’s “Letters to
the Editor” column, and to several of the girls
who attended Wednesday’s meeting of the wom-
en’s dormitories. However, the principles at
stake are infinitely more important than the
feelings of a few people who either refuse to or
are incapable of understanding the very basis
of good democratic government.

There are two major charges which can be
levelled against Miss Slade and her fellow travel-
lers. These people, who smugly deny the need
of inter-dormitory government and who are the
first to gripe bitterly about unsatisfactory con-
ditions or regulations such as the girls’ hours,
are guilty of the worst kind of complacency. On
the other hand, if they deny being complacently
satisfied with the status quo as their complaints
would indicate, they demonstrate an amazing
and complete shortsightedness in their failure

to identify common welfare with their individual
welfare and their refusal to accept the respon-
sibilities of self-government. What other explan-
ation can be offered for a decision to refrain from
participating in group action for group better-
ment?

At one point during Wednesday’s meeting,
criticism was presented against the idea of offer-
ing commuters associate memberships in the
various dormitories. The typical comment was
that the one thousand commuters would crowd
dormitory residents right out of the houses.
Aside from the fact that this charge is obviously
ridiculous, it does demonstrate total lack of un-
derstanding of the Maroon's proposal.

The program contained in last week’s edit-
orial was merely our modest suggestion for pos-
sible areas of investigation and courses of action
for the inter-dormitory council. The attempt to
make the council principle rise or fall on the

Debate Meet
At U.C. Set
For March 2

“How Shall We Deal with Germany
After the War?” has been chosen as
the topic for the all-Quadrangle dis-
cussion conference to be sponsored
Friday, March 2, by the Student For-
um. In his announcement, Dale M.
Stucky, director of the sponsoring
group, emphasized that participation
in the conference is not limited to
members of the Forum, but that all
men and women in the University are
urged to attend.

In addition to giving students an
opportunity to exchange ideas and
opinions on a problem of national con-
cern, the conference will give observ-
ing judges chance to choose from
among the participants a group of
students to represent the University
and the Student Forum in the West-
ern Conference Debating League dis-
cussion conference. This “Big Ten”
meet will be held at Northwestern
University March 8 and 9, and the
same topic will be discussed.

Preliminary plans for the confer-
ence on campus include a schedule of
speakers to appear in the intervening
time at the weekly Student Forum
meetings. The programs will be de-
signed to give students a background
of thought for the conference.

Any student who is qualified scho-
lastically for participation in inter-
collegiate athletics will be eligible to
represent the University at the dis-
cussion and debate tournament to be
held at Northwestern. The require-

Annual to be
Published By
Maroon Staff

“Souvenir,” an annual magazine for
the College of the University, will be
published for the first time on May 15,
according to plans announced this
week by The Chicago Maroon, which
is sponsoring the venture. “Souvenir”
represents an innovation in campus
publications, since all four years of
the College have never before been
represented in such a yearbook .

The magazine will rely heavily on
photography to review the year’s
events and personalities in the life
of the College, and will include essays
describing and interpreting the Col-
lege curriculum plan and the College
residence program from a student
point of view. It will have typical
magazine-size format, and will con-
tain fifty-six to sixty-four pages, print-
ed on “slick paper”, and a heavy cover,
although not the padded cover used
for such traditional yearbooks as “Cap
and Gown,” the University annual
now a wartime casualty.

Managing editor for “Souvenir”
will be Lorraine MacFadden, and her
staff will be drawn from all four
years of the College. Departmental
Editors announced are: Helen Tar-
low, Administration; Kathleen Over-
holser, Dormitories; Espey Voulis,
Music, Art, Dramatics, and Publca-
tions; Samuel Davies and Jack Hill,
Athletics; Virginia Mainzer, Social
Activities; Abe Krash, Curriculum;
Tom Rogers, Religious and Service
Groups; Mitchell Cotter and Bob Del-
gado, Photography; David Brill and
Alan Strauss, Business.

IF Sees Need
For Proposal

Latest development in the growing
movement for over-all student self-
government at the University was the
endorsement of the principle by the
Interfraternity Council in its meeting
Wednesday afternoon.

The text of the resolution adopted
by members of the Council, who rep-
resent all fraternities now active on
campus, is as follows: “The Inter-
fraternity Council hereby recognizes
the need for student government on
this campus and hereby endorses the
effort being made by certain organ-
izations and hereby assures the co-
operation of the entire fraternity sys-
tem.” The resolution represents the
first formal approval of the self-gov-
ernment proposals made by any of
the major active campus organizations.

Another group actively campaigning
for the principle, the committee formed
especially for this purpose by Charles
Schwartz, Lenore Callahan, and Joan
Beckman, has issued a call for more
members to join them in their drive
for making students aware of the
advantages of some form of repre-
sentative government. At its last
meeting, held Tuesday, the group, now
including Ann Duvendack, Jim Hal-
vorsen, and Alan Strauss, appointed
Joan Beckman secretary. Those in-
terested in joining the committee, and
those who want to offer their views
on the subject, pro and con, are re-
quested to submit their names to Miss
Beckman. Plans for regular weekly
meetings of the committee, to be held
every Tuesday in Ida Noyes Hall at
7 p.m. have also been made, and
invitations to attend will soon be
extended to those indicating desires
to present their views to the group.

Mayer, Munnecke To Debate
Peacetime Military Service

Post-war military conscription, a question that has aroused
increasing interest and discussion, is the subject of two meetings
planned for the near future by Labor Rights Society and the

Socialist Club.

Milton Mayer, publicist, and
Wilbur C. Munnecke, vice-presi-
dent of the University, will pre-
sent the case for and against
conscription at the Labor Rights
meeting next Friday evening at
8:00 in the Oriental Institute.
Mortimer J. Adler will act as
moderator. Everyone is invited.
Labor Rights has not as yet
adopted an official position on the
subject, but plan to do so at a
meeting on January 30.

The Socialist Club, which takes an
unequivocal stand against peacetime
conscription, will discuss the topic at
an open meeting on Monday at 7:15
p.m. in Social Science 105. Speakers

HIT BACK AT

INTEGRATING
DORMITORIES

Fear of an over-all dormitory
council “which would tell us what
to do about hours” was expressed
by women dormitory residents
Wednesday evening at a meeting
sponsored by Gates Hall for dis-
cussion of an organization which
would integrate all University
residence halls under one com-
prehensive program. Agreeing,
however, that social integration
would be desirable, a plan was
recommended for the establish-
ment of an advisory body, com-
posed of two representatives
from each of the women’s dor-
mitories, without men’s repre-
sentation, to study problems af-
fecting women residents. The
plan is to be submitted to the
members of each of the six dor-
mitories for vote, and any dor-
mitory approving it may send its
representatives to the group.

Among those attending the meeting
were the presidents of each of the
women’s dormitories, including Ann
Kronquist, Beecher; Bee Everson,
Blake; Mary Alice Sproull, Foster;
Emma Lou Orth, Gates; Jean Gate-
wood, Green; and Florence Allen, Kel-
ly. Chief opposition to a council with
real power to take steps for solution
of common dormitory problems, men’s
as well as women’s, which would be
binding upon individual dormitories,
came from Foster, Kelly, Green, and
Beecher Halls, with support of such
an effective organization coming from
the representatives of Gates and
Blake.

Letters to the Editor

Pro’s and Con’s on Council Plan;

Letters Swarm to Editor; Campus
Opinion Divided on Major Issues
To the Editor:

The great movement which you report is “soaring skyward”
with the help of a “cherry-hot searchlight”, seems to me to be a
regrettable expenditure of energy channeled into rather juvenile
lines. You also state that the “why dormitory council” time is
past, but really gentlemen, it is hard to agree with you.

Close scrutiny of the Maroon and
numerous “believers” has not provided
one good reason for the necessity of
establishing a Student Council. Per-
haps Mr. Gottesman’s college life is
uncertain and confused (his very
words), but I suspect a short holiday
from Maroon-editing would do won-
ders in clearing up this condition.
Much more, at any rate, than would
a Student Council, whose functions
proposed by you strike me as much
ado about nothing and in the wrong
direction at that.

That a Student Council is necessary
to evaluate the experimental housing
program for the first two years, and
finding it successful, extend it to the
last two years, smacks faintly of the
cart before the horse motif. Do you
not think it might be better to view
the results of the experiment with
an eye on the relative value of ini-
tiating a Council?

And as for your assertion that a
Council would be a substantial help in
including commuters in extra-curric-
ular programs, gentlemen, you dream.
As many functions as possible are
planned in consideration of commut-
ers, that is, they are given in the
afternoon; a Council providing asso-
ciate membership in the various dor-
mitories can hardly provide a place
to spend the night. As a means of
reaching each individual student (the
existing means are admittedly re-
grettably deficient at times), associ-
ate membership in the houses presents
itself as an extraordinarily complex,
if even possible, way of going about
it.

Aside from being wholeheartedly
opposed to hour regulations in the
last two years (and as much to the
contrary for the first two years), the
idea of a Student Council “proposing,
executing and enforcing” such a pol-
icy, forces out of me what is known
as the horse-laugh. We have existed
a long time without specific supervis-
ion and with great success. If times
and circumstances have changed we
will change with them and we should
do so on our own as rational individ-
uals. I for one, would feel no more
qualified to enforce a policy of this
type on others than I would feel
pleased to have them enforce it on
me. So let us leave the Constitutions
of other Universities, perused by Mr.
Gottesman, to the other Universities.

The Maroon, by courteous and mod-
erately artful manipulation of the
subject, has endeared this scheme to
a group of people. But the fact that
it is being backed at all is no recom-
mendation, to my mind at least. Billy
Sunday had quite a following too. I
will take the liberty to predict that
any such organization as a Student
Council will either 1) offer us some
mildly revolting politics, or 2) be so
loose as to be entirely without effect,
or 3) achieve that pityable state in
which it yips around, clasps its hands
and accomplishes nothing.

May I suggest that in the future it
might be more worthwhile to make
an all-out effort for a Union Building,
than indulge in huff and puff about
propositions as blind-mouthed, im-

practical and unnecessary as student
government for the University of
Chicago.

Sincerely,
Sylvia Slade

Denounces Plan Opponents

To the Editor:

Gates Hall was the scene of a meet-
ing of the house councils of the six
women’s residence halls Wednesday.
At least that is what they called it.
These people, elected by supposedly
sound-minded students who were chos-
en because of their administrative
ability and good sense, were assem-
bled with the announced intent of dis-
cussing a dormitory council.

The logical and only place to begin
such a discussion, it seems to me,
would be with consideration of the
question: “What would be the func-
tion of an interdormitory council?”
The obvious answer to this question is
that it would deal with problems of
concern to the student body, who
would benefit if these problems were
resolved. I say that this is obvious
since it is the very reason suggested
by the Maroon when it instigated the
inter-dorm council movement.

The question which follows from
this discussion is: “Do such problems
exist? What is their nature?” The
person who will not concede that cer-
tain circumstances exist on campus
which prevent maximum student ben-
efit is too self-satisfied to be at this
meeting, and is hardly worth consider-
ing. Nevertheless, since there were
such people present at the Gates meet-
ing, their viewpoint must be examined.
There were certain individuals pres-
ent who saw no room for improvement.
All that I can say to them is that
I am glad for them and hope there
are no more at home like them.

The more rational members of the
discussion would undoubtedly be will-
ing to admit that there exists a prob-
lem concerning the place of the com-
muter in the college outside the cur-
riculum. They would be quick to ad-
mit that the lack of integration and
association between members of vari-
ous dorms on campus, between levels
of the college, and between commut-
ers and residents, poses a problem.

It doesn’t take too much thought
to decide that the conditions which
give rise to such problems are unde-
sirable, and that undesirable condi-
tions ought to be removed.

The next consideration would be,
“Is a dormitory council capable of
solving such problems?” The only
answer I can suggest is: Try it and

find out.

It would then be necessary to de-
cide upon the form that this council
would take. And lastly, but most im-
portant to the success of the commit-
tee, would be endowing it with the
necessary powers to achieve its pur-
pose.

To justify my dissatisfaction with
Wednesday’s meeting, may I say that
this was hardly the procedure follow-
ed by it. Each dorm group seemed
primarily interested in impressing the
other five with the ease with which it
functioned in comparison with some
unnamed but identifiable hall. Nat-
urally this resulted in a half hour of
that invigorating sport, verbal hair
pulling.

One of the speakers accused the
people sitting across the room from
her of not knowing what was going
on. Several arched backs resulted.
It is hard to tell if the accuser was
also guilty of the offense, but all evi-
dence seems to point in that direction.

Instead of indulging in a semi-ra-
tional discussion of the nature of the
problems needing to be solved, and
deciding upon a mechanism to do the
work, they immediately set about pro-
posing and rejecting solutions. By
this time it seemed that the hair pull-
ing would not be restricted to the
realm of the verbal.

After the girls had their exercise,
one of the less athletic members of
the group suggested that they get
back to the business of an inter-dor-
mitory council. They finally decided
to organize a council composed of one
or two members from each dorm which
will meet regularly. It is to be of a
purely advisory nature, but whom it
is to advise in regard to what, still
remain mysteries.

Incredible as it appears, the sour
grapes found above are actually an
attempt to be constructive. Despite
the fact that occurrences at this meet-
ing are highly discouraging, it is nec-
essary to bear in mind that the inter-
dormitory council has a place and is
needed on this campus. The people
elected by your readers will deter-
mine the success or failure of the
council, who, in turn, will be called
upon to deal with some of the im-
portant problems besetting us.

Sincerely,
Dolores Engel

Council Needed, She Says

To the Editor:

It is certainly gratifying to see the
Maroon sponsor the cause of Student
Government. Many of us have felt
for some time that such an organiza-
tion would be a tremendous boost to
the activities on the Campus.

At the present time, there is really
no lack of activities, but they are un-
cooperative and many of them un-

the result that such a disorganized

Since you are in a position to act,
could I suggest that you call a con-
ference of the heads of the larger or-
ganizations. Chapel Union, Y.W.C.A.,
Inter-club Council, Inter-fraternity
Council, O.D.P., Social Committee,
Publicity Committee, War Activities
Committee, Women’s Federation, Ida
Noyes Council, and of course our Ma-
roon should be represented.

Such a council should take over the
planning of the year’s activities cal-
endar, could facilitate publicity for
their various club functions, and, in
general, provide a medium of cam-
pus unity and cooperation through
which the Student Body could act and
make itself heard.

Delta Sigma Will
Back “Craig’s Wife”

Delta Sigma will sponsor a benefit
performance of Craig's Wife at the
Goodman Theatre, Saturday evening,
January 27, for the club’s Scholarship
Fund. The play, a Pulitzer Prize
comedy by George Kelly, is a favorite
in the Goodman repertoire. Active
and alumnae Delta Sigmas are co-
operating to promote the benefit and
out-of-town alumnae, some of them in
service, are buying tickets to be used
by serviceman.

The Fund, started in 1926, is a
revolving loan fund administered by
the University, for deserving under-
graduates other than Delta Sigmas,
The Bursar reports that the loans
are usually paid. The Fund now
amounts to $1267, and it is expected
that several hundred dollars will be
added by this benefit performance,
which will swell the Fund for increas-
ing post-war demands. '

Tickets, at one dollar including tax,
are available from any Delta Sigma
or at the University Information Of-
fice.

Thurman Talks
At Negro Club

Howard Thurman, nationally known
lecturer and former Dean of the Chap-
el at Howard University in Washing-
ton, D.C., spoke to an informal gather-
ing of members from the Negro Stu-
dent Club Sunday night, January 14.
Dean Thurman, at present is associate
pastor of an inter-racial church in
San Francisco and addressed the
group between trains en route to ful-
fill speaking engagements in the East.
He described the work of the inter-
racial church as an attempt to relieve
racial tension through cooperation
within one of the cultural units. The
club members were told that “until
society has progressed far enough so
that the individual feels safe from
various indignities and persecutions,
he will cling to the groupings, how-
ever small, that give him personna.”
Dean Thurman indicated that it is
the group loyalties which cause fric-
tion when they clash.

In answer to a question concerning
the role of the American Negro now
and after the war, Dean Thurman
said that Western civilization has lost
its characteristic quality of respect
that made American democracy safe
for the dignity of man. This it was
for minorities. It is the duty of
American minorities to bring to the
attention of the governing body its
disease so that it can be cured.

Dean Thurman concluded his visit
with the reading of several poems
among them selections from his re-
cently published collection.

• THE CHICAGO MAROON -
Public Invited
To Open House,
Gates Canteen

Gates Hall celebrated the opening
of their Canteen last Tuesday night,
from 10:30 to 11:30 o’clock, by drink-
ing the coffee made by Emmy Lou
Orth, chewing gum, and eating candy
... all of which was offered for sale.
Besides the inhabitants of Gates, sev-
eral girls from Blake Hall, and their
dates, attended the opening of the
Canteen. It is hoped that the pub-
lic will accept the cordial invitation
of Gates Hall to come to their Can-
teen which will be open every night,
except Saturday, from 10:30 to 11:30
o’clock.
♦

The Canteen which is located in
the basement of Gates Hall was
planned, not only to provide a gather- I
ing place for a light snack, but also
to obtain money to finance other Gates
Hall activities. The girls of Gates are
volunteering their services each night
in the Canteen which, if profitable,
will be able to expand.

The dorm will hold its first open
house of this quarter on Sunday after-
noon from 3:00 to 6:00 o’clock. Every-
one is cordially invited to attend. Re-
freshments will be served, and all
rooms are open to the public.

Two open houses were held at Gates
last quarter and it is hoped that the
response to this one will be as suc-
cessful.

And So to Press

That age old, threadbare canard
about “doing the impossible at once
with the miraculous taking a bit long-
er” has been dusted off on the Quad-
rangles and while the plan is still very
much in the embryo stage, it is no
longer in the realm of a military se-
cret to report with some degree of
assurance that the University of Chi-
cago will blossom forth with a cam-
pus radio station in the very near fu-
ture.

If you are among the skeptics who
have already dismissed the grapevine
chit-chat of such a plan with a horse
laugh on the grounds that student
progress and innovations are impos-
sible on the campus, there is a very
sudden, and somewhat pleasant awak-
ening in store for you. A very mod-
est and unassuming young gentleman,
William Washington by name, a math-
ematical wizard, will set the tempor-
arily derailed back on the tracks. Mr.
Washington, a student in the third
year of the college with a mathemati-
cal I.Q. that plays hob with the strato-
sphere, has been the guiding spirit of
the technological side of the plan, and
will, if you gently push him, carefully
and most meticulously explain it all
to you. In all candor, it must be con-
fessed that the plan is not original—
Harvard, Dartmouth, and Amherst
have similar setups. Nevertheless,

From 3-5:30 p.m. Sunday, the social
committees of Foster and Kelly Halls
under the leadership of social chair-
men Anna Nichols and Jean Cranston,
are giving a tea to which faculty
members of the first two years of the
College and several of the Deans
have been invited. The wives of Deans
Kimpton, Phelps, Davey, MacLean,
Faust, and Frodin have been asked
to officiate at the tea.

radiators or a heating system can
pipe a voice if the proper transmitter
connections are made. You can, if
you are within 300 feet of any
part of the University, pick up
the program on its designated fre-
quency over your set. If the gears
whirr in your noggin as they do that
of Bill Washington’s, you will care-
fully explain to the uninitiated that it
works something like this: The voice is
changed into an electrical audio-fre-
quency, poured into an ECO transmit-
ter, and because of electro magnetic
induction frequency, oscillations are
established in the radiator.

There are, of course, a myriad of
details besieging the ambitious pro-
ponents. Other University radio sta-
tions are blessed with a goodly num-
ber of shekels to jingle in their jeans,
a huge outlay of equipment, a sympa-
thetic and supporting administration,
and, what is even more important,
highly trained and skilled folk who
know all the ins-and-outs of radio.

The vistas which have been opened
by the plan are tremendous. Aside
from the possibilities of receiving lec-
tures in bed or the president’s pro-
nunciamentos directly, the radio will
serve as a medium of expression for
student thought, an excellent coordina-
tor of university activities.

What is needed, at the moment is
trained and competent management.
Once the plan is advanced beyond the
blueprint stage, it will undoubtedly
attract more of that calibre of direc-
tion.

And even tho you may still be a

(Continued from page one)

single question of what to do with the commuter problem is a
shabby device for dodging the real issue. Let us remind the
campus that the policies and actions of the council will be made
by those people who are elected to the council by dormitory mem-
bers, and NOT by the Chicago Maroon. But this subversion is
typical.

As for Miss Slade’s suggestion that we concern ourselves
with the advocacy of a student union building, rather than the
principles of inter-dormitory government, we remind her that such
a proposal was discussed at length in these columns last summer.
However, we wish to point out that action in behalf of a union
building would also be a logical function of a council, though NOT
a substitute for that council.

We seriously wonder whether the girls who set themselves
so squarely against the establishment of an inter-dormitory council
fully appreciate or understand the implications which must be
drawn from their actions. By their over-concern for their narrow
prerogatives and their refusal to participate in collective action for
communal good, they are, in effect, demanding anarchy in place
of democracy. To say “to hell with government, to hell with the
next fellow; I have liberties and I’ll do as I damned please” IS
anarchy.

Furthermore, where is the foundation in fact for the prevalent
idea that a council representative of all dormitories will be prone
to tax students with regulations any more repressive than those
promulgated by individual house officers ? Why do these students
feel that they cannot entrust their elected representatives with
powers sufficient for effective action? And is the province of an
inter-dormitory council to be limited only to the invention of more
stringent regulations? Are there no more problems on campus
affecting student life which might be resolved by group action?

A large-scale dormitory building program will be initiated
by the University in the near future; a comprehensive and inclu-
sive extra-curricular program is being planned. Is there any
logical reason why a responsible, representative and capable stu-
dent council shouldn’t materially assist in the development of
plans for action which will so definitely affect every student in
his life at the University ? To Miss Slade and some of her friends
in Beecher and Green: this is more than an opportunity to eliminate
some of your pet gripes; it is a responsibility you must accept.

P.S. Mr. Hutchins and members of the faculty (especially
instructors of Social Sciences 2 and 3) please note:

Of what value has the University’s liberal arts program
been to such people who are supposed to be “better citizens” as
a result of their studies here? We humbly suggest that students
be taught to UNDERSTAND “The Federalist” rather than merely
to read it.

Darrieux Stars
In First Of
Film Series

The first of the fiction films shown
this quarter, “Abused Confidence,”
with Danielle Darrieux, has qualities
unlike most of the foreign films pre-
sented in this series. The winner of a
Grand Prix in Paris, it is, nevertheless,
reminiscent of more than a few Amer-
ican pictures.

Lydia, a Parisian law student, has
lost the means of continuing her edu-
cation. Unable to find work and in
considerable debt she is shown by a
friend the possibility of acting the
part of a wealthy professor’s long
lost illegitimate daughter. Doing so,
she brings happiness to that gentle-
man who, apparently, has not had any
children by a later marriage. The pro-
fessor’s wife learns the truth about
Lydia from Lydia’s old acquaintances,
but is so impressed during a dramatic
courtroom scene in which Lydia de-
fends her first client whose crime has
been much the same as her own, that
she decides not to disclose the truth
to her husband and break his heart.
Lydia, ashamed of her conduct, is
about to run away when the profes-
sor’s wife intercedes and has her re-
main. All’s well that ends well, but
being an extremely moral character,
I hoped it would end much differently.
The truth should have been revealed
to the professor. I realize of course
that this is a hypothetical situation,
and, as such, the effect upon the lead-
ing characters can never well be
known. I do think, however, that a
little insight into the possibility of
another outcome might lead the spec-
tator to a more satisfactory appraisal
of the film.	B. R. N.

Around

The Town

Otto dug out his compass and we
stumbled back to civilization just in
time for a movie and a late snack.
We never did decide whether it was
because Otto’s doctor told him he has
a tape-worm, or because your “o’bejnt
svnt” needed more copy, but, at any
rate, we stepped into “Isbell’s” at
1435 E. Hyde Park Blvd., for eats
before heading back to the Campus.
Midst the Red Plush and Atmosphere,
Love came to Otto.

While going over one of those amaz-
ingly colorful publications Isbell uses
for menus, Otto glanced up to meet
the eyes of one of the most beautiful
lady tape-worms he had ever seen.
Not being much of a judge of Tape-
worm on the Hoof, we continued to
take notes about the plush-lined ginny.

We discovered that, not only does
the food match pictures on the fully
illustrated “Encyclopaedia-Britanni-
ca-a-la-Isbell,” but that, if you draw
one of the better waitresses, it tastes
wonderful. We can always blame a
little poor service on the War, but
nothing but a darned good cook can
turn out meals like that.

If you guys want to impress Her
for dinner or an after-town bite, keep
Isbell’s not too far up the sleeve. The
dining room is beautifully decorated
and prices match the usual allowance,
being exactly alike in either of the
two rooms.

Otto was pining away on creamed-
chicken-en-casserole and a chef’s sol-
ad when we noticed him again. Before
they left, he had learned that her
name is Olga, and that she belongs to
some scoundrel who runs a competi-
tive column in the Phi Gam pub-
lication. But he loves her, so we real-
ly hope that he sees her again some-
where in our travels Around the
Town.	—B.C.

The Hungry Teachers

Foster to join them. It seems the hardier girls showed up and the fellows,
slightly awed by the belles’ physical prowess, had to call a truce after which
they adjourned to the Foster parlor where more entertainment (of a much
milder nature) followed.

Signs of the Times

When the cigarette license for Ida Noyes Hall was issued, the Bureau
of Internal Revenue was somewhat skeptical of the quantity of cigarettes
being sold and made out the license for Ida No-Yes Hall. Basketball practice
for the prospective girls’ tournament is producing a large number of brok-
en glasses, charley horses, and splinters (hardier souls from Kentucky who
don’t own gym shoes have been playing in their bare feet)...It’s getting so
that you can recognize a basketball player from the way she eases herself
into chairs and carefully descends steps.

Odds and Ends

Stan Kovacs tossed an open house last Saturday for Mike Clarke and
Paul Krietenstein who are leaving for the army... Biggest boner of the week
was committed by Phil Day, who printed on the cards, announcing the Wednes-
day luncheon of the Baptists, the novel preview that Dean Gilkey will squeak
on “The Distinctive Baptist Witness.” Tau Sigs are having a dance Satur-
day at the Windermere. After the USO dance last Saturday at which some
of the University girls entertained, the enchanted sailors have proposed to
set up a date bureau. Don Senhauser has left us for the services and 17
year old Jack McCarthy is slated to leave soon, too.

The ambulatory patients at Gardiner General Hospital will be entertained
on Valentine’s Day by a musical comedy sponsored by the Campus Red
Cross unit. The date was also desired by Northwestern University, but,
alas, the latter was politely (?) refused.

Jayni Cowen, who is producing the show, is sending out a call for
singers, dancers and people who would like to work on the costumes.

After the show, there will be dancing and refreshments. The music
will be provided by a Gardniner Hospital band.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Hans Lange Conducts Concert

Judy Downs

Servin' It Hot

Commemoration
Work, Soprano
Top Program

Hans Lange opened last Friday’s
Chamber Concert with Bach’s Con-
certo in F for harpsichord, two flutes,
and strings, with Dorothy Lane at the
harpsichord, Harvey Noack and Emil
Eck, flutists, and a chamber orchestra
drawn from the Chicago Symphony.
The soloists played their parts with
distinction, although the solo vehicle
isn’t a very outstanding work. The
concerto, the Fourth Brandenburg
Concerto in modified form, is not a
brilliant solo display piece. The solo
violin parts of the first and third
movements and the flute solos of the
second movement of the original have
been given to the harpsichord.

This was followed by the first Chi-
cago performance of Rameau’s Le ber-
ger fidele (The Faithful Shepherd).
This cantata for soprano, strings, and
harpsichord offered Janet Fairbank,
as soloist in a typical eighteenth cen-
tury pastoral, with the usual stylized
plot.

One wonders why it was necessary
to employ men from the Chicago Sym-
phony for these two works. The Uni-
versity is supposed to possess a cham-
ber orchestra for use on these pro-
grams. Last season, on two occasions,
the chamber orchestra acquitted it-
self well. Certainly the technical dif-
ficulties of the Bach and Rameau
works were not such as to render
them unencompassible by the chamber
orchestra.

After intermission Miss Fairbank
returned to sing Chausson’s ineffably
lovely Chanson perpetuelle, and Rav-
el’s Chansons madecasses (Madagas-
car Songs), which rank among the
composer’s most refined works. By
comparison with Debussy’s songs, the

Ravel may even seem
they are more tenuous
greater restraint than
Debussy’s last period.

over-refined:
and possess
do those of
Miss Fair-

bank’s voice is not particularly suited
to the three works in which she ap-
peared last Friday. Her voice, al-
though sound in its middle register,
wavered in its top register and sounded
pinched and thin; her bottom register
had a tendency to thicken.

The relieving work came at the end
in Faure’s Second Quintet in C Minor,
Op. 115, tor piano and string quartet,
played in recognition of the centenary
of the composer’s birth. Faur6 is
distinctly a connoisseur’s composer.
The Quintet, demonstrates national-
istic kinship with Debussy’s Quartet,
and one member of the audience re-
marked to me afterward that it was
curious how all French chamber misic
sounds alike. I think that this mis-
leading resemblance comes from the
refined character of the music which,
requires a close attention to fine detail.

Although the opening Allegro mod-
erato showed rough ensemble work,
the musicians, Rudolph Reuter and the
Philharmonic Quartet, settled down
to a competent performance. The
Andante moderato, was the high point
of the performance. To be fully ap-
preciated, however, the work must
have an inspired performance by flaw-

less ensemble.

There will be a meeting of the Clas-
sics Club on Thursday, January 25,
at 4:30 p.m., in the Swift Common
Room. The organization, formerly
known as the Graduate Classics Club,
will hold an election of officers at that
time.

Book Stuff

“The books we think we ought to read
are poky, dull and dry;

The books that we would like to read,
we are ashamed to buy;

The books that people talk about we
never can recall;

And the books that people give us,
oh, they’re the worst of all.”

—Carolyn Wells.

You’ll be hearing about “SRO”, a
valuable new collection of plays, com-
piled by Bennett Cerf and Van H.
Cartnell, containing the fourteen big-
gest box-office successes in the history
of the American stage. Beginning
with such old timers as “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin,” it leads you through the “Peg
O’ My Heart” period to “Tobacco
Road,” “Life with Father,” and finally
‘“Oklahoma!” But the modern plays,
even as far back as “Abie’s Irish Rose”
are easily read or even seen. It is such
bearded kernels as “The Two Orph-
ans,” “Lightnin’,” and “The Old

that are intriguing as
The peach of the lot is,
“East Lynne,” which,
, high fashion, humble
and quarts of tears, so

Homestead”
well as rare,
of course,
“miked sex,
worthiness, a

that it ran practically forever.”

In “East Lynne” appear such cele-
brated passages as: “Here I am at
length, after my absence of nearly
two years, once more in the sight of
the dear old home. But, alas! I dare
not enter for a moment. I am a fu-
gitive from justice, and even now the
lynx-eyed officers of the law may be
on my track” . . . Say the editors,
“there have been many drama antholo-
gies before this one, but all of them
consisted of plays the editors believed
people ought to like. This one in-
cludes the plays people really did like.”

Bob Marshall’s ENQUIRY BOOK-
STORE down on 57th and Kimbark
(next door to “T” Hut) ought to be
attracting quite a bit of attention.
And incidentally, the name comes
from the fact that Bob edits a maga-
zine called ENQUIRY. Right now
he’s just getting started, but Bob,
who is himself a student in the Di-
vinity School, hopes to make his store
an intellectual center of the Univer-
sity. You can already see two or
three easy chairs in the front of the
shop, where browsers are invited to
sit and read in comfort, and maybe,
if they happen to drop in on a Satur-
day afternoon, get a cup of coffee. Be-
sides the usual best sellers, and a
large bin of second hand books, Bob
will really carry a unique stock. When
his shelves are full, he will be the
only dealer in the neighborhood who
can boast of a complete stock of New
Directions, as well as numerous re-
leases from smaller publications. He
is planning on a large supply of books
from university presses from all over
the country, and will handle the more
obscure periodicals. Bob is also in-
stalling a second hand scout service,

so that if you want a used book,
find it impossible to obtain, you
arrange to have someone scour
city, to try and get it for you.

Wally, The Guard, Discusses
Diversions And Duties In Life
Of An Ida Noyes Custodian

Super-confidant of Ida Noyes hall
habitues, Wally the Guard is official
custodian of all three floors of this
recreation mausoleum as well as of all
campus secrets.

He knows the current scandal be-
fore it happens and sometimes even
scoops the Maroon.

Wally is on duty from early after-

noon until
duties are

duties.

too numerable to mention
nothing of his unofficial

One of the most burning questions
in my mind was how long it took to
grow that rather remarkable mus-
tache that adorns Wally’s upper lip.
This took some thought on his part.
“I’ve had it for twelve years now.
When I shave it off it usually takes

Russian Art
On Exhibition

Chagall’s new show at the Arts’
Club, which continues until January
31, is a comprehensive collection of his
more recent works, from ’37 to ’44. In
these, the Russian displays his usual
dreamlike fantasies combined with a
strong feeling for Russian life. He is
one of the most nationalistic of paint-
ers, and one of the few who portrays
the peasant in a lighter mood, with
a sense of humour, and without So-
cial Significance. Perhaps this is due
to the fact that he was greatly under
the influence of Leon Bakst, the great
costume and set designer of the Dia-
ghileff Ballet, who was interested in
the color, and not the problems of the
proletariat. Matisse was another fac-
tor in his development.

His subject matter is limited to the
scenes of village life, the floating at-
tenuated brides and their lovers, the
inevitable cocks and farm animals that
are appendages of his particular form
of fantasy. In this collection his
style seems a bit firmer and more
definite than usual. The composition
is still dominated by a downward diag-
onal sweep, and his palette consists of
warm, high reds, blues, and yellows,
outlined in black. There is one early
painting from 1918, a double portrait,
which he must have painted with his
tongue in his cheek. The man is sit-
ting astride the woman, and both are
leering out at the spectator with fat-
uous and coy expressions. Its inter-
est lies in the fact that it is painted
in a fairly naturalistic style, with
some cubism, and in a smooth, highly
finished technique, completely different
than his developed style. Along with
the oils there are two small, beauti-
fully done etchings, one of a reclining
nude, and the other, a fine self por-
trait. These, while not characteristic,
are as good as anything in the show.

The other artist represented in what
is practically a one man show, is
Hans Moller, an abstractionist. His
palette is sombre and greyed, and his
style linear, sometimes almost to the
point of being fragile. He seems to
have been influenced by everyone from
Paul Klee to Modigliani. All in all,
this is probably the most interesting
exhibition in town at the present, and
it would be well worth a trip to the
Wrigley Building to see it.

Muriel McChesney.

about three days to get a good start
again.”

That point settled, we went on to
discuss Wally’s night life. His favor-
ite evenings are Mondays and Fridays.
Monday nights the girls’ clubs hold
meetings which Wally apparently en-
joys-no-end. Every Friday night open
house is held. Roller skating in the
gym, bridge and ping pong on the
second floor, and dancing upstairs in
the theater. V i

Wally’s personal preferences run to
bridge and badminton. He’s a member
of the University badminton team and
has high expectations of a victory
oyer the 53rd street Y.M.C.A. on Sat-
urday afternoon.

But most of his time for the last
ten years has been spent in Ida’s main
lobby. As he says, “You get to see
the beginning and the end of every-
thing that goes on in here.”

The U.S.O. parties held on Sunday
add much to the otherwise ultra-ac-
ademic atmosphere and besides, they’re
really very quiet and well-behaved
young gentlemen.. ..the navy men, of
course.

In desperation, I asked Wally if he
knew any of the staff of the Chicago
Maroon, Chicago’s greatest newspaper.
“Oh, yes!” And which are your fav-
orites? “Oh, I couldn’t say that but
I know Don Shields and Nancy Smith
.. .and that boy over there (pointing
to a dark corner where a small group
of sinister characters were discussing
world affairs). Hill, I think his
name is.”

We leave you to Figure this one out,
and gracefully retire to the coke bar
until next week at this same time.

Sidelights on Footlights

To all those who think initiative and ingenuity are dead in
this locality, may I extend a cordial invitation to attend the first
production of the newly formed experimental theatre group, on
January 26, at 3:30 P.M. in Swift Commons. The play, a selection
from Noel Coward’s “Tonight at 8:30”, will be “The Astonished
Heart”, and the actors... well, let that be a surprise.

The idea of an experimental theatre
may sound very strange, so let me has-
ten to explain. In theory, it is a
group of actors who attempt to pro-
duce little known theatre with either
very imaginative scenery, or none at
all. In practice, at this University,
seven people have agreed to construct
the foundations of a group which will
produce one short play every other
Friday afternoon, without scenery or
costumes, just necessary props. Ad-
mission will be free, and the audience
is at liberty to attend the general
session after the play, in which the
presentation will be criticized by Mr.
Mickel and others.

I might just as well extend a warn-
ing now. What will take place next
Friday, in spite of the fact that the
comedy is being acted by talented stu-
dents, may not be good or even med-
iocre theatre. That is not to say,

This week’s column is devoted strict-
ly to the local cats ... a brief glimpse
at some of our jazz collectors on cam-
pus.

Charlie Schwartz, College 3. Eager
personality in bow tie and long over-
coat. Became interested in jazz
through his brother, a clarinetist, who
was always playing around the house,
and eventually bequeathed Charlie his
collection. Inhabits the back room of
the Groove Record Shop, where he
picks up original Louis’ and Hender-
son’s for a quarter. Exhuberant con-
versationalist with an engaging seri-
ous air; catholic jazz tastes ranging
from Jelly Roll Morton to Art Ta-
tum. Takes his collecting very seri-
ously.

Mary Beth Nelson, College 3. Dimin-
utive, dynamic chick from the wilds of
Arizona. Picked a beat up record by
some gal named Bessie Smith in a
junk shop one day, played it over,
shouted “that’s for me,” and has been
collecting blues ever since. Aspiring
modern artist, dashes off surrealistic
portraits, prose and poetry “in the
blues idiom.” Reads View, Saroyan,
and Gertrude Stein, values sincerity
above all other human traits, thinks
Josh White’s record of Fare Thee Well
is everything a work of art should be.
Takes her blues very seriously.

Bill Erlandson, College 4. Harie-
quined cat from Hinsdale, wears tailor-
made pegged pants, won a jitterbug
contest at thirteen. Has an extensive
record collection, which began with a
Benny Goodman kick, and now con-
tains rare Johnny Dodds’ and Jelly
Roll Morton’s. Possesses a subtle
and sensitive jazz appreciation be-
hind the thick line of jive picked up
from a fabulous friend named Cato,
who is perpetually staging fabulous
jam sessions. Frequents the Down
Beat Room and all the other beat
down rooms about town; has a strong
attachment for Joe Smith’s cornet
and the song Gee Baby Ain’t I Good to
You. Actually, takes his jazz very
seriously.

Second in our series of thumbnail
sketches of the local cats will appear
in this column shortly. Let me re-
iterate, if you are a jazz collector or
a musician hidden in the campus shuf-
fle, please reveal yourself to this col-
umnist.

however, that it cannot develop into
great amateur theatre. The whole
enterprise needs time, work, and above
all, support. The fact that, in the
past, dramatic events on campus have
been tenuous is due to both lack of
interest on the part of the student
body, and lack of experience on the
part of the actors. This experimental
theatre will offer the perfect oppor-
tunity for those who wish to gain
experience to see just exactly what
they can do on their own. O’Neill
and Saroyan will still survive whether
or not their one act dramas are per-
formed by this novel wing of O.D.P.
But it is doubtful if these seven ac-
tors, who have so spontaneously joined
together can long remain to function
as a unit without YOUR support.
They are stimulating amateurs, not
flawless professionals. They want
nothing but an audience.

THE CHICAGO MAROON —
People’s War?
Discussed by
Col. Carlson

Introduced as the “hero of democ-
racy,” Colonel Evens F. Carlson began
his talk on Friday with this main
question: “When is a war a people’s
war?” The concise answer to this
question is “When the people unite in
its prosecution and when the objec-
tives will benefit all the people.” Col-
onel Carlson said that the purpose of
the present war is to prevent the en-
forcement of the German and Japa-
nese way of living and government
upon us.

After expressing these general
views, he told of the specific changes
of political and social power since
1937, when the Japanese invaded
China.

While in China in 1937 Colonel
Carlson was deeply impressed by the
people’s determination to win the
war. With the help of cooperatives
and a system of public education, they
found out exactly what they were
fighting for. Consequently, their re-
sistance became stronger and more
unified. Their cause has also made
possible great progress toward free-
dom of speech and press.

In closing,. Col. Carlson said that if,
with the changes in government, Chi-
na can see the advantages of demo-
cratic principles, she will rapidly
move forward.

with a heart-of-oak
durability ;

Among the many evidences that back
up our position as a haven for men who
desire a certain type of hose are these
special all wool imports; finely woven
and full-fashioned to be as practical
as they are masculinely good looking.

(Continued from page one)

The desire to allow each hall to
“solve its own problems” was ex-
pressed by Jean Gatewood, in opposi-
tion to the principle of a government,
representative of all campus housing
units, which would establsh a com-
prehensive program of policy and ac-
tion for all houses, thus furthering
the integration of the College. Other
suspicions expressed were that Dean
of Students Kimpton would be enabled
to make rules, if a dormitory council
existed, rules that he cannot make
now, and that The Chicago Maroon
has some ulterior motive in actively
campaigning for dormitory self-gov-
ernment on an over-all scale.

Film Group to Show
Aviation History

The Documentary Film Group is
presenting three films on its program
next Tuesday. The films, which depict
the history of aviation, are “Conquest
of the Air,” “Sky Giant,” and South of
the Border,” and are scheduled for
eight o’clock in Social Science 122.

Evans...

(Continued from page one)
have been many. When he assumed
directorship of the Choir, its activi-
ties, as well as the University’s re-
ligious services, were held in Mandel
Hall. Previous to the dedication of
Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, in Oc-
tober, 1928, Mr. Evans, with the build-
er Ernest Skinner, was responsible for
the design and specifications of the
Chapel organs. It was he who per-
suaded the architect to equip the south
gallery for the Choir, and to install
the organ and case now there, none of
which were originally called for in
the plans of the building.

With the aid of Frank O’Hara and
Louise Ayres Garnett, Mr- Evans be-
gan the series of Christmas pageants
in the Chapel, which have become a
Christmas institution at the Univer-
sity. He introduced the Tenebrae ser-
vice, modelled after European cathe-
dral usage, and the Epiphany Feast
of Lights, after the ritual in Christ
Church, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The Choir, under his leadership, has
given concerts with the University
Orchestra, and with the Chicago Sym-
phony Orchestra.

After such services to the Univer-
sity, we can only echo Cecil Smith,
“Since Mr. Evans has decided to seek
new laurels in another field, I can only
wish him all the success he deserves
and most certainly will have in his
new and challenging association with
Robert Shaw in the Fred Waring or-
ganization. The Chapel Choir will
remain a challenge to his successor
and a model for choral organizations
everywhere.”

Nisei Students
Will Address
Calvert Club

“We want to meet and exchange
ideas with the Caucasians; to show
that we, too, are Americans. We want
to draw the line between Japanese and
Japanese-Americans,” said Phil Na-
gao, Nisei student, as he told of plans
for next Sunday’s Calvert Club meet-
ing.

A group of over one hundred
American Japanese Catholics of Chi-
cago, most of them evacuated from the
west coast since the war, will hold
an organization meeting in the after-
noon from 3:30-5:00 p.m., at the De
Sales House, 5735 University. At eight
that evening they will meet with the
Calvert Club to discuss the topic,
“Evacuation and the Nisei”. Speakers
will be Louise Suski and Brother Theo-
thane Walsh of the Mary knoll Mission.

Maria and Cecelia Miyamoto will
entertain with a musical program.
Cecelia is a prize-winning violinist
and Maria is an accomplished pianist.
Refreshments will be served in the
club rooms.

The Catholic Nisei group has met
several times informally at the in-
stigation of Bishop Sheil of the C.Y.O.,
but Sunday afternoon will see the or-
ganization set up.

W.S.S.F. Drive
Will Help War
Prisoner’s Aid

During the last few years millions
of soldiers have been made prisoners
of war. The large number of Ameri-
can airmen in German hands has
created the need for special prison
camps. Through the World Student
Service Fund Drive, to be held on
campus from February 6th through
February 16th, there will be an op-
portunity for University people to
help these war victims.

In close co-operation with the War
Prisoners’ Aid of the Y.M.C.A., the
International Red Cross, and the In-
ternational Bureau of Education, the
W.S.S.F. provides various kinds of aid
for prisoners. Through the Geneva
office, men have an opportunity to in-
dicate the books and other items that
they would like to have. One office
has the records of 15,000 students who
received individual attention.

Study goes on in practically all of
the major divisions of knowledge. The
United States Armed Forces Insti-
tute has established a special com-
mittee to organize, supervise and ap-
praise the studies of American pris-
oners. They hope to give a card of
proficiency which can be .presented to
any American university after the
war.

Students who wish to take any
comprehensive examinations to be
ogered in the Winter Quarter
should register on or before Feb-
ruary 1 in Cobb Hall, Room 100.
The office hours are from 10:00
A.M. to 12:00 M., and from 2:00
until 4:00 PP.M., except on Satur-
day, when the office is open from

26 TEAMS PLAY INTRAMURAL BALL

WILLIAMS

Geo.

PLAYS HOST
TO MAROONS

George Williams College plays host
to the Maroons tomorrow night in
the Chicago team’s last appearance
of this season. The Maroon men go
into Saturday’s contest with a 7-6
record on the plus side. If all goes
well, as it did against Wheaton, the
University should close its most suc-
cessful season since 1938 with a bet-
ter than .570 rating.

The University squad defeated Wil-
liams before the holidays by 9 points,
39 to 30, with DeGraw, Kuhn, Raby
and Brokken having a merry time in
the scoring columns. A difference in
points may be registered by the change
in floors and spectators as the George
Williams students who visited the
Fieldhouse were anything but quiet
during the game. It is generally con-
ceded by all concerned that the added
length of the Maroon’s home floor is
good for a usual 5 points against any
visiting team.

This game will mark the last ap-
pearance on the floor of most of the
regular players. The Navy contin-
gents, including Brokken, Kuhn,
Dahms, Adams, Breuklander and the
other service members of the squad,
is moving out and with its leaving
will go several fine players.

Howard Brokken has been one of
the most consistent of Coach Nels
Norgren’s players. He has never
scored less than six points in one
game and in most contests his points
have gone into the double figures.
Bob Kuhn, the other outstanding Navy
regular, ran into some trouble with a
bad leg but he, too, turned in several
good point making demonstrations.

John Sharp, only third year college
regular, put on a sensational show
against Wheaton with his long shots
but Sharp, too, will soon leave the
quadrangles for Merchant Marine ca-
det school.

Survey on Physical Education
Proves Success of Program

Following through on the idea of a broad outlook on all
branches of education, the University’s athletic department intro-
duced survey courses in general sports. J. Kyle Anderson, director
of these courses has announced, after a full quarter’s programs,
that the idea has proved highly successful.

Instruction in the season’s sports
has been carried out through the au-
tumn and beginning of the winter
quarter with required attendance for
men in the first two years of the col-
lege and voluntary participation for
men in the upper college and Univer-
sity. These three classes have cover-
ed the elementary stages of group
and individual play in varied activities
while separate groups have been
formed in the more advanced and spe-
cialized brackets of play. That is,
while the 101, 102, and 103 groups
are schooled in several sports per
season, the more advanced classes,
which in many cases are actually var-
sity teams, devote their entire class
periods to their individualized sport.

Specialized, Advance Classes

Thus, in the case of Mr. E. W. Mc-
Gillivray, physical education instruc-
tor and varsity swim coach, McGil-
livray instructs classes in general
swimming for 101, 102 and 103 while
at the same time he conducts a separ-

Big Ten Meet, Minnesota, Purdue

Jack Hill

Time In

“Football is not a subject on which I am competent to com-
ment”, so spoke President Hutchins when Herb Graffis, Chicago
sport’s writer approached the University head with some ques-
tions for a poll in this month’s issue of ESQUIRE. And that poll
is quite a thing.. .while the college presidents condemn football
with a 60 to 70 per cent vote, the general public backs up the grid
iron game by percentages well in the 90’s. The ESQUIRE writers
conclude many of their findings with the question, who’s out of
step here?”

Indoor Thinclads to
Meet Northwestern

Ned Merriam, varsity track mentor,
announced that the University has
scheduled 7 meets for the indoor track
season. They include contests with
Northwestern, Purdue, Wisconsin,
Iowa, and Minnesota. The competi-
tion represents Chicago’s only remain-
ing conference encounters with Big
Nine schools.

Six of the seven meets are sched-
uled for the University Fieldhouse
with one meet against Northwestern
and Iowa at Iowa City. The final
meet of the season at the present time
is the Big Ten Indoor Conference tilt,
charted for March 10 at the Field-
house.

Prospects, according to Merriam,
are much brighter than they were a
year ago, although the men out at the
present time are largely 17-year-olds.
The largest hole in the lineup is the
lack of pole-vaulters and Merriam has
sounded a call for every possible man
on campus to com*) out for instruction
if he has any interest in vaulting.

Leading the squad in experience are
a miler and a hurdler, Al Friedlander,
ranked number two in Mississippi mile
contests and Paul Russell, medical
school student and a return performer
from last year’s squad.

The able track coach wishes it im-
pressed upon the minds of any men
who have had experience in high school
or in other colleges to come out as
quickly as possible.

The complete schedule is as follows: A
dual meet against Northwestern at the Field-
house, Jan. 27; a quadrangular meet against
Purdue, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Northwest-
ern at the Fieldhouse, Feb. 3; Wayne Univer_
sity visits Chicago, Feb. 10; Northwestern and
Chicago go to Iowa City to meet Iowa on Feb.
17; North Central comes here Feb. 24; a tri-
angular meet with Minnesota and Iowa here,
March 3 and to close the season, the Big Ten
Indoor Track Meet at the Fieldhouse March 10.

ate class for advanced swimmers and
the varsity team. This holds true for
Hermanson in fencing, Vorres in
wrestling and boxing and the other
members of the physical education
staff whom we shall mention in follow-
ing articles.

The 103 class and the advanced
classes are open to faculty members
as well as students and it is interest-
ing to note the reaction of several of
the faculty men who have taken class-
es and have reported favorably to the
Dean’s offices. A professor in the
school of medicine, in a letter to Dean
Kimpton, mentioned the fact that the
instructors availed themselves of the
opportunity to tie in elementary phys-
iology and biology with the athletics
being taught and furthermore took
into special cognizance the lack of
several of the individual sports which
will prove valuable to the student not
only at the present time but when
they have left school and are forced
to exercise individually.

Take a glance at it and let us know
your opinions, will you? There’s
nothing like a hot debate to further
progressive education. /
♦ ♦ ♦

Good news from Ned Merriam on
the indoor track front as the Univer-
sity successfully arranged meets with
several of the Big Ten (or is it Nine)
schools. If fate deals us a kind blow,
which this school is about due for in
athletics, we may take quite a few
of those meets. And men who should
know say that the best way for this
University to get back in the Big
(there’s that word again) Nine, is to
turn in a good season in any one sport.

Squash Club
Tied for 2nd
In City League

As defending Class “B” champions
in the city league, the Midway Squash
Club is tied for second place this sea-
son in the city tournament schedule
to be played off through March 17.

Two teams comprise the club. Each
week the victors of interteam compe-
tition, as chalked up on the West Stand
challenge board, are chosen to repre-
sent the University in outside matches.
The first five men on the list play for
team No. 1, the second five men make
up team No. 2. By using this method,
team members alternate weekly, and
interest in the team makeup is stimu-
lated.

Matches, open without charge to the
public, are held Saturday afternoons
between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m. at the Lake
Shore Club. Men only are admitted
to the matches held at the Chicago
Athletic Association.

The remainder of the season will
have the following teams competing at
the L.S.C.: Dartmouth vs. Lake Shore,
Jan. 20; Lawson “Y” vs. Chicago Ath-
letic Club, Jan. 27; Hyde PaPrk “Y”
vs. Illinois Athletic Club, Feb. 3; U. of
C. team No. 2 vs. U. of C. team No. 1,
Feb. 17; Chicago Athletic Club vs.
Lawson “Y”, Feb. 24; and Lake Shore
Club vs. Dartmouth, March 3.

Matches scheduled for the C.A.A.
are: Illinois Athletic Club vs. Hyde
Park “Y”, Feb. 10; Dartmouth Club
vs. Lake Shore, March 10; and Chi-
cago Athletic Club vs. Lawson “Y”,
March 17.

Undefeated Rifle Team

The senior Maroon rifle team won
its eighth match in a row against
Chicago Bridge Club while the senior
White squad was losing to the Com-
monwealth Edison squad. Morgan
Park Military Academy was dealt a
914-848 defeat by the red hot junior
squad which recently triumphed over
the Lane Tech squad also.

This might show the doubting Thom-
ases that Chicago could hold its own
on any front in athletics.

Before the upper college section of
the intramural league got under way
there was a hot argument, but all is
calm at present. The issue, VAR-
SITY players, was hotly contested
for one night until NICK PARISI,
navy veteran and intramural president,
ruled with the agreement of a ma-
jority of the team captains, that
VARSITY men will be ineligible for
the entire season.

And by the way, NICK has done a
fine job. With very little time and a
heavy schedule he has turned the
leagues in to a going concern.

P. S.: Varsity men can referee
anyhow.

Chicago Takes
Second Game
From Wheaton

Nels Norgren’s ‘informal’ Maroons
dealt Wheaton College its second Chi-
cago defeat last Tuesday, 59-54, at
the Wheaton gym. Wheaton actually
lost the game twice having a 14 point
lead at one time, and having an 8
point advantage over the University
at the half.

Tuesday was Chicago’s best night
at the basket this season, as Fred
Degraw dropped in 18 points, John
Sharp swished 7 one handed push
shots from 30 feet out, plus one gift
toss and Howie Brokken scored 14
points. George Raby, moved over to
forward for a short time, put in 4
buckets while Adams, Navy center,
scored 3 tallies and Dahms dropped
in a beautiful long shot.

The Chicago boys had trouble with
Wheaton’s offensive use of a 2-1-2 set
up play, but in the second half the
Maroon five started to press their men
at all times, and gradually overcame
a bad disadvantage. DeGrew’s superb
ball handling and play-making, plus
Johnnny Sharp’s phenomonal accuracy
from way out on the floor, kept the
University in the game until the whole
team began to hit. Chicago took a
2 point lead with about 10 minutes to
play, but was hard pressed to match
baskets with Wheaton for several
minutes. They finally dropped in an
extra 3 points and thus held their 5
point winning margin. . . . J. H.

CAGE LOOPS
OPEN SLATE

One of the most comprehensive
intramural basketball programs

swung into action last Tuesday
with a Commuter team winning
its first game from the Burton
‘500’ entry and the Burton ‘600’
entry swamping the Burton ‘800’
entry. Both teams are in the
1st two year league.

The Commuters scored 23
points to 500’s 6 baskets with
Newbury of the winning team
scoring 6 points. Burton *600’
ran away from 800, 46 to 11 as
Morgan dropped in 16 points for
the victors and Collins scored 5
for 800.

College Heavies Win
Fourth Straight Tilt

Last Friday, January 12, the Heavy
Basketball Team of the first two years
of the College extended its 1945 win-
ning streak to four straight by de-
feating North Shore Country Day
School 29 to 26 at Winnetka, Illinois.
The game was close throughout and
although the Maroons’ offensive play
was not up to its usual standard, the
Chicago boys led for all but a few
minutes of the second quarter. “Cur-
ley” Norm Heffron and Bill Gray led
in the scoring department; each with
ten tallies.
