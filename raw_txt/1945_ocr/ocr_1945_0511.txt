PRESIDENT ROBERT M. HUTCHINS ON V-E DAY

'We Must Sacrifice For
World Peace'-Hutchins

In a plea for lasting peace before an overflow throng of nearly
2,500 persons at Rockefeller Chapel on V-E Day, Robert M.
Hutchins, president of the University, urged that “mercy and
justice” dictate Allied policy toward Germany and Japan after
the war.

Expect 600 Sunday
For Club Songfest

Over 600 persons are expected Sun-
day at the annual Inter Club Sing in
which nine women’s clubs are partic-
ipating. The Sing will be held on
the Ida Noyes green from 2:30 to
4:00, if good weather prevails; other-
wise, it will be in the gymnasium.
Sing judges Hans Lange, Remi Gass-
mann, and Scott Goldthwaite will
award the cup.

His brief, 17-minute address, one
of the most challenging he has yet
delivered on postwar problems, sup-
ported restoration of Germany and
Japan; warned that economic regula-
tions will be necessary until the final
defeat of Japan; and asserted that a
world security program entails sacri-
fices and “paying for it.”

Hutchins’ remarks featured a 30-
minute all-campus V-E day program
and magnetized one of the largest
audiences ever to attend services at
the University cathedral. The entire
V-E DAY, P. 3, Col. 1

Rally

Widespread campus interest in the
United Nations conference being held
in San Francisco will focus on a
giant all-campus meeting Tuesday,
May 15, at 3:30 p.m. in Mandel Hall

A group of interested students
have secured prominent speakers, and
the program will include Paul Robe-
son, now starring in “Othello”, and T.
Walter Johnson, professor of history.

All persons on campus may attend
the meeting. Heading the sponsoring
group are: Jessie Polacheck, Allan
Rosenblatt, and Mary Alice Reed.
Veterans’ Council; Young Women’s
Christian Association, American
Youth for Democracy, Hillel, Inter-
Fraternity Council, and THE CHI-
CAGO MAROON have all helped in
planning this meeting.

Mary Alice Reed, chairman of pub-
licity, announces that “Because of
the great nignificance of the con-
ference and because we feel its im-
plications and ramifications will be
felt by every student on this campus,
we have sensed a necessity for know-
ledge of the issues at stake.”

$14,000 Given Red
Cross by Chicago

The University contributed $14,567
to the national Red Cross drive, ac-
cording to figures released yesterday
jy Mrs. Robert Woeliner and Dean

Maroon Ranked
As All-American

The CHICAGO MAROON has
been awarded the 1945 Superior
All-America rating by the As-
sociated Collegiate press in com-
petition with other weekly college
newspapers, it was announced at
Minneapolis yesterday.

The judgment was based on
issues of the newspaper published
from September to January of the
present year. Seven other news
papers received the award with
the Maroon in the 2,500-5,000 en-
rollment class.

ACP officials noted that this is
the first time that THE MAROON
has been granted the award.

By ALAN J. STRAUSS

Complete overhauling of the University dormitory system to
include the granting of dormitory memberships to all college stu-
dents and merger of the college advisory system with the dormi-
tory program are the two key points of sweeping, though long-
range, changes projected for the College residence program,
University authorities revealed yesterday.

The proposals are included in a
memorandum defining the relation-
ships between the College academic
plan and the extra-curricular activi-
ties which has been released exclu-
sively to THE CHICAGO MAROON
by Dean of Students Lawrence A.
Kimpton.

The memorandum, which was draft-
ed by Kimpton in conjunction with
Lieutenant Colonel Alan L. Chidsey,
who is slated to become director of
the residence program upon his re-
lease from the army, has been ap-
proved by President Hutchins and
Dean of the College Clarence A.
Faust.

All student activities should be
subordinated to the College curri-
culum, but these extra-curricular
activities, arising out of student in-
itiative, should bear a direct relation-
ship to the curriculum, the memoran-
dum assserts.

Kimpton emphasized that the plans
must await more dormitory facilities
and a larger faculty for their ex-
ecution, necessarily a long term pro-
cess. He said that when the plan is
in full operation, most of the College
activities will be organized around
the dormitory program. Every stu-
dent, whether resident or commuter,
will hold membership in one of the

houses. ,

Each house, under the plan, will be
occupied by between thirty-five and
sixty student residents, one resident
head, and one or two resident assist-
ants. In addition there will be be-
tween forty and sixty-five associate

Wednesday

An all-campus meeting sponsored
by the Student Political Action Com-
mittee of the Labor Rights society,
opposing enactment of postwar mili-
tary training legislation, is scheduled
here Wednesday night at 8 at Mandel

President Hutchins will be the
feature speaker of the anti-conscrip-

mission charge.

Following the meeting a resolution
is expected to be passed condemning
pasage of the May bill, now before
Congress, which if passed would re-
quire military training. A petition
is also being circulated among faculty
members condemning the bill.

Plans Visit to
Campus May 25
English Professor Emeritus
To Teach at Puerto Rico U.

By ALBERT FRIEDLANDER

Robert Morss Lovett, ex-Govem-
ment Secretary of the Virgin Islands
and Professor Emeritus of English
at the University of Chicago, will
be in Chicago May 25 for an ex-
tended visit.

Lovett was Government Secretary
of the Virgin Islands until two years
ago, when Congress cut off the sala-
ry of the office, thus abolishing it.
This was the direct result of an
“exposition” by the Dies Committee
on his alleged “subversive activities.”
Preceding that he was a professor of
English literature at the University
of Chicago for 45 years, and an as-
sociate editor of the New Republic
for twenty years. Since last year
Lovett has been visiting professor
at the University of Puerto Rico,
where two of his oldest friends, also
Professors Emeritus of The Univer-
sity of Chicago are teaching. Percy
Holmes Boynton, Professor Emeri-
tus of English, has been there one
year, and Ferdinand Schevill has
taught there since the fall quarter.

Lovett was in the city last fall
together with his family. He expects
to remain here this year until Au-
gust, when he will take Mrs. Lovett
back to Puerto Rico.

“The purpose of The University of
Chicago Critic will be to offer to all
members of the University a bi-
weekly picture of current opinion and
activity arising on the Quadrangles.
It will include both perception of the
real and conception of the imaginary,”
said J. William Lenz, Editor-in-Chief
of the forthcoming student opinion
publication at a staff meeting Tues-
day.

The magazine will represent the
first campus-wide movement in this
field in more than a year. Because of
the all inclusive interest instigated by
a long run view of reviews, literary,
and social material, a systematic me-
thod of circulation is being worked
out to insure complete coverage of
campus focal points it was announced.

meeting this week.

Kimpton, guest of the council,
pointed out that the lack of students
in the first two years of the divisions
or conventional junior or senior years,
handicap fraternities on the Chica-
go campus. He described that div-
isional zone as “no-man’s land.”

Kimpton and Jim Halvorsen, presi-
dent of the IF, were later dinner
guests of Phi Gamma Delta at the
chapter house.

National president of Phi Gamma
Delta, Louis E. Leverone spoke to
the Fijis at their initiation dinner
last Monday evening as four neo-

to it. Upon being questioned later
he explained the vocational bureau
of Phi Gamma Delta which he or-
ganized in 1923. With the slogan
“Jobs for Fijis and Fijis for Jobs”,
the bureau is now turning its atten-
tion to positions for the discharged

an all-student committee.

“We have come now to the real test
of our ideals for the sake of which
we entered the war,” Hutchins told
the gathering, less than 3 hours after
President Truman had informed the
world in an international radio
hookup that Germany had surren-
dered unconditionally. “We entered
the war not to save our skins, but to
make possible a just, a human society
which should embrace all the peoples
of earth,” he said, and added that “if
that is what we want, we must now
sacrifice, not only our lives but our
goods to save millions of our fellow-
men from starvation and from the
moral and political distintegration
which starvation will carry with it.”

Hutchins denounced those who sup-
port a policy of vengeance toward
Germany. He quoted Edmund Burke,
18th century English orator, in de-
claring that “we do not know a method
of drawing up an indictment against
a whole people.”

18-MonthWar In Licking Japs

By JOAN KOHN

That it will take at least six months to transport fresh troops to Japan,
and probably a year after that to defeat Nippon is the opinion of Dr. Chiang
Mon-lin, president of the National University of Peking and of the Chinese
Red Cross who appeared on campus Wednesday to deliver a lecture on
“Dictatorhsip and Democracy in China.”

In an interview with the CHICAGO MAROON he further said that “the
only way to deal with Japan after the war is to completely demilitarize the
country.”

Concerning the outcome of the San Francisco Conference Dr. Chiang is
optimistic. “We can at least get a basic world organization,” he commented,
“and any type or organization is better than none.”

Dr. Chiang headed the Chinese delegation to the Institute of Pacific
Relations Conference, held last month, and will remain in the United States
for a few months to study educa. .tional conditions here.

the program.

The end of the European war came
quietly to the University. THE CHI-

had announced the war’s end, was
the first formal reaction. Scores of
tributes to the extra were received by
staff members of THE MAROON

Editorial

Give Us Lebensraum

This is a story behind a mountain of facts
and figures. It is a story of a dream, not a pipe-
smoke fairy tale, but one which represents the
University of Chicago in the world of tomorrow.

When the College was founded, pompous Uni-
versity administrators the nation over snorted
in amazement and disgust. They spoke of ‘‘fan-
tastic blueprints of wild-eyed medievalists”;
they cried that the plan would suffocate from
lack of students and public interest. But an
entirely different tale has been inked into the
history of American education, and today, de-
spite the disparagement and denunciation of the
misguided and uninformed, the Chicago plan has
been established as an overwhelming success.

The same foresight which brought the Col-
lege plan into being has now veered into new
channels. The problem of establishment is over.
The huge question mark has become one of
growth and expansion. While the phenomenally
meteoric rise of yesterday is over, we may con-
fidently anticipate a constant upward swing.
University administrators, a cautious lot by na-
ture, need gaze through no rose-tinted spectacles
to predict that within seven or eight years the
enrollment in the College will have soared to a
ceiling of 3,000. Within the next three years,
at least 2,500 students are expected to be mov-
ing through the four-year College program. It
is already manifestly evident that there will be
no dearth of applicants. In January, the Office
of Admissions rejected fifty applicants with all
the necessary qualifications. Army demobiliza-
tion plans will unquestionably add to the bom-
bardment of admission requests.

The problem of a faculty, a troublesome ques-
tion during the war, will also be solved with the
end of hostilities. Younger men — those most
suitable for teaching in the College—have been
on leave for military service during the past
three years. They will flock back in steadily
increasing numbers in the days to come.

Neither does the question of classroom facil-
ities present an insurmountable barrier. Recon-
version and the end of the military programs on
the Quadrangles will pave the way for a return
to normal in that department.

The crucial limitation, however, and the tre-

the New York Times published the
results of a history survey conducted
among 7,000 college freshmen in 36
colleges and Universities. Boners
pulled by freshmen included attribut-
ing the New Deal to Theodore Roose-
velt, who was identified as a forest
ranger and a general in World War I.

Ohio University’s historical depart-
ment is divided on the subject The
majority of its members are agreed
on three points: the inadequacy of
history teaching lies mainly with the
high schools, the questions asked in
the New York Times survey were not
broad enough in nature, and Ohio
State’s history requirements are sa-
tisfactory.

Dr. Eugene H. Roseboom believes
that “history is the worst taught sub-
ject in high schools with the excep-
tion of English.” Most of the depart-
ment members in this camp agree
that better preparation of high school

Innuendoes

mendously difficult problem yet to be solved is
that of housing and dormitory facilities. Hous-
ing Bureau statistics tell the story tersely: Uni-
versity housing facilities are already packed to
near saturation. We are literally bulging at the
seams. At International House there are several
times as many applicants as there are rooms
available. All other dormitory units on the
Quadrangles, including Hitchcock Hall, which
may be returned to the University by fall, can
provide facilities for no more than 900 students.
Additional room is temporarily available through
fraternity houses, which will, however, be re-
turned to their owners with the collapse of Japan.

At the current time, 36 per cent of all Col-
lege students, or about 600 matriculants, are
housed by the University. It is crystal clear
that this percentage will continue to mount.
As the College plan becomes more widely known,
a constantly higher percentage of out-of-town
students will pour into the University. Three
years ago it was 28 per cent of all third-year
entrants; last year it was 40 per cent. The
attendance in the first two years is also shooting
skyward, and most of these students don’t call
the Windy City their own stomping grounds.

That’s the story statistically. Total housing
facilities excepting International House: 884.
Exclude Blake and Gates Halls, which University
bigwigs confess are inadequate for College pur-
poses. Total: 762. (And note that available
facilities for the 2200 students not in the College,
excluding International House, total the incred-
ibly infinitesimal sum of 122.) Contemplated
College enrollment by 1948: 2500. And yet it
is evident by the most cursory observations
that the highest possible enrollment which the
College could maintain under present conditions
could not exceed 2100, far below the anticipated
demands.

The answer is obvious: more dormitory fa-
cilities are needed. If the College is to continue
to grow beyond next fall, with its planned enroll-
ment of 2000, if the Chicago plan is to become
the revolutionary success it can and must be,
then it is vital that the appropriate authorities
act swiftly and without hesitation. It is not too
soon to draft blueprints, to allocate funds.

Americans Don9t Know Own

Columbus, Ohio, May 10 (ACP).—Do Americans know their
own history? “No,” wrote Henry F. Pringle who fired another
salvo at American educators on this controversial subject in the
January 20 issue of the Saturday Evening Post, And “No,” re-
affirmed members of the Ohio State University Department of His-
tory who discussed the subject recently at a departmental meeting.

history teachers is needed; that coa-

are not qualified history teachers.

Dr. Francis P. Weisenburger sug-
gests the necessity for a better ar-
rangement whereby the same ma-
terial will not be duplicated at differ-
ent levels. He believes that “efforts to
interest the student have resulted
in the watering down of content. His-
tory can be presented in an interest-
ing and vital way without having to
dilute it so much.”

Dr. Eugene H. Rosenbloom believes
that the universities cannot avoid
their responsibility by blaming the
secondary schools for inadequate
preparation. “What we need,” he be-
lieves, “is more interpretation of his-
tory and less emphasis on detailed
content Detail is important only as
it illustrates general principles and
underlying trends which have their
relevancy today.”

A Liquid Afternoon

A questionnaire distributed among various College students
asks a question as to whether liquor regulations at the University
are too lax, too stringent, or between the two extremes. After the
Green Hall open house Sunday we are still undecided as to the
answer. All varieties of liquor were found as well as all stages of
happiness. (We did hear one coy remark, “I’m the shy type—
let’s go in the closet...”) Vaguely we were reminded of the days
two or three years ago when any morning one would see lines of
bottles adorning the windows of Green Hall.

Philadelphia Story

The custom of offering star performers sundry corsages was continued
at the Philly Story last Friday—Bill Flory was presented with a magnificent
vegetable corsage. Another anecdote anent the play concerns the large sign
which hung between two trees on the walk between Kent and Cobb. It seems
a strong wind (with the aid of two park benches piled on top of each other,
a tall male, and three typical U. of C. women) blew the sign off, complete
with ropes, and deposited it across Roberta Unger’s room with the ropes
tied carefully and securely to radiators, steam pipes, etc.

Day of Celebration?

A few weeks ago the Burton 200 entry decided to make a great day of it
and have everyone appear in dark glasses a la Sig Johnson. Lately, said
Johnson has taken to wearing his tie tucked neatly in his pocket. The other

in pockets. We are waiting raptly for the day they all show up with Corrina

Study U. C. Impact On Students

Definite proposals for revamp-
ing the College in certain areas
are expected to be made by a
Committee for Evaluating the
College which has conducted an
investigation during the past
year in an effort to determine
the University's influence and
contribution to its students, THE
CHICAGO MAROON learned
yesterday.

The faculty committee making the
study will attempt to follow up the
lives of the students after they leave
the College, comparing them with a
like number of students similar in
characteristics including intelligence,

Laud Program
By Orchestra

By DON WEEKS

The Concert of the Chamber Orch-
estra of the University, presented at
Mandel Hall Wednesday evening
under the direction of Hans Lange
and Clarke Kessler, was a decided
success. The respectable musician
ship of the orchestra and Mr. Lange
compensated for the occasional lapses
in technical proficiency of the play-
ers. Undeniably this fault is a
pardonable failing of such non-pro-
fessional organizations.

The program was interesting and
varied, and without exception was
given a proficient and workmanship
reading by Mr. Lange and the mem-
bers of the orchestra. The program
consisted of Six Dances from “La
Rosiore Rtpublicaine” by Gr^try; The
Concerto in E flat major major for
piano with accompaniment of violins
and violincelli of J. C. Bach; Three
Equali, for four trombones by Beeth-
oven; Haydn’s “Surprise” Symphony
and the Chorale and Fugue by Bach-
Abert.

The Six Dances were executed with
that vivacity and lightness appro-
priate to this quaint and thinly
harmonized music. The soloist for
the Bach Concerto for piano was
PerryO’Neil. The pianist played
meticulously and showed a feeling for
nuance and nicety of phrasing in his
cadenzaes, but, unfortunately, he
lacked spirit and drive.

background, but who have either at-
tended other institutions or dropped

schools, nearby suburban high schools,
and other schools throughout the

Through. extensive examinations,
questionnaires, and personal inter-
views throughout several years to

the College students, the committee
hopes to see what changes occur in
the individual and the extent to which
the College may be responsible for
these changes.

Servin' It Hot

Burton Lounge rocked to the Chi-
cago beat last Sunday afternoon as
Bud Jacobson’s Jungle Kings revived
the true spirit of the jam session be-
fore a group of enthusiastic listeners.
Attendance was disappointing, es-
pecially in view of the really rare
and fine jazz produced. However,
what the crowd lacked in number it
made up for in spirit. Nor was this
missed on the musicians, who ex-
pressed an appreciation for the en-
thusiasm, and also the good taste
expressed by the audience.

Off campus attendance ran high,
accounting for representatives from
the Chicago Sun, Down Beat, Jazz
Session, and Session records. Also
noteworthy was the appearance of
Professor William O’Meara of the
Philosophy Department, who re-
mained to the end.

The band warmed up on the blues,
after which Danny Gerald introduced
George Hoefer of Down Beat, who
emceed for the afternoon. In true
Jam session style (both musicians
and audience were very happy when
coats were shorn and any indica-
tions of the “concert” level were
abandoned) George bantered with
the audience between numbers while
the musicians conferred about the
next tune.

The Jungle Kings’ repertoire was
composed of such jazz evergreens as:
Jazz Me Blues, Black and Blue, Sis-
ter Kate, Confessin’, Nobody's Sweet-
heart, and Bugle Call Rag.

Letters to the Editor

Dorm Policies in Muddle
Charges Blake Resident
An Open Letter to Mrs. Barbara K. Anthony, Resident Adviser, Women’s
Resident Halls.

My dear Mrs. Anthony;

This is an appeal on a question which I feel to be important to me and
to all University students. It concerns the policy which is pursued regarding
the rights and prerogatives to students at present residing in the residence
halls and those seeking admission into the same. To date, you have not made
any statement upon the standards for eligibility, the standards for women
living in the dormitories, and the basis for placement in certain halls.

Until that time, I and others living under the University housing plan
can only hold ourselves responsible for any of my actions. The problem lies
in being reprimanded for breaking rules which are very arbitrary and liable
to any interpretation. I realize that an unordered life is not classified as
“clean living” (in reference to Dean Kimpton’s letter to Women’s resident
halls of last fall), but just what is meant by clean living? I have been
forced, not by choice, to interpret the term as I see fit.

Moreover, the assistance of the school psychiatrist, or a person similarly
qualified, would be of immeasurable aid in making any decisions based on
personal judgment of the character and the emotional stability of any indi-
vidual in question. Furthermore, once a student has been admitted to the
University (and this in itself is a highly selective process) is he not entitled
to the same privileges of his fellow students? Is he to be refused admission
to certain halls because of a discrepancy in the color of his skin ? In view of
the University’s liberal policy, it appears to be very inconsistent.

As a student of the University, I feel it essential that these matters be
made articulate and explicit. I do not want to be part of an institution which
operates on an undemocratic basis. Whatever your policy is, we should be
in a position to see it, and if necessary, act upon it.

Very sincerely yours,

Dians Senor, Blake Hall

'Philadelphia9
Wows Throngs

By MARABELLE SMITH

Phillip Barry’s bedtime tale for
adults, “The Philadelphia Story” was
O.D.P.’s most enjoyable play of the
season. If there were any doubts as
to how a group of amateurs would
be in this sophisticated saga, they
were mostly dispelled because of the
acting of the principles

Seeing the play again, I felt that
Barry’s intention had been to con-
struct a play of character, by show-
ing the humanization of a Philadel-
phia blueblood. In this he was not
wholly successful, since the organiz-
ing principle is wit, rather than cha-
racter; the latter being often sacri-
ficed in favor of the former.

Merle Sloan as Tracy Lord had a
doubly difficult job because she had
quite a predecessor in the person of
Katherifie Hepburn. To say that she
acquitted herself is to state an agree-
able fact. If at first she was more
sophisticated than goddesslike, she
compensated for it by her warm,
restrained performance in the third
act, which was her best.

Billy Flory as Mike was slick and
overly supercilious, possibly a mis-
conception of the part. And yet, Mr.
Flory seems wise in the ways of
comedy.

If his Macaulay Connor did not
seem capable of writing two books
which were “almost poetry” that is
probably Philip Barry’s fault and not
Bill Flory’s. I think, tho, a mistake
was made when Sid Levy was not
cast as the reporter and Flory as
Dexter Haven. Levy’s C.K. Dexter
Haven was passable, but he would
have been much better as Mike. He-
len Auerbach’s Dinah was delightful.
Her interpretation was not that of
a hoyden, but of a sweet little brat,
for which her voice had just the
proper degree of squeakiness.

I thought Mary Diamond very fine
as Liz Imbrie. Unlike some of the
others, she believes in understate-
ment, which still allows her to be
vastly amusing.

The others in the cast did not fare
so well. Jean Cooke as Margaret was
more the ingenue than the mother.
One couldn’t believe that Tracy could
be even remotely fond of George Kitt-
redge as rendered by Robert Brooks.
In a moment of high tension, Mr.
Brooks puffed up his cheeks several
times to denote rage. Not only was
this inappropriate for George, but it
also seems a bit antiquated as a thea-
trical device. Robert Voas had a few
good moments as Sandy Lord but
there were too many extraneous gri-
maces. Roy Pakensky was funny in a
coy fashion as that fanny-pincher,
Uncle Willie. Seth Lord as done by
Alan Boulton was effective, but too
stiff.

A word, also, for the set, which
admirably lent the light, space, and
air required for the proceedings.

One of these examinations, to dis-
cover what stages of advancement the
subjects have reached in general edu-
cation and fields of knowledge, was
given yesterday.

Ralph W. Gerard, Professor of
Physiology, who is chairman of the
committee, declares, “Only a limited
number of students can be in the test
at this time. Those who are asked to
participate are representative of stu-
dent types in the College. And,” he
adds, “They should make an effort to
participate, for it will prove valuable
both to the college and to the stu-
dents.”

Text of President
Hutchins’ V-E

Day Address

This is a day of thanksgiving and prayer, thanks that we have
been delivered from the bloodiest war in history, thanks to tho°e
brave men, living and dead, who have been the means of our de-
liverance; and prayer that we may show humility, humanity, in-
telligence, and charity in using the victory they have won for us.

It is unnecessary to say that it is our duty to remain firm to the end.
And this means something more, and something more difficult, than merely
persisting till the defeat of Japan. All those regulations which have been
necessary to maintain the economy, to supply the troops, and to prevent im-
poverishment will now be doubly irksome. They will be doubly necessary.
We can only imagine the devastation that has been wrought in Europe. For
the first time in modern history whole cities, even whole provinces, have
ceased to exist.

We come now to the real test of our professed ideals, for the sake of
which we claimed to enter the war. We did so, we said, not to save our own
skins, but to make possible a peaceful, just, human society, which should
embrace all the peoples of the earth. If that is what we want, we must now
sacrifice, not our lives, but our goods to save millions of our fellow-men from
starvation and from the moral and political disintegration which starvation
will carry with it. There are already some indications that we shall be less
wiling to sacrifice our goods than we have been our lives, or at least the lives
of our soldiers and sailors.

"Can't Indict Whole People . . . . "

Educated people now come to the test of their education. Every educated
person knows enough about human nature to know that war is brutalizing
and that propaganda should be received with skepticism. In Napoleon’s time
it was generally agreed, but fortunately not by those in power, that the
French were a guilty race who ought to be exterminated. The slogan “Hang
the Kaiser” seems ridiculous to us now. I venture to predict that the present
excitement about war criminals will seem ridiculous a few years hence. At
this juncture we can afford to remember what Edmund Burke said of us: “I
do not know the method of drawing up an indictment against a whole people.”

We cannot support the thesis that because German leaders acted illegally,
therefore they^should be treated illegally. Two wrongs do not make a right.
It is easy to understand why Mussolini was lynched; it is more difficult to
see why Americans should gloat over it. We should remember that one of
the points which Job urged in his own favor when seeking relief from his
own misfortunes was that he did not rejoice when his enemy fell.

We are now on the verge of forgetting history, to say nothing of Ed-
mund Burke and Job, and forgetting common sense as well, for common
sense tells us that if we do not intend to kill off all the Germans and Japanese
in the world, and if we do not intend to rule them as slaves by military force
till the end of time, we must treat them with justice, and, if possible, with
mercy. Otherwise we lay here and now the foundations of the next war. To
feed German citizens one-third of what the American soldier gets, to reduce
Germany, in short, to a subsistence level; to make Germany a pastoral coun-
try; to split Germany into little states, so as to base the next war on its in-
evitable desire to unite—all this is unhistorical and senseless enough. When
we think of the dreadful poverty which Germany must undergo, even with
the best of treatment, in the years ahead, and when we reflect on the political
consequences to us of that poverty, we should see that it is in our own inter-
est to do everything we can to mitigate its effects.

Pleads for Justice and Mercy

The most distressing aspect of present discussions of the future of Ger-
many and Japan is the glee with which the most inhuman proposals are
brought forward and the evident pleasure with which they are received by
our fellow-citizens. The general maxim of the educated person should be
judge not that ye be not judged.

The peace of the world depends upon the restoration of the German and
Japanese people. The wildest atrocity stories cannot alter the simple truths
that all men are human, that no men are beasts, that all men are the children
of God, that no men are irrevocably damned by God, and that all men are by
nature members of the human community. These truths must dictate our
attitude toward and decisions about the German and Japanese people. The
misbehavior of an individual man, resulting from miseducation, misdirection,
or stress of circumstances does not permit us to forget that he is a man or
to treat him as a brute or to act like brutes ourselves. If we are going to
have one good world, the Germans and the Japanese must somehow be incor-
porated into it. The basis of such incorporation must be justice and mercy.

The educated person is under a duty not to forget his education in facing
the issue of world organization. The educated person knows that it is impos-
sible to have world organization without paying for it. He will decide ths
question, not by harboring the hallucination that he can have it without pay-
ing for it, but by asking whether the kind of organization he is likely to get
is worth the price he will have to pay. If the organization is likely to pro-
mote war, he will rightly decide that it is worthless, and that he will stay out
of it if he can. If the organization is likely to promote peace, he should be
willing to give up something in order to get the organization going. Once
more, if he will not give up anything and yet insists that he wants peace
through world organization he is a fool. The law of contradiction tells us
that you cannot at one and the same time join a world organization and stay
out of it. You cannot have all of the advantages of membership in a world
organization and none of the disadvantages. You cannot have ali the at-
tributes of sovereignty and give up some of them.

You cannot have a world organization and decline to have the world or-
ganized. In particular, you cannot have the world organized and insist that
your country will remain unorganized. You can’t, for example, have an ef-

difficult

instrument to play in tune in such
compositions and the players did well
enough. But in spite of their efforts
the three pieces suggested Gen. Booth
entering into heaven. Perhaps the
brightest spot of the evening was the
Haydn “Surprise” Symphony. The
andante was delivered with authority
and precision. The menuetto with
its strong accents of the dance was
exploited to the fullest. Here the
orchestra displayed a depth of tonal
color and sweetness of intonation that
was surprisingly good.

fective world court, if you are going to insist that the court can’t judge your
country without its consent. You can’t have an effective world organization
if the organization can act only when it is unanimous. This reduces world
organization to a delusion and a snare; it looks like world organization; it
misleads people into thinking that they can rely on the world organization,
when actually the world is as disorganized as ever.

Sees Need For Equality In New League

Equally pernicious is the doctrine that all right Ties with the big powers
and that their security and spheres of influence are the primary concern of
the world. This is the surest foundation for the next war. If justice and law
are the cement of society, they are the cement of any world society. We can-
not pretend to have a world society unless all the members of it are equally
subject to law and unless the society is founded on justice, not to our allies
alone, but also to our defeated enemies.

An unjust peace and an unjust world organization make the next war
inevitable and make it likely that the next war will be unjust. The sense of
injustice is the best excuse for fighting, and an unjust world organization
commits the members in advance to fight unjust wars.

In the name, then, of those who have fought and died for us, let us pray
and let us work that those powers which make men human may prevail over
those which relate them to the beasts. In the hour of victory let us remem-
ber that vengeance is the Lord’s. With full recognition of the dangers and
the difficulties, but with confidence and resolution, let us struggle forward
toward the ultimate creation of the great community.

Five months ago, this newspaper addressed an open letter
to the Board of Trustees urging prompt action. There has been
no indication from the Board that it has even given the most
crying needs of the College a single word of consideration. It is
to be hoped that they are not blind to the problem. They have
committed themselves to a successful College. Such a college
has demanded prompt, clearcut, forthright action in the past.
It will demand the same in the future.

MAROON NETMEN SURGE TO 6th WIN

Strong College Cinder Team To
Participate In State Contest

The College track team journeys to Kankakee tonight to
participate in the Illinois State high school qualifying meet.

Individual winners of first and sec-
ond places, and all competing mem-
bers of the winning team in tonight’s
meet will qualify for the state meet
to be held next Friday and Saturday.
Tonight the Senior boys will meet the
same Thornton team that they bowed
to in a triangular meet earlier in the
year, in addition to Bloom, Argo, Kan-
kakee, Lockport, and other southern
Cook County schools. The College’s
hopes rest largely on four men: Dave
Hall, Captain Bob Collins, Chuck
Ferris, and Brenton Steams. In to-
night’s 440 Hall will meet some of
the same runners that pushed him
to his best outdoor time of :53.6. The
quality of competition may well push
pole vaulter Churck Ferris up to and
past his indoor mark of 10' 10", and
half-miler Brenton Stears will be
pushed all the way in his favorite
event. In addition to these, Chicago
will have two men in every event and
will run in the half mile relay.

The senior team, minus several of
its outstanding performers who had
competed the night before in the Pro-
viso Relays, bowed to Concordia High
last Saturday morning. Chicago’s
profusion of second and third places
could not make up for the lack of
winning performances, and in the final
accounting, Derr’s men were 8%
points behind.

The juniors, on the other hand,
easily polished off the Concordia boys,
77 to 18. Led by their high-scoring
captain, Bob Linsicome, who picked
up 38% points, the juniors won every
event except the pole vault and the
discus. Other winners besides Lin-
sicome included Charley Forck in the
660 and Dave Br'oder in the high
jump.

Up against strong competition at
the Proviso Relays, the Seniors came
out with % of a point garnered by
Dave Weaver’s tie for fifth place in
the high jump.

This Tuesday afternoon at 4:00,
Stagg Field will be the scene of the
closing meet of the year. All mem-
bers of the Private School League will
compete in the senior division only
with Chicago being a strong favorite
to win.

Queens at Tuesday’s meet will be
Irene Lyons, Jean Cranston, and Bar-
bara Parks. The trio were named
by the entire track squad.

QUADS NIP GREEN HALL

In the only intramural softball
game of the week in the girls league,
the Quadranglers defeated Green
Hall, 16 to 14, last Tuesday. All other
games were cancelled because of
weather conditions.

Maroons Lose
Again, 12 to 2
Mix With Western Michigan
On Midway Diamond Today

Chicago faces Western Michigan
Friday at 2:30 on the Midway field
in their ninth baseball venture of the
current season. The Maroons met
Michigan earlier in the season and
were defeated 13 to 3. Since that
game, the University has won a
single game in eight starts.

Working behind the three hit pitch-
ing of Reuben Stohs, Concordia
avenged its earlier defeat at the hands
of the University of Chicago by
swamping the Maroons, 12 to 2. Chi-
cago pitchers were nicked for 14 hits
while the infield maintained a fairly
steady footing and allowed few errors.

Concordia got off to an early four-
run lead in the fourth inning while
Chicago was unable to punch a man
across home plate until the fifth.
Both Maroon runs were scored by
clever third baseman George Steele
who got on base both times by walks.
Steele was then able to work around
to third by some clever baserunning
and he was finally able to score by
dint of his running efforts alone.

Last Saturday, Chicago dropped its
closest game of the year to Wheaton,
6 to 5. The game went ten innings
and the University infield played one
of the tightest games yet.

That year, I860, civil war was looming on the country’s

Team Is Still Unbeaten
After Match With N. U.

The University tennis squad kept its record
spotles again this week with dual victories, a
smashing triumph over Illinois Tech and a
squeeze-win over Northwestern.

By virtue of the victories, Chicago boosted
its victory string to six straight.

Illinois Tech was conquered 6-1, while North-
western fell by the slim margin of one set, 5 to 4,
Wednesday on the Wildcat courts. The Maroons
defeated both teams earlier in the season.

Norgren’s men are now aiming for the Big
Ten .Conference meet to be held at Evanston,
May 26, with only one other meet, with Iowa
State Saturday, scheduled before the season’s
close. Michigan is a strong pre-meet contender
for the title, with Illinois and Minnesota also
strong challengers.

Tech scored its only point of the matches
when Dave Afton, V-12 student, downed Phil
Glotzer, 8-6 and 6-3. Harry Tully, Chicago’s
number two man, kept his personal record clean
with a little trouble against Mike Vogt in three
sets, 8-6, 5-7 and 6-1. The University swept the
doubles matches.

Northwestern gave the Maroons a lot of
trouble in splitting the singles matches but Nor-
gren’s men came back to take two of the three
doublesgames to win the meet, 5 to 4.

UC Shares 1st
In 3-Way Meet

The University track team see-
sawed through the Milwaukee and
Elmhurst three-way meet Saturday
to a first place tie with Milwaukee
State Teachers College. Both win-
ning teams had 65% points apiece,
while Elmhurst came through with
32 points.

SINGLES

White, Northwestern, beat Glotzer, Chicago,
7-5, 6-0; Tully, Chicago, beat Ryan North-
western, 6-2, 6-1; Shapiro, Chicago, beat Neth-
ercott. Northwestern, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1; Roth,
Northwestern, beat Greenburg, Chicago, 6-4,
6-4; Kasbeer, Northwestern, beat Matthews,
Chicago, 6-2, 6-4; Grayston, Chicago, beat
Chalberg, Northwestern, 6-2, 6-0.

DOUBLES

Glotzer and Tully, Chicago, beat White and
Ryan, Northwestern, 9-7, 6-2 ; Nethercott and
Roth, Northwestern, beat Shapiro and Green-
burg, Chicago, 6-3, 7-5; Matthews and Grays-
ton, Chicago, beat Kasbeer and Chalberg,
Northwestern, 9-7, 6-2.

Merriam’s 11 man team was paced
by Dinckleocker, Suits, Russell, and
Bokman. Lagging by 15 points at
the three-quarter mark, the Maroons
broke through in a sudden spurt when
Captain Paul Russell topped both the
low hurdles and the high hurdles;
Dinckleocker came out first in the
broad jump, the 100’s, and the 220’s;
and Thad Suits put the javalin 139.5
feet into the cinders to win the first
place also.
