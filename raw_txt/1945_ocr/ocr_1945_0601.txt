An eight-day program highlighting award of citations to 33
distinguished graduates and including an address by President

10 Easy Lessons
In Japanese

The country’s first college-credit
correspondence course in Japanese
will be offered by the Home Study
Department beginning June 11. The
syllabus, including detailed directions
for learning Japanese script, has al-
ready been completed, and sets of
phonograph records, for use in learn-
ing to speak the language, are now
being prepared.

The course has been written by
Leeds Gulick, Professor of Japanese,
and James T. Nishimura, who have
been teaching Japanese to ASTP men
here for more than a year. Full cred-
it will be given to those who master
*he script, but others may take the
►ourse without credit.

Clem Thompson, Assistant Director
f Home Study, predicts that the
jurse will be of interest to military
personnel being shipped from the
European theater to the Pacific and
to those interested in trade and cul-
tural relations with the East. Mem-
bers of the armed forces studying
through the Armed Forces Institute
yill pay only half tuition.

Home Study is also offering col-
lege courses in braille with courses
in English—the first subject to be
offered blind students. The Univer-
sity is cooperating with the Hadley
Correspondence School for the Blind
of Winnetka, Ill. in the project.

Four Lectures

Four lectures dealing with post-
war problems in social service are

School of Social Service Administra-
tion. Tonight, Martha Branscombe,

United Nations Relief and Rehabili-
tation Association, will speak on
“Child Welfare in Post-War Europe.”

Next Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs-

the Social Services in a Full Employ-
ment Economy,” “Financing of So-
cial Security,” and “Administration
of Social Security.” Mrs. Burns is
the former head of the Economic
Security and Health Section of the
National Resources Planning Board.

All lectures will be given in Grad-
uate Education 126 at 8:00 p.m.

Parties for G. I.’s
Will Continue Here

Weekly parties for the military
personnel on the Quadrangles spon-
sored by the Midway Service Organi-
zation will be continued, that group
has announced. The parties, open to
both men and women, are held on
the third floor of Ida Noyes Hall
every Sunday evening from five to
nine.

Informality is the keynote with mu-
sic for dancing provided, but no formal
program arranged.

Seven conferences and institutes, ranging from rural educa-
tion to the responsibilities of higher teaching, will highlight the
Summer Quarter of the Department of^Education.

The twenty-third annual institute for administrators of higher
institutions will be held July 5 and 6, with the central theme of
“Emergent Responsibilities in Higher Education?’ Among the
speakers to appear on the program are Dean J. C. Peatman of
the City College of New York, Dean T. Raymond McConnell of
the University of Minnesota, Vice-president Earl J. McGrath of
Buffalo University, and Professors Ralph Tyler and Robert Red-
field, of Chicago.

One half-day session will be de-
voted to each of the following topics:
“The Extension of Responsibilities
for Counseling and Guidance,” “Com-
munity Relationships and Responsi-
bilities,” “Reorganization of Upper-
Division Curricula,” and “Faculty
Participation in Institutional Govern-
ment.” The latter will be of especial
interest to Chicago faculty members
because of the recent reorganization
of the administration here.

Other conferences scheduled will
deal with developments in American
secondary education, guidance and
personnel work, education in rural
communities, social science teaching
in high schools and junior colleges,
and the implications for education of
knowledge concerning human devel-
opment.

All conferences will be held in ac-
cordance with government travel re-
strictions, and will therefore be pri-
marily for students and faculty mem-
bers at the University and educators
residing in the Chicago area.

Chicago Is Also Ran
In Big Ten Tourney

The Maroon netmen wound
up their 1945 season last Satur-
day at Evanston by placing
fifth among nine entries in the
Western Coference title meet.
Chicago had won eight out of
nine meets prior to the tourna-
ment.

Michigan’s defending champions
had little trouble in gaining the title
although they obtained only one first
place. However, the Wolverines
placed four men in the singles finals
and two in the doubles finals to roll
up their 18 point total.

By winning three first round
singles matches and two first round
doubles matches Chicago managed to
pile up five points although none of
the Maroons entered the finals. Phil
Glotzer scored a point in the number
one division by whipping Dave White
of Northwestern 8-6, 6-3. Unluckily
Phil met Aris Franklin of Ohio State
in the second round and dropped his

College Net Team

Victorious in all meets and de-
feated in only three individual
matches, the courtmen of the col-
lege went on to tie with Wheaton

ard Kalkofen of Purdue 8-6, 6-3.
Chicago gained its third and last
singles point when Alden Matthews
playing in the fifth division defeated
Bob Sang of Northwestern 7-5, 6-3.

In the doubles Glotzer and Tully
teamed up to down Ercument Kara-
can and Jack Clatfelter of Illinois
6-1, 7-5. Matthews and Tom Gray-
son provided the Maroon’s final point
as they defeated John Yenesaker and
Ed Ishii of Minnesota 7-5, 7-5 in the
third division.

In the number one spot, Dave
Hacker won the singles while Phil
Arnsfield and Maynard Lewis went
to the semi’s in the doubles match-
es. The only defeat came to two
spot man, Larry Olen.

In the last game of the season,
the netmen swarmed through
Frances Parker at the Field House
on Thursday for a 4-0 triumph.
With this, Coach Aaron’s racket-
eers rocked their final record to
six wins, over Harvard, Morgan

Big 10 Track

Illinois shattered Michigan’s two
year reign of the Big Ten outdoor
track title last Saturday at Memorial
Stadium in Champaign. Illini won
seven individual championships and
piled up a total of 65^ points to beat
out the Wolverines by 11- points.

This year it was the Illini’s turn
to show astounding team balance as
they scored in 12 of the 14 events.
Star of the meet was George Walker,
freshman from Robbins, who ran
away with the three first places. The
slim Negro won the 100-yard dash,
the 120-yard high hurdles, and the
220-yard low hurdles to add 15
points to his team’s total. Bob Kelly
who won the 440-yard dash and the
880-yard run, Maree Gonzalez who
placed fourth in the 440 and won the
220-yard dash, and Henry Aihara
who tied for fourth in the high jump

were the other big men to aid

since 1934.

Editorial

End The Student Activity Muddle Now

My dear Dean Kimpton:

We have read with the deepest interest your
recent memorandum in regard to student activi-
ties and your more recent disclosure that Lt.
Col. Alan L. Chidsey, currently of the United
States army, has been appointed assistant dean
of students in charge of student activities. The
administration is now conclusively committed,
as a result of that memorandum, to the recog-
nition that an extra-curricular program is not
only highly desirable but constitutes an essen-
tial part of a University program.

You will forgive us for being frank, but we
cannot paint too dreary a picture of the current
state of activities on the Quadrangles. They
have fallen into a complete state of disrepute,
bewilderment, and confusion. The ill-guided and
ill-conceived University policy of non-support
has led to the most tragic muddle in the history
of the University extra curricular program.

Alan Chidsey will confront a Herculean task.
He will find campus dramatics in the doldrums.
He will discover that music activities are badly
snarled. He will learn that University publica-
tions, in desperate need of facilities; are one step
from complete collapse. His investigations and
surveys will unearth the fact that campus ath-
letics are in a turmoil. He will find campus polit-
ical organizations, eager to increase their pro-
grams, shackled by lack of appropriate aid and
guidance.

It should be clearly evident that nothing less
than complete reversal of the policy of mere ver-
bal support will suffice. It is not enough to rec-
ognize the desirability of student activities. It
is not sufficient to extend them mere lip service.
Such hypocrisy befogs the issue and fails to rec-
ognize that it is only financial aid, facilities, end
highly skilled guidance which can pump life in-
to a virtually defunct student activity program.
It should be acknowledged that an emergency
situation exists and that the proper stimulants
must be administered.

We must further recognize that while such
material aid is absolutely imperative, it is in it-

In an editorial on the future of
education, the Hamline Oracle takes
favorable notice of recommendations
for the establishment of “core curri-
cula” which will remedy the evils of
the free elective system—policies
long since put into effect at Chicago.
The complete editorial follows:

“The impact of the service train-
ing programs upon the old divisions
of studies with their frequent lack
of specific objectives and the urge
to adapt the courses of study to the
needs of returning veterans are bring-
ing about plans for modifying col-
lege curricula of tomorrow. Ap-
parently the shortcomings of higher
eduaction have now been generally
recognized, and most colleges have
determined to correct their errors be-
fore that type of education falls into
disrepute.

“The most striking recommenda-
tion of a number of the special com-
mittee reports about new courses of
study has to do with what is known
as the ‘core of liberal education’.
Students in the first two years of
college, regardless of their plans for
later specialization, will be expected
to pursue certain studies that make
up this core. The new plan, of course,
is not much different from that pro-
posed and put into effect several

self not sufficient. Student initiative and leader-
ship must walk hand in hand with a vigorous ad-
ministration policy.

It is our hope, sir, that you will empower Col-
onel Chidsey to make the sweeping and far
reaching revisions which are so vital; that you
will permit him to guarantee active University
support of student life; and that the administra-
tion’s half-hearted, drifting, double-talk policies
are at an end, to be replaced by decisive, clear-
cut, definite proposals. The students of this Uni-
versity should tolerate nothing less.

The responsibility is now yours. It cannot be
evaded. You must face it head on. Attempt to
escape it, and the University extra-curricular
program will drift even further into its morass
of despair, giving way finally to complete disin-
tegration and chaos.

We appeal to you, sir, for prompt and imme-
diate action. We urge that you wholeheartedly
endorse a program of University support for stu-
dent activities and that you recognize the ines-
capable.

‘THEY’RE GIVING THE BI SCI COMP IN THERE”

Welcome Alumni

University officialdom brushes off the wel-
come mat and unfurls its homecoming banners
next week. Sovereigns of the Quadrangles for
eight-action packed days will be alumni of 53-
years of University activity.

Few traditions still survive on the Quad-
rangles, but there are fewer more colorful than
the round of activities offered at the annual clam-
bake of graduates. The C-banquet, the Univer-
sity sing, and the President’s report to the
alumni are traditions that have lived through
the years.

While the war will undoubtedly handicap this
year’s program, alumni officials have worked
tirelessly to arrange an attractive program.
Their agenda literally bristles with highlights.

Shake the dust from your feet, Mr. Graduate!
You’re home again.

Here and There

Hamline University Embraces
Doctrine of 'Liberal Education9

The gospel of “Education for Freedom” seems to be spread-
ing, according to reports from Hamline University, St. Paul,
received via Associated Collegiate Press.

years ago by a few of the pioneering
universities. For years, in fact, some
colleges have been trying to correct
the faults of the free elective system
and have insisted that every candi-
date for an A.B. degree have some
contact with all the main areas of
knowledge.

“The impetus given to scientific
studies, including mathematics, by the
service programs certainly proves the
desirability of putting some course
in natural science into our plans for
a more liberal education. Likewise,
the experience with language teach-
ing in wartime should teach us many
things about the learning of lan-
guages and the clear need of such
knowledge in the world of today. If
there is an intensified interest re-
cently in the social sciences, it is
easily understood. We are living in
‘one world’; we are therefore required
to know the history of other peoples,
their geography and politics.

“Certain it is that such demands
cannot be met by mere external
changes. The reorganization of
college education, if it is to be worthy
of the name, must go further than a
reshuffling of subject matter. It
must include a new conception of the
end and aim of higher education.

Clark Kessler Claims:

‘You Can’t Appreciate Good Music
While Ignorant Of Its Techniques’

By SAMUEL GOLDEN

We depart slightly from our practice, in the last three arti-
cles, of interviewing faculty members about music appreciation.
Our fourth expert, Clark Kessler, while not a member of the fac-
ulty, is employed by the Music Department as assistant conductor
of the campus orchestra, wind coach, and director of several in-
formal chamber groups. Skilled as performer, composer, and di-
rector, he quite naturally takes an avid interest in our problem.

“The greatest fascination music has
for me is in discovering just what
has gone into the composing of a
work. As I see it, most listeners miss
catching the beauties of music by re-
lying on it to affect them emotion-
ally, without actually know-
’ng what it is that makes

. it music.” Mr. Kessler does
not deny music’s ultimate

A emotional appeal, but he as-
Series serts that any criticism (in
the sense in which every
listener making judgments is a critic)
which rests solely on how a composi-
tion affects the ear, rather than on
knowledge of its structure, cannot
hope to give a real understanding
and appreciation of its excellence.

“Unfortunately, in the teaching of
music appreciation emphasis is placed
on explanations of the descriptive as-
pects, or at best on accounts of com-
posers’ lives, and true technical knowl-
edge is sacrificed. A prevalence of
ignorant listeners, music critics, and
even performers, results. Performers
too often play up the emotional as-
pects of the music in order to stir the
feelings of the audience at the expense
of music comprehension.”

In response to a question, Mr. Kess-
ler declared that skill in performance
is not necessary for a knowledge of
music. A good course in composition
and some acquaintance with musical
theory should enable the listener to
appreciate the construction of musical
forms. “Many people who claim not
to like Mozart or Tschaikovsky have
only their own ignorance to blame.

If they properly understood the mu-
sic’s structure, they could not help
being moved.”

In discussing the merits of Mozart
and Tschaikovsky, Mr. Kessler takes
issue with the opinion of Joseph
Schwab, as expressed in this series
some weeks ago. Schwab claims a
superiority for Mozart on the basis
of purity of form. Kessler observes,
on the other hand, that very often
the structure in Tschaikovsky shows
more studied plan than that of Mo-
zart. The more obvious distinction
between the two composers is a dif-
ference in kind of organization, rath-
er in degree.

Good music, according to Kessler’s
criteria, can be determined quite
readily by the instructed listener. “If
music is stupid,” he says, “it can be
judged so immediately by one skilled
in the technique of music. He may
be stirred emotionally by it, but he
can predict the lastingness of the im-
pression by its degree of structural
excellence.”

Bemelman's
New Satire
Scores Hit

Ludwig Bemelmans, The Blue Dan-
ube.

Ludwig Bemelman’s little satire on
the Nazi occupation of Austria is a
fairy-tale sort of thing about a fam-
ily who live on an island in the Dan-
ube and raise huge beer radishes.

The fact that the island officially
doesn’t even exist gives old Anton,
his two spinster sisters, and his niece
something of an advantage over the
Nazis. The conclusion isn’t very
satisfactory for a fairy tale, un-
fortunately, but on the whole it’s an
amusing little book.

The water-color illustrations are
wonderful, and although this volume
doesn’t quite come up to the quality
of Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep, we
think you’ll like the radish people.

♦ ♦ ♦

Adria Locke Langley, A Lion Is in
the Streets.

A Lion Is in the Streets is mainly
notabje for it’s excessive use of dia-
lect—some of it so obscure that it
slows up the reading, but most of it
merely irritating.

It’s the story of Hank Martin, a
Southern demagogue of the Huey
Long type, and his rise to power. It
could have been a thrilling story but
it isn’t, because there is a weakness
in the man himself, and a reflected
weakness in his wife, Verity, whom
the author apparently intended to be
the moderating factor. It’s a little
hard to warm up to a hero who is
characterized by a shallow vanity and
a “gift of gab” and a heroine whose
only reaction seems to be resignation.

The progress of the plot in this
kind of a story is always interesting,
but the characters are not good, the
narration is flat, and there are far too
many “you-alls.”

Film Group's Summer
Season Opens June 19

Documentary Film Group activities
for the Summer Quarter will be con-
tinued with the presentation of
weekly documentary and fiction films
to begin on June 19 with “Catherine
the Great.” Other programs in the
series, in order of showing, include
“Psychiatry in Action”; “Mayer-
ling”; “Feebleminded”; “Moonlight
Sonata”; “World of Plenty”; “Chil-
den of the City,” and “Back to Nor-
mal”; “Combat Fatigue”; and the
group’s own production “Opus No. 1.”

In addition to the regular program,
the group will also offer a series of
four film classics beginning June 22.
The list consists of “Covered Wagon,”
directed by James Cruze; “The Birth
of a Nation,” directed by David Grif-
fith; “All Quiet on the Western
Front”; and Sternberg’s “Under-
world.” Admission to the special
series will be by series ticket only.

sented every Tuesday at 8 p.m. in
Social Science 122. The four classics
are scheduled for alternate Fridays,
also at 8 p.m. in Social Science 122.

Comp Asides

Most comprehensives are puzzling to the student, but probably
the most confusing was the art comp. It seems t^at the second
section was to be on modern art; the students glanced at the first
page and saw several pictures that looked just like diagrams.
They sighed and got to work analyzing the pictures. After a half
hour some brilliant soul discovered that they were diligently dis-
cussing graphs and the like—somehow the physics comp had
been given them by mistake. We never did find out what the
physics students thought of the art comp.

Mike Clark is home on furlough. The Windemere will be the scene of the

stamped, and posted them all over campus. Unfortunately, the posters
weren’t quite so innocuous as they seemed at first glance. In big bold letters
the placards announced a Sigma Chi open party at Ida Noyes after Inter-
Fraternity Sing to celebrate the Sweetheart Contest. To cap this off, there
was an additional line advising all women to call Stan Hart at Judson for
their dates. The irate Sigs marched over to the Information Office and
delivered a stinging rebuke which is still keeping the office in a rosy state.

Signs of the Times?

One night last week a red candle was burning in the window of a
darkened room at Beecher and the mournful occupant was singing, “!O
Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight?”—we are happy to report that ten
minutes later her sailor man showed up. Casper Milquetoast, in civilian
attire, reversed his usual role the other night. A very efficient major and
captain were out in front of Beecher working madly to open their car
(efficiently, they had left the keys inside) with various implements, among
them coat hangers donated by Beecher residents. They struggled un-
successfully until a very meek, weak little man came up and jimmied open
the door—with a crowbar.

More Comp Notes

We have learned that the esteemed Frederick I. Gottesman was ill last
week__that, not lack of study, was his reason for not taking the history
comp. The proctor at the English comp was a witty soul and throughout
the exam he wisecracked. His closing remark was, “Please return all the
pencils. You see, they’re University property—and [coyly] we wouldn’t
want to raise your tuition.” As usual the Oil was extremely tough—and we
hear that the only thing that bolstered up the sufferers was the militant
“Onward Christian Soldiers” played on the Mitchell Tower chimes.

This and That

Phi Sigs will hold a house party after IF sing—alums will attend.
Monday night all the fraternities serenaded the girls’ dorms. (Kelly sang
back.) Two of our friends were following a B & G man on his rounds one
night, as he passed a certain well-used clump of bushes, he solemnly said,
“We never look there.” Tricia and Tony are engaged—she’s Murphy, he’s
Navy med.

witk Ike OHO HIM

As photogenic as any of the beautiful gal doctors
you see in reel life is this prospective one from
real life . . . our beauty-of-the-week, College-1
student Irene Lyons. Never guess, from
her picture, she had such serious plans . . .

'though you might guess (and you'd be right!) that she

sports and the out-of-doors. Ask her, sometime, about her
60-mile bike trips, her upside-down life in a
sailboat, her skill as a cowhand!

What kind of clothes does Irene like? Well, naturally,
the kind that fit her life ^ . . easy, sturdy, ready for lots of
action . . . like the seersucker sunsuit she’s wearing here!
"Just the thing,” said she when she spied it in the
Sports Room at Marshall Field & Company. "That’s for me!”

Think you’d like it for your own? Besides being so pretty,
it has lots of other advantages .. . washes like a hanky,
needs but a minimum of ironing, is about the coolest
thing you could own. Red, brown or green, striped in white
. . . sizes 12 to 18. Boy shorts, $2.95. Midriff top, $2.95.
In the Sports Room—Sixth Floor, Middle, Wabash!

Meet the Beet People. Every week, on this page,
the Chicago Maroon will introduce you to another
University of Chicago glamor girl ... a winning campus
personality. And every week you’ll see her in an
attractive costume she’s chosen at Marshall Field & Company.
