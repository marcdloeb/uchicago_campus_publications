Doc Films
Inaugurates
New Series

The Documentary Film Group will
open its Winter Quarter series this
Tuesday everting at 8:00 p.m. in So-
cial Science 122 with the presentation
of two films about Mexico, the techni-
color “Mexican Moods” and “Time in
the Sun.”

“Mexican Moods,” produced by the
United States Office of Inter-American
Affairs, is a many-faceted picture. It
presents ancient sacrificial rites re-
enacted atop a Mayan temple, but it
also shows Mexico’s most famous
movie comedian in a characteristic
predicament. The music, color, and
mood so much a part of the Mexican
are vividly depicted.

“Time in the Sun” is a more serious
film, dealing with an abortive peon
revolt. The film was directed by Ser-
gei Eisenstein, one of Russia’s most
famous directors, and has been publi-
cized as representative of his best
work.

The documentary series will be pre-
sented on alternate Tuesday evenings
throughout the quarter, and will in-
clude the following programs, in addi-
tion to the one scheduled for January
9: January 23, “Conquests of th^
Air” and Walt Disney’s “South of the
Border;” February 6, “China’s Four
Hundred Million;” February 20, a
program of films depicting current
social and political problems; March
6, a program of contemporary war
documentaries, including “Road to
Paris,” “Battle of the Marianas,” and
“Air Operations,” the latter a digest
of the Royal Air Force film “Target
for Tonight.”

The Documentary Film Group will
also sponsor a series of fiction films,
titles of which are to be announced
shortly, which will alternate with the
documentary programs.

Concert to Feature
French Compositions

The third of the Department of
Music’s Chamber Concerts will take
place on January 12, Friday, in Man-
del Hall at 8:30 p.m. The bulk of the
program will be devoted to works of
French composers. Janet Fairbanks,
soprano; Dorothy Lane, harpsichord-
ist; Rudolph Reuter, pianist; and
Harvey Noack and Emil Eck, flutists;
will be featured.

The program will open with Bach’s
Concerto in F for harpsichord, two
flutes, and string orchestra. Then
will be given the first Chicago per-
formance of Rameau’s cantata, The
Faithful Shepherd (Le Berger Fidele),
for soprano, strings, and harpsichord
continue.

Two other vocal works will be in-
cluded in the program: Ernest Chaus-
son’s Chanson Perpetuelle for soprano,
string quartet, and piano; and Ravel’s
Chansons Madecasses (Madagascar
Songs) for soprano, flute, violoncello
and piano. The program will con-
clude with the Piano Quintet No. 2 in
C Minor, Op. 115, of Gabriel Faure,
played in recognition of the centenary
of the composer’s birth.

The Department of Music has an-
nounced that the performance of Mil-
haud’s opera Les Malheurs d’Orphee
(“The Woes of Orpheus”), originally
scheduled for the February program,
has been postponed until April.

Faculty Views On
Radio Activities
Sought by Hutchins

In order to get all shades of faculty
opinion on the University’s radio ac-
tivities, President Hutchins recently
issued an invitation to all faculty
members to report their views on the
subject. They may report either to
him or to a newly-formed Advisory
Committee on Radio. Members of the
committee include: Ralph A. Beals,
chairman, William Benton, Herbert
Blumer, Leon Carnovsky, Virgil E.
Herrick, Dr. K. Eileen Hite, Cyril I.
Houle, 0. J. Matthijs Jolies, Jerome G.
Kerwin, Everett C. Olson, and Theo-
dore W. Schultz.

The duty of this committee will be
to consider any questions concerning
the educational issues involved in
broadcasting with a view to recom-
mending a statement of policy to the
President.

The University has produced radio
programs continuously since 1922, and
for the last eleven years the pro-
grams have been carried on national
networks. Two of these are The Hu-
man Adventure and The University
of Chicago Round Table.

Ida Council Sponsors
All-Campus Open House

The first all-campus party of 1945
is an open house at Ida Noyes on Jan-
uary 5. Bowling, roller skating, table
tennis, and swimming will begin at
7:30 p.m. Those hardy souls partici-
pating in these strenuous activities
will terminate them at 10:00 p.m.—if
they have not already succumbed. For
the more lethargic types, there will be
bridge, chess, and dancing to Wally
Hermes’ five piece orchestra from 8:30
till 11:00 p.m. Altogether, its a won-
derful opportunity for a reunion with
all and sundry before being buried in
the quarter’s work.

The Ida Noyes Council is sponsoring
the party, and members of the organ-
ization will be the hostesses. There
is absolutely no admission charge. Ev-
eryone on campus is invited.

Due to circumstances beyond our
control, the Marshall Field and
Company advertisement scheduled
for this week will not appear. A
new series, featuring dormitory
glamour girls, will be inaugurated
with next week’s issue.

with University

John Fryer Moulds, Secretary of the
Board of Trustees of the University,
retired December 31 after 41 years
of service with the University. Moulds,
appointed secretary of the board 17
years ago, served the University under
all its five presidents.

Wilbur C. Munnecke, vice-president
of the University, has been named to
succeed Moulds as secretary. He will
also continue to fulfill his duties as
vice-president.

Moulds took his first job with the
University in 1904, three years before
his graduation, and with the exception
of a two-year interruption, has served
ever since. Among the positions he
has held are: cashier; alumni secre-
tary; assistant secretary of the board
of trustees; executive officer, football
tickets committee; assistant business
manager; secretary, board of trustees,
Country Home for Convalescent Chil-
dren; and secretary, board of trustees,
Rush Medical College.

Moulds is secretary of the board
of the Baptist Theological Union and
vice-president of the board of trustees
of the Frances Shimer Junior College,
Mt. Carroll, Illinois.

Munnecke was appointed vice-pres-
ident of the University last February
while serving as an adviser on war
contracts. He was formerly a vice-
president of Marshall Field and Com-
pany.

Public Course On
Near East Retained
In Scheduled Series

One of the two public courses in
the division of the humanities, sched-
uled during the winter quarter, will
be cancelled because of the illness of
Tom P. Cross, Professor of English
and comparative literature.

Professor Cross was to have pre-
sented a series on “The Foundations
of Irish Culture” at 7:30 p.m. on
Mondays, January 8 through March
12. This series will not be presented,
and no other series has been scheduled
in its place.

However, the series, “Speculative
Thought in the Ancient Near East,”
given by members of the department
of oriental languages and literatures,
will begin as announced on Wednes-
day at 7:30 p.m. in room 122 of the
Social Science building.

Included in the list of speakers on
the series are: John A. Wilson, Di-
rector of the Oriental Institute; Henri
Frankfort, Research Professor of Or-
iental Archeology; Thorkild Jacobsen,
Associate Professor of Social Institu-
tions; and William A. Irwin, Professor

ature in the Federated Theological
Faculty of the University.

Next Ida Feature
Rollerskating Carnival

Winter Quarter activities at Ida
Noyes will begin with a roller-skating
carnival on Friday, January 12 from

Candle Lighting
Service Sunday

The traditional Epiphany Candle-
lighting Service, more commonly
known as the Twelfth Night Service,
will be presented in Rockefeller Me-
morial Chapel on Sunday at 7:30 p.m.

Participating in the service will be
the University Choir, directed by
Mack Evans, and the Acolytes from
the Church of the Redeemer.

The tradition of this annual service,
which was used as a theme in one of
Shakespeare’s plays, dates back to
medieval times when Christmas
greens were burned and the candles
relighted on the twelfth night after
Christmas.

Candles which will bank the altar
at the chapel are to be lighted by the
Acolytes during the reading of an ap-
propriate service. Following this,
candles symbolizing the twelve disci-
ples will be lighted and these in turn
will be used to light the candles of the
choir.

Admission to the services, which
are scheduled to take about 50 min-
utes, is without ticket or charge.

World Student Service Fund
Organizes Drive For War Victims

To aid students and teachers who
are war victims, prisoners of war, in-
ternees and refugees, the World Stu-
dent Service Fund has organized its
annual drive which will begin on cam-
pus on February 6 and will continue
through February 16. By co-operat-
ing in this international campaign,
American students are taking part in
the world enterprise of student-to-
student help. Last year’s drive on
the campus was the most successful
one in the history of this co-operation.
The entire campus will be asked to
participate as much as possible in this
drive.

Miss Lola Mayer, a traveling sec-
retary of the W.S.S.F., assisted stu-
dents in planning the drive. A native
of Germany, she has experienced the
difficulties of youth under the Nazi
regime. After a year at the Univer-

More Members,
Council Of 40

Climaxing more than two years of
study of the conflicts between Presi-
dent Hutchins and the University Sen-
ate, the Board of Trustees, meeting on
Thursday, December 28, adopted “new
procedures” under which educational
policy of the University is to be deter-
mined by joint action of the faculty
and the president, with the Board of
Trustees resolving any disagreement.

The procedures were recommended
to the Board by its Committee on
Instruction and Research.

The committee, with Laird Bell as
chairman, has been studying the
University’s educational organization
with the assistance of a Senate com-
mittee of which Professor Leonard D.
White has been acting as chairman.
The new procedures, the report said,
are designed to provide “both the
unifying influence of firm administra-
tive control and the critical reactions
of many scholarly minds.”

Six main points are involved:

1.	The University Senate, which has
heretofore been composed entirely
of full professors, is broadened to
include associate professors and as-
sistant professors who have been
members of the faculty for three
years.

2.	This Senate is to elect a Council of
about forty members which is to
act on all educational issues and
which is to meet at least quarterly.

3.	The new Council is to elect an Ex-
ecutive Committee of seven which
will be continuously in touch with
the President.

4.	The Council is to take affirmative
action on educational matters, and
is to have the right to disapprove
proposals of the president in this
field. The president likewise has
a veto over actions of the Council.
Should the president and Council
be unable to resolve the issue, the
Board will make the final decision.

5.	As is customary at other leading
endowed universities, the president
may recommend faculty appoint-
ments to the Board a^ter consulta-
tion with the departments, the prac-
tice by which the president has
recommended faculty appointments

Tyler Declares 15, 16 Year Olds
Mature Enough For College Work

Recent studies have demonstrated
that by all tests students 15 and 16
years old are mature enough to under-
take the intellectual work of college,
Professor Ralph W. Tyler, University
examiner and Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Education, declared recently
at a luncheon of the Citizens Board
of the University.

In an address entitled “New Light
on Basic Issues in American Educa-
tion,” Professor Tyler said that from
studies made in the College “it is
clear that students who have taken
the college courses at the age of 15,
16, or 17, have done just as well as
students who have taken the courses
at 18, 19, and 20.”

“There is no evidence to justify the
conclusion that students of 15 and 16
are too young to undergo the intel-
lectual work of college,” Mr. Tyler
asserted. “Rather, the evidence sug-
gests that they are mature enough
and that they need the opportunity
for mental stimulation.

“If we are to improve the education
of adolescents during the next 15
years as we have improved the educa-
tion of younger children, it will require
a reshaping of our high school so
that the work of the high school can

Heavy Demand for
Full-time Contracts
Prevents Extension

The demand for contracts under
the full-service plan voted at the Uni-
versity a year ago has been so heavy
that only one-half the faculty mem-
bers desiring them have been admitted
to the plan because of the financial
burden to the university, Ernest C.
Colwell, Vice-president and Dean of
the Faculties, disclosed recently.

The contracts, which can be sought
voluntarily by all faculty members
above the rank of instructor and are
compulsory for all new appointees
above the instructor rank, provide for
work in four quarters and require the
teachers to turn over to the university
all outside compensation earned from
royalties on books, lecture and con-
sultant fees, and similar activities.
To compensate for this loss of outside
income, salary adjustments are pro-
vided. Faculty members making the
change are given an average salary
increase of about $900.

First call on the new contracts is
given assistant professors, who, ac-
cording to President Robert M.
Hutchins, are most in need of
salary improvements. The plan
is “designed to make possible
the more rapid developments of young
men scholars and teachers by remov-
ing the financial pressure which leads
them to give time and energy to un-
productive piece work,” President
Hutchins has said.

The full-service policy was adopted
in line with measures taken in the
summer of 1943, when it was decided
that neither the university nor mem-
bers of its staff should profit from
patents arising out of research work.
The step was taken on the recom-
mendation of President Hutchins.

“Also, we must provide a college
program fhich stimulates and guides
intellectual development, placing re-
sponsibility upon the student and giv-
ing him opportunity for independent
work so that he can complete his col-
lege education at the age of 18 to 20
and be enabled at that time to go
into an occupation or to enter the
university for training required for
the professions.”

Further studies made at the Uni-
versity show that students entering
the College after the sophomore year
of high school are on a par mentally
with those entering after high school
graduation, Mr. Tyler said. This has
been demonstrated in tests of intel-
ligence, reading, writing, and com-
putation.

He also cited the results of an in-
quiry by the National Society for the
Study of Education which revealed
that so far as the biological and
mental equipment is concerned, stu-
dents reach a degree of maturity
“somewhere between age 14 and 16
that should make successful college
work possible.”

“Tests of mechanical abilities show
that a plateau is reached at about
age 15,” Mr. Tyler continued. “Var-
ious studies of mental growth have
been made and indicate that although
mental growth is not stopped even at
age 24, the growth curves flatten out
typically between age 15 and 16, so
that most young people at\ this age
have ninety percent of the mental
abilities characteristic of adults.
There is also evidence to suggest that
the degree of mental growth from the
age 15 on depends very largely upon
the amount of intellectual stimula-
tion.”

Studies made in the last 10 years
show “that in a good elementary school
today, by the end of the sixth grade,
children are able to read, write, spell,
and compute as effectively as were
eighth grade children in the early
1920’s,” Prof. Tyler said. “At the
present time the critical part of the
educational program is that of the
high school.”

Dames Open Winter
Season With Party

The University Dames will open its
winter program of social events with
a bridge party for husbands on the
evening of January 13 at Ida Noyes
Hall.

Mrs. Gale Johnson, chairman of the
party, requests that those planning to
attend please make reservations with
her in advance by calling Plaza 7421.
A fee of thirty cents per person will
be charged.

Anyone eligible for membership in
Dames—wives of students and facul-
ty members—is cordially invited to
attend, and to affiliate with the group
in its winter quarter activities. The
year’s schedule includes Saturday
program teas, sewing, bridge, and
discussion groups on topics of varied
interest.

THE CHICAGO MAROON —
Clothing Needed
For Greek War
Relief Drive

During the week of January 8, the
Chicago Committee of the American
Friends of Greece will sponsor a
clothing drive for the Greek War Re-
lief Association.

Men’s, women’s and children’s gar-
ments are desperately needed and the
demand for shoes and bedding is also
great. Greece, although a Mediter-
ranean country, is mountainous, the
winters are severe and warm clothing
is essential. Delivery of all articles
can be made from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily at Oriental Institute, 1155 East
58th Street.

The American Friends of Greece,
a national organization, was founded
in 1923 to strengthen and promote
cultural bonds and greater under-
standing between the peoples of
Greece and the United States. The
Chicago Committee, organized last
spring, is headed by Dean R. P. Mc-
Keon.

to the Board only with the approval
of the department concerned being
discontinued. If the department in-
volved does not approve, the Board
will decide whether the appoint-
ments should be made.

6.	The Board maintains its preroga-
tive to create or discontinue units
in the University when in its judg-
ment it is desirable to do so.

The Board has asked the Senate to
appoint a Committee to cooperate in
putting the new organization into
effect.

“The Board has pride in the emin-
ence and achievements of the faculty
of the University of Chicago, and it
has confidence in the leadership of
the president,” Harold H. Swift, chair-
man of the Board, said in announcing
the action. “Our purpose is to pro-
vide a means by which the faculty and
the president can cooperate more effec-
tively and establish a better exchange
of ideas and information than present
procedures permit. We believe we
have made this possible, and in so
doing have strengthened the Univer-
sity.”

President Robert M. Hutchins said,
“Although the plan is not perfect—I
must admit that I still prefer my
own!—it is better than the scheme
under which we have been laboring.
I hope that it will commend itself to
all the members of the University.”

Approximately 155 assistant and
associate professors will be eligible for
the Senate, increasing its present
membership of about 195 to close to
350.

Members of the Committee on In-
struction and Research, which sub-

mitted the report, are: Laird Boll
chairman; William Scott Bond, Max
Epstein, Paul V. Harper, John Nu-
veen, Jr., Paul S. Russell, and Hermon
D. Smith.

In their report to the Board of
Trustees, taken from the files of the
Maroon, but never released for pub-
lication, the Senate Committee on Ac-
ademic Reorganization recommended
“a senate which includes exofficio all
members of the faculty who hold per-
manent tenure.” The report, which
was not accepted by the Board, went
on to say that “such a body can be
fully effecient for the performance of
its task with the leadership and guid-
ance of the proposed Executive Com-
mittee.”

The report also stated that the Com-
mittee had “steadfastly presented the
view to the Trustees that the final
decision on matters of educational
policy should rest with the faculty,
speaking through the University Sen-
ate. At the same time we have made
clear to the Trustees our desires to
retain the full power of the President
to initiate, propose and advocate mat-
ters of educational policy with regard
to any part of the University.”

The results of a hasty poll, taken
by the Maroon, of members of the
faculty seemed to indicate favorable
reaction to the new plan. Comments
such as “a step in the right direction”,
“the next best thing to the Hutchins
plan”, and “I think it quite nice that
a larger per cent of the faculty will
have a voice in the University pol-
icies,” were received.

Brady to Speak
At Burton-Judson

At the first discussion group to
meet in Burton Court for the winter
quarter, Robert A. Brady, visiting
professor of Social Science from the
University of Southern California,
will speak in the east Lounge Monday
evening, January 8, at 7:30. One of
the country’s foremost experts on the
cartel, Professor Brady will speak on
that subject.

All students in the last two years
of the college taking the Social Science
survey course are invited. Following
a short question period, there will be
a discussion on the college program
with special emphasis on Social Sci-
ence courses.

- THE CHICAGO MAROON
Dr. Peters Urges
U.S. Medical Change

It is necessary for the physicians
of the United States to go to Congress
now and show the lawmakers that a
fundamental change is needed in the
medical system of this country, de-
clared Dr. John P. Peters, Ely Profes-
sor of Medicine at Yale University, in
his appearance Sunday on the Uni-
versity of Chicago Round Table
broadcast.

“The time has come,” he continued,
“when a national system of group
medical care is needed. Local pro-
grams of group medicine are not
enough. The problem of giving ade-
quate medical care can be solved only
by a program of universal coverage.

“If the doctors of this country do
not think that certain provisions of
the present plans for a national sys-
tem are advisable, it is up to them to
make them light, but the time for an
essential change in our medical sys-
tem is here,” he added.

Participating with Peters in the
Round Table discussion of “Should
We Adopt Government Health In-
surance?” were Dr. Victor Johnson,
Secretary of the Council on Medical
Education and Hospitals of the Amer-
ican Medical Association, and Louis
Wirth, Associate Dean of the Division
of Social Science and Professor of
Sociology at the University.

Dr. Johnson, disagreeing with Pet-
ers, said that he did not feel that this
country was ready to undertake a na-
tional system.

“There are serious deficiencies, we
all admit,” he said, “in the present
state of medical care in the United
States. But, as yet, we do not have
sufficient evidence of what is needed
to establish really good program.
We must go on experimenting with
local plans for group health and
medical care, and out of those experi-
ments work out the best possible pro-

gram. But, at the present time, we
simply do not have the information
to set up a good program.

“If we, by too hasty action, set up
a poor plan that fails, it is likely
that the people will be disillusionec
and go against all future plans,” he
said.

Professor Wirth emphasized the
inadequacy of present medical care,
especially among the lower income
groups, and declared that high costs
stand in the way of proper medical
care for three-fourths of the Ameri-
can people.

“We, therefore, need a nationa
program,” Wirth said, “which wil
help to iron out the great gap between
what we know about medical science
and the utilization of that knowledge.

coming a public system in much the

Also included on the roll was Robert
Redfield, Dean of the Division of So-
cial Sciences and Professsdr of An-
thropology at the University, who was
lonored for his devoted pioneering in
presenting the racial problem to vast
white audiences over the radio and
in magazine articles.

In announeng the honors Dr. Loch-
ard made the following statement:
“In a turbulent world at war, still in
the grip of the hate and greed un-
loosed in all lands, America stood
through 1944 as a lonely beacon for
democracy despite the savage and sul-
len assaults on the people’s will by
men of evil. The triumph of good
will and understanding among the
great common people of this nation
belongs in good part to these valiant,
sincere and honest Americans who
have fought fearlessly and relentlessly
to crack the barriers of racial preju-
dice and make this America truly
democracy’s land. To those men of
good will, Negro and white, the Chi-
cago Defender again this year pays
tribute for their contribution to racial
harmony.”

Why Student Government?

Time and time again, in our efforts to investigate and stim-
ulate opinion about a student government, we have been asked,
“Why bother with a student government? We have no problems,
and it would be useless without problems to solve.” Such an
attitude is unrealistic in the extreme.

For one thing, the raison d'etre of a government isn’t merely
the solution of immediate problems. The student has an obligation
to himself and the University to participate in the formulation
and the execution of policy pertaining to all student matters.

However, there are matters for immediate consideration by a
student government. There are, for example, the problems which
will arise when a large number of war veterans return to the
University, an event we all hope will occur in the not-too-distant
future. Some of these problems—chiefly those which involve such
matters as teaching methods and courses of study—are already
under discussion by educators, as witness a recent topic on the
University Roundtable, “The G.I. Bill and Education.” But others
—those pertaining to the vast realm of outside-the-classroom
activities—are as yet unstudied, at least to our knowledge. Or if
they have been studied, no plan for their solution has been an-
nounced. And these are the very problems which will be, super-
ficially and temporarily at least, of greatest interest to the war
veteran and to his fellow student without a service record.

We must decide in the very near future, before the influx of
the several thousand veterans University authorities predict,
whether we wish to reintegrate these veterans into all phases of
campus life, or whether we shall allow them to form just another
“indigestible” group in the already disunited University commun-
ity. Whichever policy we choose, it will then be necessary to draw
up a comprehensive program, covering housing, extra-curricular
activities, and social affairs, to implement that policy. And we
maintain that the students now on campus must accept a large part
of the responsibility for drawing up that policy and its accompany-
ing program, since the task of making any plan effective will
largely rest with them.

Such a problem as this one could be ideally dealt with by a
representative student government, which would have the neces-
sary personnel, prestige, and power for solving it. And this is
only one of many.

would be wary of him because of the
deluge of bad prose and poetry he had
submitted under his real name, Thom-

as Lanier Williams. His mother still
calls him Tom, and his middle name
shows that he is a relative of Sidney
Lanier. Williams spent his childhood
in the rectory of his grandfather who
was an Episcopal clergyman. He was
extremely shy as a child and because
he was rather weak and sickly he
spent much of his time reading the
English classics, in his grandfather’s
library, none of which he has read
since, he claims, with the exception
of Shakespeare. He began writing
at about the age of ten, and because
he had a terror of falling asleep, he
would make up stories in bed. He
could visualize them as one might a
motion picture, even perceiving color
and dimension. He attributes one of

the reasons for his preference for
drama to this desire of seeing action
itself unfold before his eyes instead
of mere word associations on the

printed page.

Problems of the Proletariat

Williams attended public school
and was anti-social thru high school.
It was not until he went to the Uni-
versity of Missouri that he formed
any extensive social contacts. After
two years of bad grades and ever-
growing despondency, his father took
him from the University and put him
in an office position at a shoe com-
pany. This experience was go appal-
ling to him that it caused a nervous
paralysis. No cause could be found
for the paralysis, and it was not un-
til after his father had informed the
shoe company that Tennessee would
not return, that he recovered. This
affair at the shoe company was re-
sponsible for his later writing a so-
cial drama called “Stairs to the
Roof”, about the problem of the white
collar worker, “which”, says Wil-
liams, “most white collar workers
don’t seem to recognize as a prob-
lem”. Following his paralysis, he
was then twenty-two, he went to the
University of Iowa where he worked
as a waiter, financially on his own.

Williams’ “Life In Art”

He is now thirty, and the interven-
ing eight years he describes in the
preface to his poems in Five Young
American Poets, 1944. Briefly they
were years of wandering, writing, and
gaining experience, years of tremen-
dous importance. These eight years
have instilled in his writing a haunt-
ing intensity and a thirst for living
comparable to that of Hart Crane and
Walt Whitman. His intensity is not
restricted to his poetry: the Theatre
Guild production of “Battle of An-
gels” was banned in Boston. Tennes-
see refers to this play rather flippant-
ly as “a sex play with cosmic over-
tones”. The play will be published
for the first time by New Directions
sometime this winter.

The theatre is his great interest, for
reasons already mentioned and also
because he thinks that it is only in
the theatre that Jie will be able to
earn a living. After the impoverished
eight year odyssey this latter reason
seems of tremendous importance to
him.

Around

The Town

Fully rested, it says here, from two
weeks of over-sleeping, your Around-
the-Towner is ready once more to con-
sume a few thousand extra calories
while allowing Otto, the column’s pet
tape-worm, to run rampant. True to
tradition (and Otto’s appetite) we’ve
found just the spot to begin with.

Some evening when you drag out
the Alpine ice picks and brave Chicago
winds, desirous of something satisfy-
ing in the way of a meal, head for
63rd Street’s wilderness and Phelps
and Phelps.

Whether just the place to get that
first date off to a good start, or merely
to settle down for some small talk
and an old fashioned dinner, Phelps
and Phelps is ready to give its all
with food, atmosphere and service.

The gayly decorated revolutionary
period rooms of light blue chintz, pol-
ished brass, and softly shaded lamps
are familiar scenes to old-timers
hereabouts, and will be to all of you
before long, or we’ll miss a guess.

Food is stressed as a thing of
beauty as well as a palate tempter.
From the first crackers in tiny in-
dividual baskets, to the last of Mrs.
Phelps* pie, your meal will be thor-
oughly enjoyable. About twice a
week our pet cook digs up the swellest
steaks, served at their juiciest mo-
ment. Speaking of service, Otto says
he has a growing suspicion that the
gang at Phelps and Phelps “don’t
know” there’s a war on! No one
snaps, service is smooth and Mr.
Phelps himself keeps up the grand old
tradition of greeting folks at the
door.

Phelps and Phelps is the be-ribbon-
ed package that was dropped at your
front door. Why not open it and take
a peek?

♦ ♦ ♦

Otto there has absolutely no scru-
ples these days. After that dream
date which firmly planted lovely stars
in our eyes, he demanded food, regard-
less of wee hours. We thought of
taking back his yo-yo, but decided on
manna from heaven (or a reasonable
facsimile thereof in the form of ham-
burgers) instead. Stumbling past 63rd
Street we felt that Columbus urge
coming on and discovered that the
Dorchester Restaurant, 63rd and Dor-
chester remains open all night.

The amazing part of all this is that
you can find something substantial to
gnaw at way into the night, at hours
when our usual ptomaine-taverns are
sleeping soundly. Don’t let this fool
you though, for the food is good, from
steaks to bacon and eggs. Just the
spot for after-date snacks.

This is no greasy spoon either. Har-
ry, the proud papa, proclaims the Dor-
chester to be the South Side's “most
beautiful,” and he isn’t far off. It’s
really a pleasure to find something as
lovely and yet so clean. Even Otto
was satisfied when we toddled out
and headed for home...B.C.

disinclined to comment. He makes no
critical appraisal of his plays, beyond
that they are roughly written in
blank verse. He considers “The Dan-
gerous Painters” his best poem. New

an edition of his short stories which
magazines have refused to accept “be-
cause of their subject matter and the
subjective approach”.

I the REPUBLICANS’ HISTORY OF
I THE UNITED STATES
|	Chapter XI

I The era of Henry Clay, Daniel Web-
I ster, Calhoun, and Andrew Jackson
I was brought to a close by the great
I Mexican War. After diligent research
I in the foyer outside Harper W 31, this
I historian has arrived at the incontro-
I vertible conclusion that this was the
I only completely justifiable war in
I American history. The United States,
I having committed no unfriendly act
I toward Mexico, except, of course, the
I annexation of a small and insignifi-
I cant Mexican province known by the
quaint Hispanic name of Texas, was
brutally attacked by the overwhelm-
ing forces of the Mexican aggressor.
So swift was the attack of the Mexi-
cans that they cleared the customs
office in Laredo in the record time of
34 hours and 27 minutes. The army
swept onward to San Antonio where,
led by the Mexican generals Santa
Anna and Pasadena, it besieged the
valiant Texans in the local ice cream
factory. The Mexicans ruthlessly de-

I stroyed both the factory and its de-
fenders, causing a total ice cream
famine which lasted throughout the
war, giving rise to the famous Texan
battle cry, “Remember the a la mode!”
The Americans were reluctant to
face the horrors of war against the
Mexicans until the government point-
ed out how great would be the booty
taken from Mexico City. They then
enlisted in large numbers and marched
off shouting the well known battle
cry, “Ho for the hauls of Montezuma!”
The fighting of the war was made
extremely* arduous by a devastating
secret weapon of the Mexicans
known as “El hot tamale”, a primitive
sort of hand grenade. El hot tamale
produced among the Americans a pe-
culiar battle condition well known to
the Mexicans as “La enfermedad que
se llama ptomaine.” General Win-
field Scott, commander of the Amer-
ican forces, was once brought a ta-
male. After smelling it he accused
the Mexicans of violating internation-
al law by using poison gas.

The student will be interested to

discover that it was in this
tion that Americans received
pellation of “Gringos”.^ An
folk legend circulated in the

an American writhing in the agony
of a tamale, one would invariably re-
mark “See how green goes hees face,
amigos!”

It is easily seen that General Scott
was justified in using any means to
combat the tamale. Scott issued an
edict to the Mexicans saying that if
they did not cease fighting immediate-
ly he would administer his emulsion to
all prisoners he might capture. At
the very thought of taking Scott’s
emulsion the Mexican troops were
thrown into a complete rout from
which they never recovered. The
Mexican government immediately
sued for peace, the treaty being writ-
ten by the great Mexican statesman,
Guadalupe Hidalgo, in a series of two
conferences with American officials.
These were the first and second Mexi-
can Sessions.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
is a monument to General Scott. Upon
seeing it, even the Mexicans readily
admitted the General’s greatness. It
is recorded that after reading it, the
first words were “Great Scott!” The
salient provisions were as follows:

1.	Mexico should seed all the land
north of the Rio Grande. The imper-

/ection of farm implements at
time made this quite difficult.

2.	All fortifications along the
Grande were to be demolished

the

Rio
(ex-

cept the customs office at Laredo.)

3.	Mexico should export annually
10,000 illiterates to the United States
so that Jane Addams might have
some subjects with whom to earn un-
dying fame.

4.	Mexico should be subjected to an
annual invasion by a gigantic, well
equipped army of husky, red-blooded,
retired school teachers.

The historian regrets exceedingly
that he passed over Andrew Jackson,
the hermit, so briefly, but he was a
Democrat, which prevented his being
a Great Man, F. N. E. in A. H., etc.

The English have always had a knack
for playing Bach well, and Templeton
was no exception. Those who remem-
bered Harold Samuel’s distinguished
interpretation of the English Suite in
A Minor were agreeably surprised by
Templeton’s verve in the Bouree from
this suite. His light staccato touch
lent clarity to the melodic line. In
the Prelude and Fugue in E Flat
Minor (from the first book of The
Well-Tempered Clavichord) the calm
beauty of the prelude was effectively
contrasted with the more solemn na-
ture of the fugue. A slight freedom
of tempo, not in accordance with the

strictest interpretation of
not, however, obscure the
the fugue’s voices.

Then came Templeton’s

Bach, did
clarity of

own tran-

scription of Haydn’s celebrated Ser-
enade, second movement of the little
Quartet in F, Op. 3, No. 5, in a some-
what un-Haydnesque form. The tran-
scription was reasonably faithful to
the original except for a four-note
grace note at the beginning of each
statement of the theme.

Scriabin Fiery

Also outstanding were Templeton’s
interpretation of Brahms’ Intermezzo
in B Flat Minor, and Scriabin’s Poem
in F Sharp and Etude in D Sharp
Minor. The Brahms was played with
quiet introspection and the Scriabin
etude had the true bravurra style
needed to put an old warhorse across,
being played with flash and fire.

Brilliant Improvisations

After intermission Templeton played
three of his own compositions: Noc-
turne from Lick in E Flat, Handel
with Care, and Gounod Weds Nola.
A suitable “lick” was wrapped up in
the style of the Chopin Nocturne in
E Flat, a Handel Concerto Grosso
was “swung”, and the ballet music
from Faust found itself in rather
strange company—all pleasant listen-
ing. This was followed by improvisa-
tion on a five note theme, the notes
being called out by the audience: this
same theme was then dressed up in
the styles of Mozart’s Don Giovanni;
the last movement of Tschaikowsky’s
Pathetique and the 1812 Overture;
the Polka from Shostakovitch’s Age
of Gold; and Gershwin’s Rhapsody in
Blue with Summer Time thrown in
for good measure. As an improvisa-
tor Templeton stands supreme at the
moment; and it is to be regretted that
it is an art which is not more assid-
uosly cultivated in the present day.

THE GREAT
MR. HANDEL....
Unreeling at the
Playhouse in its
Chicago premiere,
the British produc-
tion of “The Great
M r. Handel” is
magnificently, if a
little starchily ex-
ecuted. There are
few truly dramatic
situations, no great

spectacle, comparatively little plot,
and no sex, none of which are called
for anyway. There is a conflict, to
be sure, between the Prince of Wales
and Handel, but the greatest drama
in the movie is in the thrilling power
of Handel’s music, superbly played
by the London Philharmonic. The
music, in regard to the instruments,
is carefully not anachronistic. It
sounds approximately as it would have
in the middle eighteenth century.

Wilfred Lawson gave a restrained
and dignified performance, causing an
impression of quiet dynamic force.
As Mrs. Cibber, the beautiful actress
and singer, Elizabeth Allen is all that
made that lady famous in history.
She has a lovely voice, and is poised
and beautiful, but she is not given
much chance to prove her dramatic
talents.

The plot covers that black period
in Handel’s life when he was faced
with ruin because of the almost over-
powering opposition of his enemies,
among them notably the Prince of
Wales and his fashionable set. After
a long illness, bitter unpopularity,
and great depression (financial as well
as mental) he finally writes his great
“Messiah,” spurred by divine inspira-
tion. The work is immediately suc-
cessful, restoring him to the people’s
favor, and the picture closes in a
brilliant burst of the “Hallelujah
Chorus.”

Sidelights on Footlights

“The Glass Menagerie” is an in-
toxicating play. It is surrounded
with a kind of misty quality which
eludes description, or even analogy,
as might possibly be conceived, to
Maeterlinck, or Wilder, or Saroyan.
In short, it introduces us to a new
and vivid dramatist, Tennessee Wil-
liams. Mr. Williams has created a
mood, an illusion, in “The Glass Men-
agerie” that is at once delicate yet
tangible, delightful but sad. It com-
bines the realities of life with the
shading qualities of memory, a com-
bination which results in a play, half
poetry, half hard fact, a unique and
insurpassable experience to the spec-
tator.

The piece carries no special moral;
one is not aware of any particular
message, although certainly many
could easily be constructed. If the
scene is a tenement house, it is not
sordid; if the people are poor, they are
not elemental. In broad outline, it is
merely the story of Tom, his domi-
neering mother, and his crippled sis-
ter. Complications set in, when, at
his mother’s insistence that Laura
collect some gentlemen admirers, Tom
brings home a friend for dinner. At
first Laura refuses to be drawn away
from hdr world of glass animals, but
finally the gentleman manages to
help her vault her wall of shyness and
fear, only to push her back again
when he tells her he is engaged to be
married. Not much of a plot to be
sure, but entirely sufficient. For the
drama woven by the author, the ac-
tors, and aided by the magnificent

Startling Discovery!

“Ambition hath no limits,” the
copy desk of The Maroon might well
reiterate this week.

A reporter, assigned to cover
Hutchinson Commons, in desperation
submitted this tasty morsel of news
copy:

“In Hutchinson Commons there
are 50 tables and 366 chairs. There
are 74 salt shakers on these tables
and 74 sugar bowls. Twenty por-
traits decorate the walls.”

set and haunting incidental music is
tremendously effective.

The performance of Laurette Tay-
lor, as the mother, is flawless and un-
forgettable, ranking with any we have
seen here in many years. Anthony
Ross does an excellent job as the gen-
tleman caller, and although his role
is less trying, he is no less perfect
than Miss Taylor. Julie Haydon has
probably the most difficult part in the
play, since a failure on her part to
carry across Laura’s sylph-like char-
acter, the essence of “The Glass Men-
agerie”, would mean failure of the
whole evening. Only in spots were
her transitions a bit hazy, was her
Laura indefinitive. Mr. Dowling, how-
ever, producer and part director,
seemed incongruous enough to spoil
the unity of effect most often and
most needlessly. In places he steps
out of character, and becomes, either
Eddie Dowling, mugging, or someone
else; not the Tom in the play. He was
though, despite the few' relapses, con-
vincing in his dual role, and he as
well as Miss Jones, must take credit
for the splendid direction.

But then, after all, “The Glass
Menagerie” is a play to see, not read
about. If Mr. Williams’ fine work,
presented so brilliantly, does not suc-
ceed in Chicago, it ip certainly evi-
dence of either lack of taste or lack
of interest. Since sold out houses for
the other bits of nothing in town ex-
clude the possibility of lack of inter-
est, unfortunately, it leaves the al-
ternative, lack of taste, which might
possibly explain why we don’t get
more and better plays.

10/000 Witness Stagg Games
AsSenn WinsHoliday Crown

More than 10,000 spectators wit-
nessed the annual Stagg holiday
games according to an unofficial esti-
mate. Thirty-four public high schools
of the Chicago area took part in the
eliminations in which Senn high
school won top honors.

Senn, a dark horse of the tourna-
ment, knocked off Gage Park’s highly
touted five which had previously won
13 games in a row, 37-33. A New
Year’s Day crowd of 3,500 was kept on
its feet for most of the game as both
teams fought bitterly for the advan-
tage as the lead changed hands sever-
al times in the first minutes of the
second half. Senn took a one point
lead with four minutes of the third
quarter and held on until the end of
the game.

The earlier game for third place
between Waller and Wells saw Wells
being outrun by the rugged west side
quintet in a battle which ended in a

THE CHICAGO MAROON ------------------

Chicago Closes1944with Two Game
Split Against Williams, Navy Radio

Maroons Meet Navy
In Second Battle

At Home Tomorrow

The surprising Maroons, possessors
of a better than .500 percent average,
bump up against Chicago Naval Radio
tomorrow night in their first encount-
er of the new year. It was the Navy
Radio squad which edged the Uni-
versity in its last game before the
holidays by a scant two point margin.

With many of Norgren’s injured
players improving their condition
during their two week lay off, Coach
Nels should be able to field a quintet
which can give the victorious Navy
squad something to think about. Fred
DeGraw, handicapped by a bad knee
and foot, hit the nets for 13 points
against the Navy and seemed to have
the boys in blue thoroughly confused
with his innumerable fakes and shots.

Howard Brokken, veteran Navy
player should be in his usual top form
and Bob Kuhn, previously suffering
from an injured knee, is expected to
make a strong comeback in tomor-
row’s game. Big George Raby and
lightning fast John Sharp will com-
plete the Maroon varsity’s strongest
combination.

The University’s defense will have
to be on sharp lookout for Bob Bie-
terman, the little man with the two
zeros on his back. Bieterman was the
Navy’s chief scoring threat as he drop-
ped in 13 points and played a hangup
floor game. Harry Janchenko and
Don Curb will also warrant watching
in what the Chicago boys hope will
be a revenge meeting.

Tomorrow’s battle marks the final
appearance of the .home team in the
fieldhouse. After the Navy game they
go to George Williams College and
Wheaton College to complete their
1944-45 schedule. The game will be-
gin promptly at 8:00 at the Fieldhouse

with the usual band and cheerleaders.

Intra Basketball
Program Announced

Three leagues are being planned for
the all-University intramural basket-
ball program scheduled to start Jan.
16, according to J. Kyle Anderson,
Chicago athletic director. A separate
bracket will be provided for service
and medic squads on the campus while
men of the first two years will form
a second and the last two years will
:orm the third.

Each team will play one game a
week on either Tuesday, Wednesday
or Thursday starting at 7:00. The
deadline for team entries is January
11 at 4:00 in Bartlett Gymnasium. In
order to start the program promptly»
Jr. Anderson urgently requested
that as many of these teams be en-
tered before that date as possible.

The games are expected to carry
through January and February with
playoffs ending the last week in Feb-
ruary. Varsity men who are compet-
ing in any regular sport during the
two months of play are ineligible to
take part in intramural basketbail.
Coach Anderson announced that this
includes indoor trackmen and boys m
the first two year basketball team.

Team Keeps
Plus Rating

Chicago closed its 1944 end of the
basketball season with a two game
split against George Williams anc
the Chicago Naval Radio Station.
The Maroons extended their winning
streak to four games when they hand-
ed George Williams College a 39-31
setback December 16 at the Field-
house. Chicago Naval Radio broke the
string on December 20 when they
edged put the University 45-43, with
the winning Navy besket coming with
but 10 seconds to play.

George Raby had another gooc
night against the Williams five as he
dropped in 10 markers to lead the
Maroons to a nine point win. Chicago
was trailing at the half, 22-19 but
Nels Norgren’s rapidly improving
squad closed that deficit and outscored
Williams 20-8 in the second period.

Steady, dependable Howard Brok-

Indoor Track Team
Well Under Way
For Big Ten Meet

Varsity practice for indoor track
is well under way at the Field House,
Coach Ned Merriam has announced.
He also stated that a practice meet
would be held with Northwestern Uni-
versity on January 27. At present,
though, a great number of positions on
the Maroon squad are still open, and
Coach Merriam urges all men inter-
ested to report to the Field House.
Practice is held from 3:00 to 5:00 ev-
ery afternoon, and the individual mem-
bers of the team are rapidly getting
into shape. There will be several dual
meets after the first one with North-
western, with the Big Ten meet as a
climax. This year the Big Ten meet
will be held here in Chicago, at the
Field House. The date has been set

for sometime in March.

ken followed Raby with 9 points while
Harry Rohlman of the Williams quin-
tet took, game honors with 4 baskets
and 3 gift tosses. Brokken’s play in
this contest and on previous occasions
has been one of the highlights of the
Maroon team and coupled with civil-
ians Raby, John Sharp, and Fred De-
Graw the Navy trainee has turned in
a good season.

Naval Radio Wins

The last game of the old year
brought with it the end of the Ma-
roons’ winning streak as the Naval
Radio School outlasted Chicago in a
tight match, 45-43. The University
trailed 14-16 at the half after How-
ie Brokken dropped in a sensational
one-handed pivot shot from the center
of the floor to bring the Maroons with-
in 2 points of the Radio team.

Veteran Fred DeGraw hit his scor-
ing pace once more with 6 baskets and
a free throw while Navy man Kuhn,
on the Chicago squad and just recov-
ering from an injured knee, almost
saved the game with a last minute
one handed push shot but Navy Radio
came back with 10 seconds to play and
Bieterman returned the compliment
with an identical one handed push to
set the final score at 46 to 43.

DeGraw Scores 13 Points

Fred DeGraw of Chicago and Bob
Bieterman of Navy split game honors
with 13 points apiece while Kuhn
scored 9 points and Brokken 4 buck-
ets. George Raby was handicapped
somewhat by the taller Navy men but
he made a major portion of the Uni-
versity’s rebounds and accounted for
five points.
