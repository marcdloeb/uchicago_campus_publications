Faculty Okays 3 Major College Curriculum Revisions

To Affect Only
New Students

Requirement’s for the bachelor’s
degree for the majority of students
entering the first year of the College
next fall will include two years of
English, one year of a foreign
language, and three years of a
natural sciences survey, under action
taken last Friday by the College
faculty. The revisions, made as part
of a continuous program of improve-
ment of the curriculum, will not af-
fect students already enrolled or
those who enter in the summer.

The new requirements have been
formulated in terms of the number
of comprehensives which must be
taken by the average student, al-
though under the system of placement
examinations a number of students
will probably be excused from some
comprehensives.

Mathematics 1, a course offered for
the first time this year will also be
required for graduation after next
fall. In addition, all students taking
a foreign language sequence, begin-
ning this summer, must take Lan-
guage 1, a twelve-week course in the
linguistic principles common to all
languages.

Although average students entering
in the first year will be expected to
take two years of English, there will
be special remedial classes for those
who have not attained the basic pro-
ficiency necessary. Students entering
at the third year will probably take
one year of English, although reme-
dial courses will be open to them
also.

The new natural sciences survey
will be required for those beginning
in the first year only. It will replace
the current combination of physical
and biological science courses. Phys-
ical Sciences 3 and Biological Sciences
3 will be retained for third-year stu-
dents, however.

An Important Announcement

The Maroon Reconverts...

The University of Chicago, for four long years an integral
link in the nation’s war machine, is moving back to peacetime
footing. And similarly THE CHICAGO MAROON, for 43 years
an integral part of this University, is in the process of recon-
version.

With this edition THE MAROON completes 18 months of
uninterrupted publication and its fourth year of half-speed war-
time editions. The exigencies of war have placed a premium on
printing facilities and staff personnel, in addition to seriously cur-
tailing the campus activity program, reducing the potentialities
for news coverage.

The shift to its former status necessitates an intensive and
ambitious program involving transfer of headquarters to a new
site, reorganization of the staff, and expansion blueprints. Be-
cause of the difficulties involved and the urgency for completing
these preliminary maneuvers at the earliest possible moment,

Charges Moral Confusion Is
Gripping US; 458 Graduated

Adolph Hitler’s doctrines have paralyzed the nation to polit-
ical and moral disintegration and threatened collapse of world
peace hopes, President Robert M. Hutchins charged Friday in a
highly provocative 20-minute commencement day address deliv-
ered before nearly 4,000 persons in Rockefeller chapel at the
221st convocation exercises.

Reitering his now famed plea for
justice and mercy for the defeated
enemy, the president likened the
building of the peace to reconstruc-
tion of Union at the end of the Civil
War. He concluded his address with
Lincoln’s second inaugural.

Earlier he had claimed “the new
realism of today is unrealistic for
it is thwarting our own interests and
is blind to the facts of history and
of human nature.”

Hutchin’s challenging oration high-
lighted the day-long ceremonies as
the University conferred 478 degrees
in two separate exercises. An addi-
tional 42 degrees were awarded in
absentia. A total of 285 bachelor de-
grees including 167 from the college
were granted at today’s rites. Be-
cause of the large number of gradu-
ates, higher degrees were awarded
in the morning ceremonies.

Among the graduates were 51
officers, commissioned in the medical

corps, five veterans of World War II,
and 16-year-old Delores Engel, one
of the youngest graduates in the Uni-
versity’s history.

The University gave a total of 83
masters degrees, 33 bachelors, 15
masters of business administration,
5 bachelors of divinity, 3 doctors of
jurisprudence, 55 medical decrees,
and 32 Ph.D.’s.

Hutchins* address was entitled
“The New Realism” and he slashed
what he called merely a “return to
the old realpolitic.” The greatest
crime of this viewpoint is its in-

Walkout Fails to Dent:

Status Quo At Quad Club

Strike of sixteen student employees at the Quadrangles Club
and a protest demonstration followed close upon rejection of a
set of proposed amendments to the club by-laws at a membership
meeting Monday night.

Claiming that the club had refused
to abandon its policy of racial and
political discrimination, the students,
led by David Carson and Gabriel
Fackre, and joined by twenty other
demonstrators, paraded around the
club for half an hour at noon Wednes-
day brandishing signs protesting a
“tradition of discrimination” and
handed out circulars on the evils of
traditionalism.

The proposed amendments, which
had been recommended by nine mem-
bers, were voted down 182-85. They

called for discard of the present
blackmail privilege on applicants who
were members of the University fac-
ulty or staff, making election auto-
matic in such cases. Another provi-
sion would have made women eligible
to become members.

Although there were rumors that
proponents of the amendments would
resign following their defeat, no res-
ignations had been received up to
yesterday, according to John M. Beal,
club secretary.

A 630-page epoch poem, Tahl, writ-

The young American poetess, now
studying the Chinese language and
culture on a Chinese fellowship, hopes
to augment her work by study in the
Oriental Language department.

She entered the University in the

dence here for at least a year.

William Rose Benet’s citation of
Tahl as “an event in American litera-

221st convocation exercises today, follows in full:

The most distressing aspect of the world into which you are
going is its indifference to the basic issues, which now, as always,
are moral issues. The discussion of the questions on which our
fate turns is not even conducted in moral language. The word
security, which is the great word today, has no moral significance;
for the worst men can, and usually do, want it. The words peace,
justice, co-operation, community, and charity have fallen out of
our vocabulary. They are, in fact, regarded as signs of weakness
and as showing that the one who uses them is guilty of the capital
crime of modern times, lack of realism.

The rise of the new realism was
bound to produce confusion in Amer-
ica; for the new realism is nothing
but the old Realpolitik. It repre-
sents the conquest of the United
States, by Hitler. It suggests that
the one powerful nation in the world
which claimed to hate machiavellian-
ism, and repudiated the doctrine that
military superiority implies moral
superiority must now embrace these
theories or be accused of being “soft.”
A nation which fought two wars to
end war must now, in the hour of
victory, plan to have the greatest
navy in the world; it must have per-
petual conscription, and it must get
all the island bases it can lay its
hands on. A nation which has pre-
tended to the name of Christian must
now abandon the attempt to deserve
it.

Contradictions Attacked

This moral confusion is matched
by intellectual disintegration. We
seem not to see or not to care about
the stupidity of following contradic-
tory policies and taking contradictory
attitudes. Intellectual integrity is
coming to be regarded as a sign of
softness, too.

So we call Japanese soldiers fanat-
ics when they die rather than sur-
render, whereas American soldiers
who do the same thing are heroes.
We prove that all Germans are
murderairs and all Japanese apes,
and at the same time insist that we
are going to have one world in which
all men are brothers. We say we are
going to re-educate the Germans, and
adopt a policy of non-fraternization.
We hate slavery and propose forced
labor. We want Europe rebuilt, but
will have no heavy industry in Ger-
many. We want order in Europe,
but not if we have to sacrifice to pre-
vent starvation. We are against
dictatorship, but the dictatorship of
the proletariat is an exception. And
the new day dawns by the light
of the burning homes of Tokyo and
Yokohama.

Blinded to Own Interests

The new realism is so unrealistic
that it blinds us to our own interests.
We are like those rugged realistic
advocates of the high protective tariff
who propose to export vast quanti-
ties of goods without admitting any
imports to pay for them. To state
the thing in its lowest terms, in
terms of money and power, which
the new realists claim are the only
terms there are, our political and
economic interests require a proper-
ous Germany and Japan. Our in-
terests may, in the light of current
readjustments of power in Europe
and Asia, require a strong Germany
and Japan. But we cannot trade
with those who have nothing to ex-
change. And we cannot be sure that
our present allies will always be our
friends and that we shall not some-
time need the help of our present
enemies. Mr. Churchill must have
regretted in a very short time the un-

THE MAROON will suspend publication during the summer quar-

In the fall quarter, THE MAROON will present a highly ex-

will be possible to advance into a semi-weekly status as a spring-
board to complete reconversion.

No subscriptions for the fall quarter or the academic term of
1945-46 can be accepted until Sept. 1. Applications for staff mem-

wise words he uttered about Russia
five years ago. He said: “Everyone
can see how Communism rots the
soul of a nation, how it makes it
abject and hungry in peace, and
proves it base, abominable in war.”
Adopted Nazi Doctrines

The conquest of the United States
by Hitler is revealed by our adoption
of the Nazi doctrine that certain
races or nations are superior and fit
to rule, whereas others are vicious
and fit only to be exterminated or
enslaved. We are now talking about
guilty races. We are saying about
the Germans and the Japanese what
Hitler said about the Jews. And we
are saying about ourselves—or at
least we are strongly hinting it—
what Hitler said about the blond
teutonic “Aryans.” A graduate of
the University of Chicago told me
that he wished a dense cloud of poison
gas would settle over the Japanese
islands and destroy every man,
woman, and child in them. He had
the grace to add, “Maybe I’m not
a Christian.” Without debating the
Christianity of declaring war on
women and children, I merely point
out the arrogance of the assumption
that any American is fit to judge all
Japanese.

Must Punish Criminals

Hitler’s conquest of America pro-
ceeds apace as we succumb to the
idea that social and political prob-
lems can be most effectively solved
with the aid of a firing squad. I
insist that criminals must be
punished. Justice demands that none
of the guilty escape. At the same
time it must be clear that the char-
acteristic of criminals is that they
are individuals, not nations or races.
They should be punished for what
they individually did. What they
did, to deserve punishment at the
hands of human judges, must have
been illegal at the time it was done.
If the judgement is to command the
respect of Americans, it must be
shown that the act was one which
a patriotic American would not have
committed if he had been a patriotic
German. Punishment for illegal acts
must be meted out legally, with a
fair trial and adherence to the Anglo-
Saxon principle that every man is
presumed innocent until he is proved
guilty. We must remember the
ancient doctrine that no man is a
good judge in his own cause. And
it would do us no harm to apply the
maxim of equality that one must
come into court with clean hands.

We should hesitate to punish Ger-
mans for acts which we have com-
mitted or may commit. For instance,
are we prepared to stand trial our-
selves for the violation of treaties
and attacks on undefended places?
Are we ready to say that in the face
of the tommy guns of the SS we
wpuld have remained true to our
ideals of democracy? Is the standard
the standard of heroes and saints, or

that of the ordinary man, who
throughout the world thinks first of
the lives of his family and second
about his principles? We could wish
that all men were prepared to die
for their principles in peace and in
war. We do not expect Americans
to do it except in war.

US Record Not Spotless

We may hesitate a little to punish
Germans for crimes against Germans
unless we are ready for a foreign
investigation of American crimes
against Americans. I should feel
better about having Americans judge
the anti-semitism and the concentra-
tion camps of Germany if I could
forget the anti-semitism and the
lynchings in the United States. Our
religious and racial intolerance is
unorganized, and violence is sporadic
and illegal. We have not yet gone
in for these things on the grand
Nazi scale. But we are sufficiently
vulnerable to lay ourselves open to
some embarrassment if we set our-
selves to pass judgment on the
domestic conduct of other nations.

Of one crime the German people
were certainly guilty, and that is
the crime which the new realism
sanctifies, the crime of indifference.
The German people, all but a few
million of them, were indifferent to
the rights of man and indifferent to
the violation of these rights by those
in power. If any nation can be found
which is not guilty of this crime,
then it is qualified to judge the Ger-
man people for their indifference to
the crimes committed by Germans
against Germans. As for ourselves,
it is not unfair to say that the
American people, except for a few
million of them, are guilty of the
crime of indifference in the face of
race prejudice, economic exploitation,
political corruption, and the degrad-
ation of oppressed minorities. This
guilt does not assist our claim to
judge and punish the German people
for their.

We all believe today that what was
miscalled “Reconstruction” in the
South after the Civil War was a
blunder, if not a crime. One of the
factors that shaped public opinion
in the North was the revelation of
the treatment of prisoners at Ander-
sonville in Georgia, where, out of
50,000 men, 13,000 died. The South-
erners were then the guilty race.
They must be kept down by military
force until the end of time. They
could not be permitted to rejoin the
society of respectable citizens. Talk
of non-fraternization, of reducing the
South to a subsistence level, and the
punishment of war criminals filled
the air. Every Southerner was
guilty of favoring slavery and re-
bellion, though it was known that
thousands, like Robert E. Lee, had
reluctantly taken up arms only be-
cause they thought it was their duty
to their States.

Reconstruction Botched

Andersonville was an atrocity.
Those responsible for it deserved
punishment. We know now that
Andersonville did not prove the de-
pravity o fthe South. We know that
by acting as though it did the North
hurt itself and delayed the recovery
of the entire country.

Today we are struggling to build
a world community. It is impossible
that 125,000,000 Germans and Jap-
anese can be excluded from it. We
are told that the development of
transportation has brought us as
close to Berlin as Richmond was to
Washington. If this is so, then we
have on an international scale the
same task today that Lincoln had
in 1865. We now believe that his
policy was the right, the realistic,
one. We believe that if that policy
had been followed the national com-
munity would have soon been re-
stored, and years of suffering, which
slid leave their mark upon the na-
tion, would have been avoided. The
new realism is unrealistic, for in
addition to thwarting our own in-
terests, which it falsely pretends to
serve, it ignores all the facts, the
facts of history and the facts of
human nature.

Likens Task to Lincoln's

If the policy of Lincoln is the right,
the realistic, one, and if our task is
the same .is his, the words of the

Wright, BackFrom San
Francisco, Optimistic
Over Future Of League

By JOAN IKOHN

Optimism about the results of the World Security Conference,
and a belief that a charter will be made that will be more satis-
factory than the Covenant of the League of Nations, was expressed
yesterday by Quincy Wright, Professor of International Law here,
who has just returned from San Francisco.

Wright served with a consultants
group, organized by the Depratment
of State from organizations in-
terested in peace problems, which
acted as an advisory committee to
the American Delegation.

In an interview with THE CHI-
CAGO MAROON, Wright said that
all of the important problems have

Honors.,.

Phyllis Helen Tatsch, Elizabeth Anne

For excellence in the school of
medicine ten junior and senior stu-
dents were elected to Alpha Omega
Alpha. They were Loren T. De Wind,
Charles F. Kittle, John 3- Kozy,
George F. Krakowka, Chauncey Car-
ter Maher, Jr., James R. McGrath,
Eugene R. Mindell, Edward H. Senz,
John Adams Sibley, and Jerome Hy-
man Styrt.

The law school nominated Sylvester
J. Petro, Dale M. Stucky, and Selwyn
H. Torff, to the Chicago Chapter of
the Order of the Coif for high dis-
tinction in the professional work of
the law school.

To Lynn McCormick Cummings was
given the Theodore Lee Neff prize
for excellence in the study of French.

First winner of the Political In-
stitutions prize, “The Dilemma of
Democracy,” was Marilyn Winograd
with her essay on “Mass Unemploy-
ment: Stimulation to Fascism.”

Miss Winograd was given a $100
cash gift.

The John Billings Fiske poetry
prize was given to Frank B. Ebersole;
the Chicago Folklore Society award
to Erminie W. Voeglin; The Milo
Jowett Bible Reading gift to William
L. Reese Jr.; the David Blair Mc-
Laughlin prize for excellence in the
writing of English prose to Barbara
Jane Klowden.

Among other awards were the
Elizabeth Susan Dixon commemora-
tive prize to a first-year student in
the school of Social Service Admin-
istration for outstanding work and
promise of future achievement in the
field of Social Work to Eve Heine-

was Elaine May Hockinson.

been resolved and the few issues that
remain are well on the way to settle-
ment.

Wright declares that the Russians
have shown every evidence of will-
ingness to cooperate. The press has
greatly exaggerated the controversy
between the United States and Rus-
sia,” he stated. The biggest contro-
versy, he reports, concerned the ex-
ercise of veto power over discussion,
which was finally settled when Russia
recognized that the veto power did
not apply to discussion.

Admission of Argentina and the
Polish question were the other major
controversial issues. The Argentine
question has of course been settled,
and Wright believes that the Polish
question has been put on the road
to settlement by Harry Hopkin’s
mission to Moscow.

Concerning the problem of United
States leadership, he feels that “the
United States, as represented by the
executive, has accepted its position
as leader, and the public supports
this position. The stumbling block
now is the Senate, which must ratify
the charter by a two-thirds vote.”
Wright is optimistic, however, about
the Senate position which he believes
favorable. The issue is a major one
because the other nations will await
U.S. ratification before making de-
cisions, Wright pointed out.

Wright said he thought it “very
significant” that the Conference was
held at San Francisco. “Because it
is the first general political con-
ference held outside of Europe for
almost 2,000 years, it marks a de-
finite shift of the center of political
weight.” The relative diminution of
European importance is further indi-
cated by the fact that only eight
of the fifty states represented were
European. Twenty-two American
states were represented, as well as
most of the five Arab countries, in
addition to Australia and the rest of
the British dominions and China.

The smaller states made a con-
sistant drive to increase the relative
important of the assembly, and to
strengthen the court and inter-
national law.. They did achieve some
modifications of the Dumbarton Oaks
proposals.

Student Government Plan

A three-member constitutional com-
mittee will outline a charter for a
new student government during the
summer months and will present it
to the student body for referendum
in the middle of the autumn quarter.
Assigned to writing the document
were Stan Tannenbaum, Burton Ros-
ner, and Zonabel Kingeiy.

Hutchins Calls For:

Housecleaning In Divisions;
Three New Research Units

Calling for a thorough house-cleaning of the divisions to
meet the changing needs of education, President Hutchins Satur-
day indicated in his annual message to the alumni that revamping
of the higher education will be one of his major objectives in
the near future.

“The next ten years will be most
critical in history for American
education and for the University,”
Hutchins declared in a 15-minute
address in which he urged revisions
be made in the graduate schools of
the University. He estimated that
over 50 percent of those enrolled in
the higher schools “don’t belong
there.” Hutchins did not elaborate
further on his statement but obser-
vers pointed out that his revision
platform includes twin Ph.D. de-
grees, abolition of the B.S. degree,
and inauguration of a new course
system.

In his message at Mandel Hall he
traced the progress of the University
during the past, announced that 3
new institutes will be initiated as
soon as possible, and revealed that
University expenditures in the next
decade will exceed 65 million dollars.

Institutes in metals, industrial
medicine, and biophysics will be
established.

Earlier the president had accepted
a $220,000 cash gift from the alumni
which included both donations and
bequests.

Thirty-three distinguished alumni
were awarded citations of merit at
the annual assembly. The citation
was established during the Univer-
sity’s 50th anniversity celebration in
1941 in recognition of public serv-
ice to the community, the nation, and
humanity. A total of 218 alumnii
have received the award to date.

Among graduates honored last Sat-
urday were Tomas Confessor, secre-
tary of the interior and mayor of
Manila, who led guerillas against the
Japanese during the occupation of the
Philippines; Fredrick Kuh, London
correspondent for The Chicago Sun
and P.M.; Congresswoman Emily
Taft Douglas; Charles S. Johnson,
internationally famous Negro educa-
tor and sociologist at Fisk University;
Norris C. Rakee, Chief Justice of the
Colorado supreme court; Emery T.

The University Spreads The Gospel

--------------------------- Friday, June 15, 1945

Innuendoes by Armstrong

Robert M. Hutchins is an evangelist by
heart. In recent weeks he has pressed the but-
ton, hurling into action a giant teaching ma-
chine which he hopes in five years may revolu-
tionize American adult education. The boy
wonder of the college program has now spread
his tenacles into that vast unexplored confines
of education beyond the university level.

There are too few who recognize that a uni-
versity’s scope and influence may extend be-
yond the narrow borders of its campus. Those
of yesteryear still cling to the belief that the
major contributions universities make to the
outside world are produced in laboratories and
in test tubes. While it is unquestionably true
that the total of the lives saved thru research
staggers the imagination, universities are
playing an increasingly prominent role in
shaping men’s thinking and in affecting their
every-day pattern of living.

The “great books” theme, which originated
as a revolutionary measure in the colleges, has
now become the spearhead for revamping
adult education. At the current time the Uni-
versity is training 500 community leaders in
the methods of teaching great books to others.
These persons, once trained, will organize small
discussion groups in their respective communi-
ties for the reading and discussion of the great
tomes. In steadily widening concentric circles,
the teaching will spread.

Similarly Washington, New York, and Chi-
cago librarians are being carefully prepared to
instruct the courses.

Of equal interest is the recent pronounce-
ment that Hutchins and a small select staff are
preparing the “100 Great Books of the Western
World” for publication by 1947. The volumes
will be issued by the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
an adjunct to the University, in about three
years and will be complete and unabridged
texts of the classics.

Motivating force behind the expansion in-
to adult education is Hutchins’ long cherished
theory that the great books were written for

Abortive Degree

The Chicago four-year college plan is three
years old this week. That which was once an
educator’s dream is today a reality. The 167
graduates who receive the college bachelor’s
degrees at Friday’s convocation are eloquent
testemony to the success of that program.

A young institution must be in a state of
constant flux and prepared to modify itself.
Thus the alterations in the program as announced
yesterday. But further changes are essential,
and among these we believe abolition of the
Ph.B. degree is a vital measure.

If the content of a liberal education in terms
of curriculum includes certain designated cours-
es, then every student must be required to study
these subjects. If certain courses are not an
integral part to a liberal learning, than a stu-
dent should be eligible for a degree representing
completion of that education without those
courses.

In logic, a contradiction is a signal of defeat.
The Bachelor of Philosophy is a blatant contra-
diction to the college plan. The existence of this
degree implies that two of the fourth-year
courses are not included in the content of a
liberal education. If they are part of that edu-
cation, every student must take them; if they
are not the Bachelor of Arts degree, signifying
the completion of a liberal education should be
granted without them. In either event, the
Ph.B. degree must go by the board.

The college faculty should act speedily to
solve the paradox.

Post-comprehensive days are usually dull, but this year is probably the
dullest. Only a few things have happened such as the incident at the
Huddle when slightly mad residents of Int House, singing native chants,
leaped madly up the tables shouting “Why Stole My Belt?” That wasn’t
all that had been stolen—all the afore-mentioned gentlemen had on were
rolled-up trousers and a copious supply of mud. When asked by the cashier
where they went to school, they shouted gleefully, “University of Chicago—
can’t you tell???” and roared out on their merry way. Speaking of people
on their way to somewhere, we were accosted by an irate alumnus who
demanded of us, “WHERE are my headquarters?”

'Major ProblemsStillConfrouting
Music Critics’--Cecil Smith

Dot 9n Dash Portraits

Stormy Saga of An Evolutionist

By SAMUEL GOLDEN

“Elder Olson and Joe Schwab
are grappling with the basic
problem of music criticism: the
carrying over of things said
technically about music to the
description of music as an art
and expression of feeling. How
to bridge this gap has not been
decided; there is no kind of mu-
sical criticism which has dis-
covered how to move from con-
siderations of the technical di-
rectly to generalizations about
the artistic unity of a work, but
if there were, it would be very
close to Aristotle’s treatment of
the tragedy in the poetics.”

Thus Mr. Cecil Smith, Chairman of
the Department of Music, began a
roundup review of the series of in-
terviews on music appreciation which
have appeared re-
cently in THE
MAROON. Ap-
pearing, in order
in this series were:

Last	Elder Olson, As-
In A	sistant Professor

- .	of English in the

Jeries	College; Joseph

Schwab, Assistant
Professor of the
Biological Sciences
in the College;
Daniel Prescott, Professor of Edu-
cation in the Department of Educa-
tion; and Clarke Kessler, wind
coach and assistant conductor of the
Campus Orchestra.

Smith agrees with Olson that the
focal point of things to be talked
about in a poetics of music would
be music as an imitation—the real
nature of musical form as opposed
to “the type of analysis which deals
simply with external structural de-
vices as though these constituted
musical form. On the other hand,”
Smith continued, “the procedure
employed here by Mr. Olson (refer-
ring in particular to Olson’s example
of Debussy’s La Mer would be too
constricted. Composers frequently
employ the device of analogy. Spas-
modic rhythm and undulating melo-
dies are used to suggest waves; and
thus it is not a case always of ‘di-
rect imitation of the passions’.”
Smith cited other cases in which cer-
tain combinations of sounds were
deliberately put in for their direct

Bigots Lashed
By New Movie
At Playhouse

According to the sheet circulated
by the World Playhouse, its current
film “Mr. Emmanuel” is “too strong
medicine for the narrow-minded, the
bigoted, the peanut brained. This is
a big-hearted, big-souled picture for
big-hearted, big-souled men and wom-
en.”

Mr. Emmanuel, it turns out on ex-
amination, is an elderly English gen-
tleman, and a Jew besides, who is
well known for his philanthropy. He
becomes interested in a transplanted
German youth who, having lost track
of his mother, threatens to commit
suicide. Emmanuel, to prevent this,
promises to go to Germany and locate
her. He arrives, the year is 1938, and
being Jewish, naturally has a hard
time of it. He is accused of murder,
beaten, but is finally released. The
boy’s mother is under the influence of
her new Nazi husband and refuses to

pictorial associations. In order,
therefore, to deal fully with music
as an art, one must be able to show
“all the ways in which it makes
literary or pictorial refrences” in
addition to the imitation of emotions.

In respect to Schwab’s criticism
of Olson on the grounds that music
being made up of sounds, could not
directly imitate the passions, Smith
observes, “The argument wouldn’t
in the least be limited to music. In
the same manner tragedy could not
be an imitation of action because
words are not action (considering
tragedy as an art form that can be
read as well as seen.) This denial
of the theory of imitation is thus ei-
ther true of all the arts, or else it
is simply nonsense; for the very es-
sence of the artist’s problem is the
translation of the objects of imita-
tion into his particular medium, or
else there is no relation whatever
between the so-called objects of imi-
tation and works of art. On the oth-
er hand I agree with Mr. Schwab
that the music itself is what is to

Servin' It Hot

Eleven students and a sponsor, Pro-
fessor William O’Meara of the De-
partment of Philosophy, gathered last
Tuesday in Rosenwald 2 and founded
the University of Chicago jazz club.

Lester Mouscher was elected presi-
dent, this writer vice - president,
Jeanne Schlageter secretary, and
Danny Gerould, treasurer.

The order of business completed,
Professor O’Meara spicing his re-
marks with Aristotle, promptly
launched a discussion of the philo-
sophical basis for jazz criticism. The
general conclusion was that jazz must
be approached shorn of its super-
ficialities (the gin mill traditions etc.)
and in a context of art forms.

The club program will be a varied
one. It will include round table dis-
cussions of records, visiting critics,
record concerts, lectures, cooperation
with other jazz clubs, and campus
jazz sessions.

Only qualifications for membership
are an affiliation with the University
and an interest in jazz. All the per-
sons who fall in this category should
attend the next club meeting Wednes-
day, June 27. Full details will be
posted on the campus bulletin board.

be appreciated and that the great
red herring drawn across the path
of those who want to appreciate mu-
sic is the constant reference to what
a piece of music does to you, as
though the individual psychological
results of music can properly be
supposed to have universal signifi-
cance.”

Mr. Smith did not at all agree
with Mr Prescott’s theories. He
disagreed with what he called the
underlying assumption of Prescott
and most other psychologists that
reactions to any given piece of mu-
sic will be uniform in all listeners.
“This is the kind of assumption
that causes many well meaning mu-
sic therapists to make life miserable
for veterans in hospitals by forcing
music upon them in the firm belief
that it will automatically improve
their morale.”

“I would sum up Mr. Prescott’s
interview as a good illustration of
what music becomes when it is con-
sidered an ‘adjunct to the social sci-
ences’. Individual pieces retain no
meaning within themselves but are
assessed either as psychological in-
struments for producing reactions,
or as typical examples of the al-
leged influence of social groups and
historical periods.” Mr. Smith does
not deny that there is a use of a
psychological approach in music, but
claims that this approach will never
deal primarily with music as an art,
and further, that a psychologist can-
not hope to get scientific and useful
results if he is himself ignorant of
the technique of music.

“Clarke Kessler talked pretty
good sense on the whole. The funda-
mental weakness of his argument is
in identifying the intellectual in mu-
sic solely with the technical. For
him there are but two kinds of listen-
ers, the emotional ones, who do not
understand the technical, and the in-
tellectual, who have a thorough
knowledge of the technical.” Smith
believes a certain amount of technical
knowledge is necessary to the under-
standing of the unity of form of a
piece of music, but certainly not the
professional musicians’ technique.
“But if Kessler means to include all
I do within the range of intellectual
understanding I would agree com-
pletely with him.”

New Orientation Plan

Given Green Light

Three major revisions, all designed to increase the efficiency
of the Orientation program, have been approved by a joint student-
faculty committee and will become effective here with the summer
quarter.

Over 175 students, expected to begin attendance at the Uni-
versity with the summer session, will be processed in a 5-day
program beginning June 21.

The Orientation Board, headed by
Cora Glasner, and Norman F. Mac-
lean, dean of the students in the col-
lege will conduct the introductory ex-
ercises.

Innovations to the summer orienta-
tion curricula which may become per-
manent fixtures include an overnight
stay in the University dormitories by
non-resident students the night of
June 21. Entering men commuters
will be housed in Judson court for
the “get acquainted” session, while
women will occupy Green. A two-
session “how to study seminar” has
also been planned as a permanent
feature. In a morning session on
June 25, Clarence H. Faust, Dean of
the College, will discuss proficiency
in note-taking and in an afternoon
discussion Russell B, Thomas, chair-
man of the Humanities in the College,
will direct an analysis of reading
techniques.

Third feature will be a round table
discussion of the aims of higher
education to be led by President Hut-
chins the evening of June 25 at Jud-
son Court.

Other activities in addition to
placement examinations will include
an activities banquet at Burton Court,
Thursday, June 21, replacing the con-
ventional activities night program at
Mandel Hall; a discussion of the col-
lege’s objectives by Ralph W. Gerard,
Chairman of the College Evaluation

Committee, .on Saturday, June 2^
and a picnic supper at 5 p.m. Sun-
day, June 24, at Burton Court.

have anything to do with her son.
Emmanuel then returns to England,
where his rights are respected, and
straightens things out.

Now this is no startling situation.
As a matter of fact most of the world
has been aware of German discrimina-
tion and brutality since 1935. But
Mr. Emmanuel is an old movie, and
when it was produced, it was, no
doubt, a big step ahead.

Still, for all its flagrant improba-
bilities, and almost constant use of
the main water lines of human senti-
mentality, the film remains enjoy-
able. The acting is flawless, although
subject to the director’s tear wring-
ing technique. Sets and general back-
ground are just about as realistic as
any we’ve seen. Furthermore, Eng-
lish directors have a very relaxing
way of making their “mothers” look
like they’ve been doing something
other than polishing their nails thru
the years. There is, besides all this,
a very fetching sub-plot, which, in
our.opinion, is meat for a good deal
more consideration than was given it.

Tuition Boost Will
Become Effective

Here This Summer

The overall 22.6 per cent in-
crease in tuition and fees will be-'

quarter, starting June 25.

All students in the colleges and
in the divisions will pay $110 tui-
tion and a $20 University fee. The
new law school stipend has been
set at $412.50, and the medical
school at $495.

The increases are designed to

Tahl, as far as it will allow a sum-

THE CHICAGO MAROON

-Page Seven

Maroons Will Resume Big 10 Cage, Baseball
Slates Next Season If Material Available

G-I’s, New Students Boost Hopes;
Administration SupportsProgram

The University of Chicago, founder of the Big 10 confer-
ence and for over 40 years a power in midwest athletics, may
resume conference competition after a one-year wartime layoff
next season, J. Kyle Anderson, acting director of athletics re-

vealed yesterday.

Anderson announced after a series
of conferences with administrative
officials that if sufficient manpower is
available, Chicago will ask Big 10 mo-
guls that it be included in basketball
and baseball schedules. A final deci-
sion will be rendered during the sum-
mer after a survey of playing talent
is completed. Anderson stressed the
necessity for sufficient material as a
pre-requesite to a comeback.

Chicago declined cage and diamond
schedule commitments last season
when the Fieldhouse was engaged by
the army and available manpower
was at its lowest ebb in history. The
temporary withdrawal from the con-
ference was made with the under-
standing, however, that when the fa-
cilities were returned to the Univer-
sity and sufficient playing talent was
available, Chicago would return to
the fold.

Chicago has permanently abandon-
ed inter-collegiate football.

Returning veterans and an addi-
tional influx of civilian students will
bolster both basketball and baseball
squads. The Maroon courtmen split
a 14-game schedule this season and
the baseballmen won two contests in
an 11-game card in non-conference
Play.

Chicago’s withdrawal from their
conference was taken to protect both
the University and the Big 10, An-
derson said, noting that it would have
been impossible to continue basket-
ball after mid-season last winter
when eight naval trainees, the bulk
of the squad, were transferred in Jan-
uary.

If players are available, Chicago
will play about 8 conference basket-
ball games, with home games in the
Fieldhouse. Coach Nels H. Norgren
will again handle the hoop crew.

Rebuilding the athletic dynasty
here will take several years, however,
but Anderson said he believed stu-
dents of the University would support
teams, irrespective of their win-and-
loss status.

Anderson said, in sketching next
year’s program, that the University
would conainue its heavy emphasis
of intra-mural sports.

“The German people were

violation of these rights by

a guilt

indiff er-
and the
those in

power.” he declared, “but the Ameri-
can people except for a few million
are guilty of the crime of indifference
in the face of race prejudices, econo-
mic exploitation, political corruption,
and the degradation of oppressed
minorities.”

Hutchins denounced the conquest
of the United States by Hitler which
he said “was evident by our adoption
of the Nazi doctrine that certain
races or nations are superior and fit
to rule whereas others are vicious and
fit only to be exterminated or en-
slaved.”

He asserted that justice demands
that the guilty shall not escape.
“But if the judgment is to command
the respect of Americans it must be
shown that the act was one which a
patriotic American would not have

committed if he
German.”

to an anology com-

paring the world of today to that of
the plight of the south at the end of
hostilities in the Civil War. He said
that atrocity stories misguided the
nation then as now, and it was evident
then as it should be today that “no
nation can exist divided.” “We can-
not possibly exclude the 125 million
Germans and Japs from the world
community,” he proclaimed.
