[Features Premiere of New Work

Hans Lange

The highlight of tonight’s Compos-
ers’ Concert at Mandel Hall will be
the world'premiere of Alexander Tana-
man’s Divertimento, written especially
for this series sponsored by the Uni-
versity’s Department of Music. This
work written for oboe, clarinet, trum-
pet, ’cello and piano will be performed
under the direction of Hans Lange,
eminent conductor and Director of
Intrumental Music at the University.
The instrumentalists in Tansman’s
new composition will be Florian Muel-
ler, Robert Lindemann, and Jerry
Huffman, first desk man from the
Chicago Symphony; Ernest Fried-
lander, ’cellist of the Pro Arte Quar-
tet; and Miss Dorothy Walters, pian-
ist.

The program, the fourth in the
series under the direction of Remi
Gassman, will also include Bartok’s

String Quartet No. 5, Stravinsky’s
Elegie for Viola Alone- Malipiero’s
Rispetti e Strambotti, and Hindemith’s
Sonata for Trumpet and Piano.

The Bartok quartet, which is dedi-
cated to Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coo-
lidge, and the Malipiero work will be
performed by the Pro Arte Quartet
of the University of Wisconsin. Ris-
petti e Strambotti, written in one
movement, represents two ancient
forms of Italian poetry. Germain
Prevost, violist of the quartet, will
play the Elegie, a new work, which is
dedicated to Prevost. The composition
is to be played in memory of Alphonse
Onnou, founder and, until his death,
first violinist of the group.

The concert will begin at 8:30 p.m.,
as usual, and tickets may still be
obtained in the box office in Mandel
Hall.

A Dubious Distinction

Choir Will
Sing Downtown

On Thursday, March 29 at 8:15,
and Friday, March 30 at 2^5, the
University of Chicago Choir will ap-
pear with the Chicago Symphony Or-
chestra in Orchestra Hall. The pro-
gram, which is on the orchestra’s
regular series, will feature the choir
in three excerpts from the St. Matthew
Passion of Bach: the chorus O Man
bewail thy grievous sin, the chorale
When life begins to fail me, and the
closing double chorus Here yet awhile.
The chorale will be sung a capella.

The program, under the direction
of Hans Lange, will also include the
following purely orchestral numbers:
The chorale-prelude A Mightly For-
tress is our God and the Sinfonia to
Church Cantata Ich steh mit einem
Fuss in Grabe (I stand with one foot
in the grave), by Bach; and Bin
Heldenleben (A hero’s life), by Rich-
ard Strauss.

The choir has been preparing for
these programs under its director, Ger-
hard Schroth.

Hutchins, Gottesman, Big 3
Receive Honary Doctorates

the

The Chicago Boswell Institute, famed far and wide as
zaniest collection of literary (and otherwise) screwballs ever
assembled under one charter, this week created a new nationwide

Seven U of C

Students Bid

To Phi Bote

Seven University students

were

elected to Phi Beta Kappa, according
to an announcement issued by the
Beta of Illinois chapter this week.
The high ranking students who won
the award from among those who
graduate this quarter are Kenneth
Marion Campions, Department of
Anatomy; John Thomas Grayback,
Department of Anatomy; Allan Le-
vente Lorincz, Department of Phy-
siology; Helen Elizabeth Wallace, De-
partment of Psychology; June
Rachuy, Department of English;
Richard Raymond Carlson, Depart-

honorary degree—Doctor of Worldly Wisdom—and promptly
awarded it to President Robert M. Hutchins and Chicago Maroon
editor, Fred Gottesman.

Hutchins, in accepting the degree,
unique in the world of letters, wrote
the club founder, Jean Jacques Rous-
seau Van Voorhies, that “the thing
I need most is the art of worldly
wisdom.” “I shall sit up all night to
read it through,” Hutchins said of
his Latin scroll.

Last summer, after President
Hutchins had been granted the Insti-
tute’s Doctor of Frustration degree,
along with some other distinguished
men of the University, Hutchins in-
vited the Boswell group to set up on
the Midway as a college. The offer
was accepted, hence the promptness
with which the newly created degree
was awarded to University people.

The Chicago Boswells are pattern-
ed after the original London Boswell
Club, initiated to honor James Bos-
well, whose biography of the pon-
derous Cham, Samuel Johnson, 18th
century literary genius, has become
one of the world’s biographical clas-
sics. Johnson, author of a “Dic-
tionary of the English Language,”
together with Oliver Goldsmith, Sir
Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke,
and David Garrick, were original
members of the pocund group nearly
200 years ago-

Avowed purpose of the present day
Boswellians is the annihilation of all
bores and the.stamping out of all
stuffiness. “Pretense of any form is

October 1, 1944 and August 31, 1945.

high school or completed one term

The exam in April is for boys who
will be assigned to the program in
July, August, or September of 1945.

ed Reserve Corps. They are not on
active duty, so do not receive regular
Army pay. Depending on age, appli-
cants will be enrolled for 2, 3. or 4

active duty at the end of the term in
which they reach their 17th birth-

Chicago Enters North Central

College Indoor Track Meet

Coach Ned Merriam is taking a 12 man squad to the North
Central College Invitational indoor track meet, scheduled to take
place at North Central College, Naperville, Illinois, tomorrow.
A probable entry list of nine other schools besides Chicago will
include the host school, Wheaton, Lawrence, Beloit, lillinois Tech
of Chicago, Morton College, Monmouth, Elmhurst and Ripon.

The University thinclads have
already met and defeated Morton
and North Central in previous
dual meets but most of the other
entries are unknown quantities to
Merriam. The relay teams of
Lawrence, North Central, Wheat-
on and Monmouth were entered
in the Chicago Relays matched
races, Wheaton winning one relay
and Lawrence placing second in
the other.

V-12 Helps Some Schools
Lawrence, Beloit, IIT and Ripon all
should turn in strong performances,
each school having large Navy V-12
Units from which they can draw ma-
terial. With a probable five places in
each event, the possibilities of the
meet being very close between three
or four schools is highly probable.

Led by newly elected Captain
Paul Russell, the Maroon travel-
ing squad will include John Bok-
man and Howard Bell in the half
mile, Dinklelocker in the sprints
and broad jump, Sjoersma in the
shot and pole vault, Fischer in
the relay and hurdles and Stack-
bridge in the 880. Coach Merriam
will name the remaining members
of the squad who -will make the
trip today.

Chicago is weakened by the tempor-
ary loss of Albert Friedlander and
Bob Turtelotte who have found it
impossible to go with the squad, but
Merriam believes he has an able dash
man to replace Turtelotte in Dinkle-
locker. This represents the Maroon’s
seventh track meet of the indoor sea-
son with the record standing at 2
wins and three defeats and the Ma-
roon’s hapless participation in the Big
Ten Match.

Baseball to Begin
Around Mid-April

While the Chicago Baseball team
will not compete in the Big Ten con-
ference this season, Coach Kyle An-
derson disclosed this week that nego-
tiations are under way for scheduling
games with Big Ten teams and other
smaller universities.

The season begins around the
15th of April with a strong first team.
An airtight infield seems to be shap-
ing up, the outfield looks good, and
the hurling staff and backstop posi-
tions are ably filled. Already the
boys have been outdoors for practice,
and if the weather holds up. will soon
start to play regularly on the Green-
wood field.

Jack Hill

Time In

We saw the Chicago Relays at the
Stadium last Saturday .eve and aside
from the slightly better performances
in most events we believe that the
recent Big Ten meet at the Field-
house was equally as good. The ar-
rangements for the dashes and
hurdles at the relays kept every eye
on the lanes but other than that, it
was 50-50.

Gunder the Wunder Hagg looked
slightly nonplussed at the rude el-
bowing which is so common on a
narrow board track, and Hagg’s long
stride seemed chopped down some for
the boards. He didn’t look like the
same runner we saw at Soldier’s Field
two years ago but according to the
experts he should develop on the wood
circle. It seems only right that he
should, having come from Sweden
with the terrific build-up that he did.

Even though Lidman, the hurdler,
didn’t hurdle, he was having a fine
old time for himself autographing the
girl relay team’s autograph books.
They were the giggly type and he cer_
tainly didn’t look like the proverbial
sober, silent Swede.

The Maroon baseball team is work-
ing out every chance that the weather
gives them. It would encourage both
Kyle and his men if you wandered
around to take a look at them in
practice. Right now they are behind
the Fieldhouse but as soon as the
grounds are ready they expect to
move over to the Woodlawn field.

Some of the boys look very good
and Anderson has an optomistic view-
point if the team can finish with
anywhere near the number of men
it will start the season with. Chicago
could field a fine nine man team at
the present time but the squad still
lack depth in places and until the
weak points are filled in, Coach An-
derson wil be cagy about who the
Maroons will play.

granted the degrees of Sapientiae
Mundanae Doctor (Doctor of Worldly
Wisdome) simultaneously with the
announcement that the titles had been
conferred on Hutchins and Gottes-
man.

All members of the club adopt
names of 18th century literarians who
were members of the original circle.
Hence, the scroll is signed by both
Johnson and Boswell.

Degrees of Doctor of Frustration
were also awarded to Maroon Busi-
ness Manager, Alan J. Strauss; Man-
aging Editor, Abe Krash, and poet
and critic, John Harmon- The de-
gree was also granted to William
Wambaugh, ex-music critic of the
newspaper. George Hilton, author
of the “Guide to the Befuddled” was
awarded the frustration degree a year
ago along with Editor Gottesman.

Qualifications for either degree are
tucked deep in the fun-loving cere-
bral hemispheres of Van Voorhies,
who is midwest representative for
the Macmillan publishing house. .

Most of the members of the Chi-

Frederick I. Gottesman

stitute, prefer to be cloaked by anony-

the city’ leading educators and news-

Letters to Editor

Increase Student Wages to Meet
Tuition Raise, Student Suggests

To the Editor:

Concerning the prospective tuition increase, I should like to
suggest that it will bear hardest on me part-time student who
also works in order to support himself and pay his school expenses.
If the student is now carrying one course, his total fees (not
counting laboratory courses) come to $41.00. In the fall, he will
owe the bursar a total of $60.00, almost a 50% increase. That
represents a disproportionate increase on the group that is perhaps
the least able to bear it.

Federal Aid to Education

Last week’s action of the Board of Trustees in raising tuition
brings into sharper focus the plight of not only this University,
but all similar privately endowed institutions the country over.
To a certain extent, the condition that most universities find
themselves in today is a direct result of government fiscal action.
The huge debt, with its subsequent affect on money conditions,
has served to lower interest rates to such a level that university
income decreases sharply even while endowment increases.

By this time, it should be apparent to any thinking person
that education, so far as its real value to the community is con-
cerned, must consist of more than mere vocational training. Voca-
tional training is only of individual benefit, inasmuch as it prepares
the individual to participate successfully in the economic life of
the community and to find necessary economic security. But this
is of negative communal value, since failure to possess economic
security makes the individual a communal liability, while posses-
sion of this security does not necessarily mean a communal asset.

However, the perpetuation of our democratic system demands
more than the ability to gain economic security. It requires an
enlightened, informed and aware citizenry, who are capable of
exercising the reasonable and necessary responsibilities of that
citizenship. These qualifications can be attained only through
education. The universal desire for a happier and fuller existence
in a better world cannot be satisfied by training on that primal
vocational plane alone; it must be achieved by the broadening of
intellectual horizons, the leit-motif of liberal college education.

The lesson to be learned may be gathered in part from the
English education system. To be applied to this country, it would
require the following: 1) the creation of a Secretary of Education
on equal footing with other federal cabinet posts; 2) standardiza-
tion of entrance requirements and exams; 3) federal subsidies to
students based on need and achievements in the national exams;
and 4) the power to maintain minimum educational standards in
all college level institutions, public or private.

Dispelling Confusion

The student government plan lights its fifth candle this
month. And after 22 weeks of an endless barrage of drenching
the campus with publicity, the plan is bogged down amid petty
details, personality feuds, and an amazing hesitancy to assume
the freedom of action.

The candle flickered a bit more brightly this week. In clear-
cut and incisive fashion, Dean of Students Lawrence Kimpton
pierced the rampant clouds that have enveloped the plan and set
forth the first line of action. It is, of course, a tentative and
temporary affair but it marks one of the most significant actions
yet taken. For it is a material, concrete step toward attaining the
goal of a student body opinion organ.

Proposed is a six-man committee, to be chosen from interested
students, to confer periodically with the administration, to air
joint problems, and to discuss the further ing of more cordial and
more beneficial relations between the administration and faculty
and the student body.

Dean Kimpton punctured half a dozen of the rumors swarming
about the plan. It will not control the University purse strings;
it will not launch a compaign to purge the campus of fraternities;
it will not hire and fire the faculty. But it will carry to the
faculty and to the administration recommendations, grievances,
and the aspirations of the students.

Of equal import, however, is that the committee be a highly
representative group. It should be constantly reminded that it
is temporary and tentative. Above all it must not be permitted
to descend to the level of another pressure group or clique.

The campus has seen entirely too much of that brand of
pseudo-liberalism in recent weeks. It has had its fill of it. A little
less flaming talk and a little more action appears to be the order
of the day.

Since that is the state of affairs and
it is perhaps too optimistic to expect
any changes on that point, I would
like to suggest that, in accordance
with the tuition and to help the poorer
students remain in school and still
keep a liaison between body and soul,
the campus wages for students be
materially increased.

It has also been stated that the
increase in scholarship grants would
more than offset the tuition increase.
Yet a 15% burst in enrollment is
expected (although some of the new
students will be ex-servicemen), and
scholarships will be granted to only
350 more students. Therefore, it
seems to me that an expanded and
overhauled scholarship program
should be launched.

In re: Art Critics

To the Editor:

When people take it upon them-
selves to become critics, they, of nec-
essity stick their necks out. I’ll give
anyone credit for this much courage,
but when this courage becomes blind
one often sticks one’s neck into a
noose as I believe the Chicago Maroon
art critic has done in her article con-
cerning the etchings of John Sloan.
It is useless for me or anyone to
dispute Miss Harmon’s taste, for if
she is unable to appreciate the value
of Mr. Sloan’s work it is her own loss.
However, in her interpretation of Mr.
Sloan’s views and the meanings of his
pictures, I feel that the critic has
grossly misrepresented the artist. At
the lecture given by Mr. Sloan at
Mandel Hall before the opening of
the exhibit I believe he made it very
explicit that he was opposed to nation-
alism in art or extreme nationalism
of any kind. He has done only Amer-
ican scenes for the simple reason that
he has never been out of the country
to see any other scenes. The impres-
sion I received after seeing the exihbit
was that Mr. Sloan wished to express
the American life of his generation
as he felt it in a manner which can
be understood by the layman. If Miss
Harmon would condemn this I am
afraid that I for one fail to understand
her attitude. It appears to me that
your critic is judging the art of two
generations past in terms of the art
of her own generation and due to her
ethnocentrism is blind to the real
value of the work.

George D. Armstrong

Universality in art does not presup-
pose a Cook’s Tour of the world. The
“scenery” pictured by the artist is
of little importance—the manner and
spirit is our concern. When th^S
spirit evidences itself in bending to
the cliches of the layman on the New
Yorker level, we have reason to be
critical, B^N, H,

Staff members of The Chicago
Maroon will meet at 3:15 on Tues-
day afternoon in Lexington 5 to
elect an editor to succeed Frederick
I. Gottesman. Gottesman has edi-
ted the paper since March, 1944,
will resign at the end of this
quarter.

Lost and Found Dept.

To the Editor:

On Thursday, March 15, I lost a
notebook either in the 10 o’clock lec-
ture in Social Science III at Oriental
Institute or in the Physical Sciences
III lecture in Kent 106 at 11 o’clock.
It contains all my winter quarter’s
work. Due to my carelessness I can
take my quarterly exams armed only
with bravado; next quarter I shall
have to re-do all that work in prep-
aration for the comprehensive exams
in June. The notebook contains a
complete set of Social Science III
notes for this quarter, besides all my
work in my other subjects.

As soon as I discovered the note-
book was missing, I began searching
for it- With the kind help of my
housemother and my advisor, I have
used every means we could collective-
ly think of to recover it. No “Lost
and Found” has it; someone probably
picked it up in one of the lecture
halls, thinking it of no value. I re-
fuse to believe that anyone could
purposely keep something so essen-
tial to any student.

The publishing of this letter is my
last hope. I realize full well that
the loss of a notebook seems trivial
in such times as these. Yet the fact
that it has not been returned is a
critical comment on campus honesty.

I shall be very grateful to you for
publicizing my loss. I offer a reward
of $5 to anyone returning the note-
book- It is large, 3 ringed, and of
blue cloth; my name and address are
in it in many places.

Very truly yours,

Otto went intellectual last week,
demanding that we tell you about
something well worth serious men-
tion, the Encyclopedia Britannica
Collection of Contemporary Amer-
ican Painting. So, although we will
not overflow into other fields and
pass ourselves off as art critics, we
would like you to know what is going
on in Chicago besides chewing.

The editor and art director of the
aforementioned, Messrs. Xust and
Price have gathered what is in their
estimation, “the most complete and
representative collection of contem-
porary American paintings ever as-
sembled.” 116 paintings were chosen
to represent the field, and their origin
is quite interesting.

When Britannica ordered paintings
from well known artists to illustrate
a new edition, the assembled works
suggested extending the project to
form a collection to be toured
throughout the U.S. Staff members
noted a growing interest among the
office workers.

While arrangements were being
made, the pictures were displayed in
Britannica’s offices, atop Chicago’s
Civic Opera Bldg. Here we found

As we were wandering home one night after the documentary
film, we found on the corner of 57th and University a program for
March 28, 1916, of the Ballet Russe. Why it was there we’ll
probably never know—perhaps some professor was discarding
tattle-tale remnants of his love life—but it was fascinating reading
for balletomanes and commoners like us. For example, there is
a classic ad for the “Safe” Arsenic Complexion Wafers—“They
work slowly but surely and the results are guaranteed.” (In case
you’re wondering what that head means, it’s Before the Pure
Food and Drug Act.)

In Classics 20 a sedate little notice was posted telling of the program of
the next meeting; next day, bemused members saw a placard announcing
that Professor Wolfgang Kurt von Fisselfasset would speak on some out-
landish topic and that after the meeting beer would be served at Franz’s
at four o’clock.

Their Hearts are Young and Gay

Nowadays, it seems that the way to impress young ladies is to give a
fencing exhibition along University in front of the girls’ dorms—several of
our confirmed window-peekers were courted in this fashion last week. Some
of our kid sisters played American Legion the other day—out of their sixth
floor window they began straying bottles of water all over innocent passers-
by, many of whom attend the University and probably needed the bath.

Mrs. Walters, head of Blake Hall, was feted this week—she’s leaving

it? Mary Ellen Norcross is taking a quarter off and will be in New York

Now that your basketball charley horses are almost gone and you’re

Flowers That Bloom

Wednesday afternoon some of our flower lovers were seen tying paper
dogwood blossoms on the bushes in front of Cobb- They were charmnig
flowers, calculated to fool even the most expert botanist, and as such deserved
a better fate than that they received at the hands of B & G’s ever vigilant
men. A few hours after the flowers had been painstakingly fastened on,
B & G was found just as painstakingly unfastening them.

Gossip "

Emmy Orth of Gates Hall is sporting a fraternity pin. Bob Jones left
us Tuesday for the Merchant Marine. Cigarette moochers on campus are
now trying the Lauren Bacall approach (we must say that on men it just
doesn’t look good)- People who passed their comps are still throwing post-
comp parties (which may explain the dark circles and dissipated looks that
ordinarily don’t result from mere comprehensives). The Experimental
Theater showings in April promise to be as successful as their previous plays.
A gay time was had by all at the Quarterly Quandr’y—the floor show, we
hear, was excellent. ♦ ♦ ♦

Campus Women

As we were lazily strolling across the quadrangles a while ago, we
became engrossed in the personalities of the people we passed. Of course,
the number of men was negligible so we ruefully concentrated on the gentler
sex. As you go up to Harper to meet one of your friends, you are sure to
find several of the species studiosa. Ordinarily they are distinguished by
the glasses, pre-occupied look, and the stack of books; their natural surround-
ings are Harper or Classics (we except the Fellow’s Corner where people of
an entirely different stripe are found). Occasionally they are seen at some
of the more serious of the documentary films and almost always show up
at concerts to listen learnedly to Bach-

A much different type is the W.A.A. girl, known on other campuses as
the hockey girl. She’s usually tall and brawny with a “shingle” permanent.
Her habitat is the Ida Noyes gym and whatever time she isn’t playing basket-
ball she spends in the locker room comparing athletic exploits with others
of her tribe.

The activities woman is found all over campus (she earns her title by
being present at everything). Her one aim in life is to be known as a
BWOC- Ordinarily she’s a very nice girl—and then she begins to play
politics and get herself maneuvered into choice positions in student activies.
She’s the one who knows everyone and knows just the person to see if you d
like to get on Student Publicity Board or the like.

Definitely opposed to the activities woman is the earnest socialist type.
She’s quite anti-social—speaks only to a chosen few who are working for
The Cause. Of course, few people would speak to her, for she dresses as
she believes the proletariat should and often does not wash herself or her
hair for weeks (no good reason for that) and talks in speeches.

A Guide To The Befuddled

George Hilton

(Ed, note. This is the first of a
short series of interviews with certain
members of the faculty, whose love
and knowledge of music well enables
them to talk about the meaning and
interpretation of musical works.
Others to appear in future issues will
include Mr. J. J. Schwab, well known
assistant professor of Biological Sci-
ences in the College.')

Elder J. Olson, assistant professor
of English in the College, is excep-
tionally well qualified to talk about
music interpretation. His work in
the general field of criticism of the
arts is very familiar to all Humanities
3 students; he is also very interested
in music. His particular composer
preferences run to Chopin, whom
he considers an intimate friend, and
Beethoven, “titanic—too much of a
genius to consider close to oneself”.

To the question, what is it in music
that we enjoy. Mr. Olson’s views can
prove very illuminating. “In the past
nearly all music criticism has dealt
merely with harmonic and melodic
structure. This type of criticism—
call it rather grammatical analysis—
can never hope to explain the meaning
of music. For music is essentially a
depiction of something, just as the
other arts are, and harmony and
melody are simply the means toward
this depiction.” .

But what is it that is depicted in
music? Surely not lines or geometric
figures, for these are not accessible
to music’s particular medium, sound.
Here Mr. Olson gave an abbreviated
account of the origin of music in prim-
itive rhythm, tracing it through the
differentiation of tones and intensity
of tone. It is seen that music “imi-
tates directly the passions”, that is,
the peculiar character of music is that
there is no interposition of anything
between the object and emotions. Thus
it is not the sea that is described in
Debussy’s “La Mer”, but feelings
aroused in Debussy on looking at the
sea. And a different “program”, that
is description from which the emotions
were aroused, would be permissible
if it resulted in the same quality of
emotion. He cites Schumann’s analy-
sis of Chopin’s la ci darem la mano
Variations as an instance of program
generalization affording a clue to
musical “form” in this sense.

It is then seen that the form of a
work could be differentiated on an-
other than a purely technical basis,
for example, a particular Chopin pre-
lude differs from an etude not only
because the former is a sort of in-
troduction and the latter an exercise,
but because they have different emo-
tional qualities. A good work would
then be one whose emotional qualities
(moods) are of a genuine nature, and
follow each other in a probable way.

tests will be given at 3:00 p.m.,

THE REPUBLICAN HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES

Chapter XV

The Civil War was caused by a theory for the abolition of
slavery proposed by Stephen Douglas. He believed that all slaves
who could escape as far as certain Atlantic Coast cities should
be emmancipated. This was known as Douglas’ Free Port Doctrine.
The citizens of Charleston resented having their city made a free
port and held a demonstration in protest. The war became a
reality when several shots were fired at a Northern army officer
named Fort Sumpter.

Lincoln decided that the War should
be waged by starving the rebels. To
this end he issued his famous Em-
maciation Proclamation. To cut off
the South’s food supply, Lincoln or-
dered Sherman to capture Atlanta.
Here the South kept its entire food
supply, consisting of some live stock
and several barrels of flour locked in
an enclosure. Sherman was ordered
to capture the enclosure, lock, stock,
and barrel. The enclosure was guard-
ed by a Southern belle whom Sherman
apparently knew, because he made his
famous statement to her, “We’re
marching through, Georgia.” On the
inside of the enclosure Sherman found
all the food he expected, plus several
dressed rabbits lying on the sofa.
Because they did not look especially
fresh, Sherman issued his decree
“Touch not a hare on yon day bed.”

short stories excitingly far from
the usual watery, tired style of
today.

For anyone interested in a positive
plan of active participation in de-
mocracy—as opposed to the more
sluggish arm - chair variety,
GEORGE B. de HUSZAR’S “PRAC-
TICAL APPLICATIONS OF DE-
MOCRACY” is meaty and re-
alistic/

Frankly feminine and in the lighter
vein is BERYL WILLIAMS’
“FASHION IS OUR BUSINESS”
—fun to read for anyone who loves
clothes or with designs on a career
in fashion.

MAX SEYDEWITZ’ “CIVIL LIFE
IN WARTIME GERMANY” is a
documented, sound, intelligent ex-
position of the mind and temper of
the German people—a synthesized
picture that will help the American
reader to evaluate the odd and
stray bits of information that come
his way.

Piquant and picaresque as ever,
ARTHUR TRAIN’S “MR. TUTT
FINDS A WAY” is his fourteenth
book about the oldest living char-
acter in American fiction—full of
wisdom and humor. You’ll find the
shrewd, great-hearted old lawyer I
at his best in these refreshing ad-
ventures.
