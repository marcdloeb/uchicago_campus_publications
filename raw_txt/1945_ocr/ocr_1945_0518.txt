Hutchins Slashes Peace Draft

Robeson Pleads: Vision, Equality

Charges Conscription Cost Higher

Than Total Spent for Education

By RUTH WACHTENHEIM

At a protest meeting Wednesday, the political
action committee of the Labor Rights Society
passed a resolution assailing the adoption of
peacetime military conscription at this time.
University President Robert M. Hutchins, and

Wynant Kult, international repre-
sentative of the United Auto Workers
(C.I.O.), both condemned the measure
set for a hearing before the House
Military Affairs Committee June 4.

“It would cost from two to three
and four billion dollars, or more than
the entire cost of the nation’s educa-
tional system,” Hutchins pointed out,
emphasizing that the cost of training
men is greater than the cost of their
complete education.

“If youth by 17 are unhealthy, im-
moral, undemocratic, one year will
not alter that status. If we want
health, morals and democracy, we
should start earlier and do more.”

“If military conscription is neces-
sary, we must have it,” he agreed,
“but if we have a large army, it
shows that we have lost the war.
Are we free from fear if we need a
million boys to fight? Whom are we
going to fight and when ? We are the
richest, wealthiest, strongest nation
in the world.”

“If we conscript men, then let us
conscript Science, industry, wealth,”

Popular Star Feature of Rally
Endorsing 'Frisco Peace Plan

dete equality.”

Robeson spoke to a capacity crowd
which filled Mandel Hall for an all-
campus peace rally planned and spon-
sored by a student committee.

An important feature of the meet-
ing was the adoption of a statement
concerning the Conference, prepared
by a student committee, and sent to
the American Delegation at San
Francisco.

Robeson opened by singing folk
tunes from different lands to illustrate
his deep feeling that the nations of
the world, having songs in common,
must be in accord on other essential
things. It is this conviction, in part,
which leads him to believe that
“they’re going to get somewhere out
in San Francisco”. His songs, and the
address that followed were inter-
rupted with applause.

Throughout his talk, which was de-
livered extemporaneously, Robeson
emphasized that the threat of fascism
is ever present and must be combat-
ted, not by “an elite leading the dumb
masses to freedom”, which is a fascist
ideal, but by the entire peoples of the
world today, who “will not be denied.”
He warned that we must not be sway-
ed by those people in our midst who
are trying to confuse us on the issue

of unity; “if we had no unity
would not be winning the war.”

Machinery for handling ex-GI’s has
already gone into action on a com-
paratively small scale in connection
with the 127 veterans who are now
registered on the Quadrangles.

University officials said yesterday
that adequate classroom and teaching
facilities will be available but that
housing will constitute the critical
problem. They disclosed that an ex-
tensive investigation of GI educa-
tional problems has been made here
and that the University is prepared

Net $220 in First
Day of Tag Drive

Stationed at fifteen points through-
out the campus despite an all-day
downpour, University club women and
fraternity men solicited contributions
amounting to $220 for the University
of Chicago Settlement Wednesday.
Final results of the Settlement’s an-
nual drive for funds, which continued
Thursday also, will be tabulated to-
day, officials have announced.

A fast moving expansion in enroll-
ment of ex-veterans is expected here
as the army and navy demobilization
program moves into full swing, ac-
cording to the Office of Admissions.

Zens L. Smith, an assistant dean
of students, will administer the GI
Bill of Rights in his capacity as Coun-
sellor to Veterans, while Robert C.
Woellner, executive secretary of the
Board of Vocational Guidance and
Placement, will direct administration
of Vocational Rehabilitation Law 16.

Irrespective of previous degrees all
veterans enrolling at the University
will be required to take the same
placement tests as those now given
all entering students and will be clas-
sified accordingly. The tests will
eliminate the confusion arising from
the tabulation of credits and will
reflect actual knowledge and intellec-
tual maturity gained by a veteran
while in the service. The new ad-
mission requirement is also based on
fears previously enunciated by Uni-
versity solons that government sub-
sidized education will result in a
lowering of academic standards.

Under the GI Bill of Rights a vet-
eran is entitled to 1 year of educa-
tional training if he was in active
service 90 days and if he has been
honorably discharged. A veteran who
has spent more time in active service
than 90 days is permitted to continue
his studies in direct ratio to the total
period of lais service. This educa-
tional grant, according to terms of
the GI bill, must be used within two
years of his discharge and must not
exceed three years of study.

Academic necessities of GI students
are cared for through a $500 govern-
ment tuition allowance every 3 quar-
ters and a $50 non academic allow-

Correspondence courses for the
blind, the first at college level to be
offered anywhere, are being opened
by the home study department of
the University in cooperation with
the Hadley Correspondence School
for the Blind, of Winnetka, HL, it
was announced yesterday.

In its cooperative arrangement
with the University of Chicago, the
school will set up in braille all the
reading matter, including syllabi

New Government Scheme Set

By ZONABELLE KINGERY

Sweeping reorganization of the various com-
mittees acting for the formation of a student
government was made this week when the com-
mittee of 55 dissolved six overlapping and non-
functioning sub-groups.

Abolishing the six groups will eliminate much of
the confusion in authority and clear the decks for large
scale planning during the summer.

A four-man committee will be named this week by
chairman Bill Washington, to study constitutions from
other colleges and universities in the country, determine
the possible functions of student organization here and
draft a constitution (or alternative constitutions) for
a referendum to the student body in the fall.

The dormitory-commuter committee of 55 will sus-
pend all meetings until fall when the concrete sugges-
tions of the study group will be ready for presentation.

Continuing its work as a means of communication
between the Dean of Students and the student body, the
temporary committee of 7 will devote its time to dir

cussing the problems of the student community and
making recommendations. Appointed during the last
week of March this group has met regularly with Dean
Lawrence A. Kimpton. Among the items on their agenda
are problems of commuting students, returning veterans,
the advisory system, the residence program and student
publications.

The first two sessions were devoted to defining the
aims of the College and of liberal education.

Meeting with Kimpton and Milton Mayer, of the
Office of Public Relations, the group has currently been
evaluating and revising the orientation program for
entering students. Shifting the emphasis of orientation
from the social to the academic attitude is the purpose
behind minor changes being made in the summer Ori-
entation Program. If the measures instituted are en*
couraging, more complete changes will be made during
the fall program.	_

Need for some form of student organization""was
brought to the attention of the Quadrangles last winter

Inter-Fraternity Council, in
revisions affecting nearly every
article of their 1937 Constitu-
tion, Wednesday modernized the
campus set-up to meet present
and future needs on the Quad-
rangles. Six active fraternities
voted unanimously in favor of
the amendments at the regular
I-F meeting.

Chief revisions cut the number of
officers from five to three, entitled
fraternities to membership without
having a house on campus, and made
all actions of the council binding on
the individual houses. The new exec-
utive committee has lost its power
to select the officers to the repre-
sentatives in general meeting, retain-
ing only only the power to make
nominations.

The change in qualifications for
membership in the council added the
clause requiring all members to have
national affiliations and kept the
clause calling for recognition by the
University authorities.

Any action now passed by a major-
ity of the council must be followed
by all member fraternities. To allow
complete house acquiescence to any
action, conditional voting, with a
binding vote to be submitted at the
next meeting, is allowed by the new
constitution. A motion must now be
passed by a majority of the binding
votes or else referred to the next
meeting to be voted upon.

Several other minor amendments
are also included in the revised con-
stitution.

Reynold's Club Reconversion Under Way

The Reynolds Club, occupied
by the Department of Meteor-
ology since March of 1943, is
now being reconverted for stu-
dent use. This former men’s
club, similar to Ida Noyes Hall,
though on a smaller scale, had
been cleared at the departure of
military units from the campus.

The Office of Dramatic Productions
has had possession of the theater since
the beginning of the Spring quarter.
The remainder is now vacant. The
instrument laboratory in the base-
ment is the only section the Army
will retain.

Lawrence A. Kimpton, Dean of Stu-
dents, hopes to have the club com-
pletely re-equipped for the Autumn
quarter. He is not certain whether it
will be returned to the students as a
men’s club with recreational facilities
as formerly, or the quarters will be
put to some other use. Plans are at
present under study.

Actual class programs for all vet-
erans will be planned by the same
advisors as those who now counsel
civilian students. Similarly, the vo-
cational Guidance and Placement
bureau will assist veterans in obtain-
ing part-time work on the same basis
as other students.

A major problem, officials have
pointed out, is the lack of adequate
housing facilities for married veterans
and their wives. An increasing
stream of such veterans is expected
when demobilization is fully under
way.

Veterans here are members of a
Veterans’ organization which is co-
ordinated through Smith’s office.

UC Ninth in Number
Of Ph.D. Awards

The University of Chicago, custom-
arily second in the nation in the total
number of doctorates granted, has
dropped to ninth place in rankings
with other American universities.

The eleventh volume of the series,
“Doctoral Dissertations Accepted by
American Universities” reveals that
the U. of C. accepted 83 dissertations
from 1941 to 1944. Columbia re-
ported the largest number of doctor-
ates, 129, in 27 fields of study. New
York University was second.

Dr. Edward Henry who compiled
the volume has warned that the de-
cline is especially dangerous because
of the large slump in scientific fields
and in applied industrial research.

Hutchins...

(Continued from page one)
Hutchins suggested. “If we must be
constantly prepared for war it is on
labor and industry that the burden
will fall.”

He rapped the May Bill as “the
greatest obstacle to achieving a dur-
able peace,” an anti-democratic pro-
posal that shows that^ve do not trust
democracy.

“Many propose it as patent medi-
cine that will promote health, morals,
and democracy,” he asserted. “But”,
he asked, “are the army and navy the
best agencies to do the job? This is
the first time in history the barracks
room has the reputation for being
a health resort or the proper place
to uplift morals.”

“It teaches men to fight; it teaches
them discipline, but certainly not
democracy. Democracy involves
choice. There is no chiice in the
army.”

He emphasized that “there is no
evidence that conscription protects
places from attack—as witness France
and Poland.” He charged the meas-
ure. as being “proposal to keep the
country on a war basis indefinitely.”

Hutchins urged that the question
be “postponed until after the war.
Steps should be taken only when it
is irresistably clear to a calm and
informed majority that there is no
other way to save our country.”

Kult presented the trade unions ap-
proach to the problem. “A majority
of the soldiers come from labor, so
labor should have something to say
about peacetime labor conscription,”
he declared.

Lying-in-Hospital Observes Its
Semi-Centennial Anniversary

By PAT KINDAHL

In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Lying-in
Hospital and Dispensary, a nation-wide broadcast in tribute to
Dr. Joseph B. DeLee, founder of Lying-in, was presented over
WMAQ last Saturday at 3:00 p.m.

The program, sponsored by the
American Medical Association and
National Broadcasting Association,
was climaxed by a speech on medical
research by President Robert Hut-
chins, and the presentation of certifi-
cates to 55 long-service employees.

The occasion marked the close of
fifty years of service for the Hospital.
During that time, nearly 135,000 ba-
bies have been bom in the hospital
or under the care of its home serv-
ice. In the single year ending June,
1944, Lying-in took care of 4,911
bed patients, and delivered 3,581 ba-
bies.

Valuable research and teaching
have been carried on at Lying-in.
Ergonovine, used to prevent hemor-
rhage after childbirth, is one of the
Hospital’s discoveries. Refinements
have been made at Lying-in in the
techniques of the Caesarian opera-
tion, permitting its wider and safer
use. Thousands of medical students
have learned the method and stand-
ards. More than 750 residents and in-
terns have been given advanced in-
struction in obstetrics and gynecolo-
gy, and some 5,500 nurses have re-
ceived training in obstetrical care.

Today, the hospital maintains a
general clinic, with greatly reduced
fees, for those with limited funds,
and a private clinic for those who
can afford to pay the regular profes-
sional fees. Admission to the general
clinic is on an income basis.

No woman who needs help is turned
away from Lying-in for lack of mo-
ney. During the year ending June,
1944, 11.4% of the patients cared
for paid the full cost of the services
they received. 83.8% paid part of
the cost, and 4.8% paid nothing at all.

The Chicago Lying-in Hospital and
Dispensary was merged with the
University Clinics in 1938. At present
its staff consists of four doctors,
headed by Chief of Staff, Dr. William
J. Dieckmann, who is assisted by
10 residents and 10 interns.

Scientist to Chicago

Political Science at the Ecole Libre

ing at 4:30 p.m.

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Editorial

Welcome Home, Mr. President

Chicago newspapers refer to Robert Hutchins as “Young Mr. Socrates.” And after his
whirlwind speaking tour of the past two weeks, far be it from anyone to challenge or belittle
that appellation. *

The president’s verbalisms and piercing satire have darted through a vast and fascinating
array of subjects which have ranged from lashing postwar conscription and appealing for last-
ing world peace to discussing in a most matter-of-fact fashion the trials and tribulations of Uni-
versity dormitory residents and the observance of the 50th anniversary of Lying-in Maternity
Hospital. His has been truly a “maternity to eternity” campaign.

There are many campus wiseacres who are probing for an ulterior motive behind his

recent speech-making tour, but we doubt that the president has
sleeves. Rather are we inclined to believe that Mr. Hutchins,
the students, now has a genuine desire to become more closely
body and to understand more fully its beliefs and its aspirations.

As the official University spokesman, his comments are always weighted with signifi-
cance. As a brilliant speaker and satirist, his barbs and truisims are of never ending appeal.

Mr. Hutchins will be a welcome guest at any gathering.

La Critique

It is a sad but true commentary that one
journalistic corpse after another now litters the
campus. In recent years many a happily launched
venture has collapsed after its first few appear-
ances.

The arrival on campus, however, of The Critic
is a bright milestone in the campaign to enun-
ciate student opinion on campus, for it fills a
long-standing void. Meanwhile, blueprints for
the future call for a new literary quarterly, a
revamped Handbook, and the revival of Cap and
Gown, the University pictorial annual.

While the infant edition of The Critic is not
a finished product, it represents what we believe
to be a step in the right direction. Too many
literary pieces, worthy of publication, are pro-
duced in classrooms and in spare moments only
to be later discarded for lack of a proper pub-
।
lication medium.

The only danger latent in such a publication
and in all new journals is that they will tend to
be dominated too largely by one special interest
group or clique. A “pervading philosophy” may
be essential; narrow factionalism is intolerable.

Therefore definite measures should be taken
by all publications, assuring all interested writ-
ers an opportunity to serve and to display their
works.

Such a policy, based on realistic liberal jour-

Robeson was invited to speak by
students of the University at a bond
rally, but administration authorities
wanted to know whether he would
“sing, or talk too.” When informed
that he might talk, the students were
told no hall was available.

Later a hall was tentatively ob-
tained, but . again it was thumbs
down from N. U. brasshats, this
time on the grounds that there was
no one available to clean it up after-
wards. When 25 students offered to
show up to do the clean-up job, they
were told that “the right balance
of activities seems to be lacking at
Northwestern.”

The Daily Northwestern, student
newspaper, had no comment.

• The April edition of the Woman’s
Home Companion which charges that
fraternities and sororities are “Cam-
pus Heartaches” has stirred a mild
rumpus at a number of Universites.
The article, written by Mrs. Glenn
Frank, wife of the late president of
Wisconsin U., charged that the frater-

any shockers tucked in his
after his long sojourn from
associated with his student

nalism, is the only method for attaining the ends
to which all University publications are unalter-
ably committed: Service to the student body
and to the institution.

Cleaning House

The remodeling of their long antiquated in-
ter-fraternity constitution comes as the most
progressive step taken by fraternities on this
campus in recent months.

Especially enheartening to campus liberals is
the possibility that Negro groups may now af-
filiate with the I-F. The article requiring main-
tenance of houses on campus as a stipulation for
I-F membership was directed from its inception
at colored organizations, according to fraternity
spokesmen, and its withdrawal comes as a long
overdue measure.

While streamlining of their own procedure
is of unquestioned value, fraternities have yet
to come to grips with the major objection still
confronting them. Fraternities here and else-
where have been too willing in the past to sub-
ordinate the general welfare of the University
to their own petty group interests and prosper-
ity. Only through recognition of a greater good
and purpose can fraternities attain the position
which might be theirs.

Such a status can never be written into any
constitution. Its enactment will come only
through the direct and spontaneous action of
each individual fraternity member himself.

Letters to Editor

Hutchins9 V-E Day Message
Lambasted By Irate Critics

America's educational stormy petrel, President Robert Hutchins, has
stirred the coals again—but this time in international affairs.

Hutchins' V-E day address, at Rockefeller Chapel, yesterday rated lb
inches of type, his picture, and a cartoon by Don Fitzpatrick of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, in Time Magazine. Said a Time pundit in the “Opinion”
department of the “U. S. at War:"

“What President Robert Maynard Hutchins, one time boy wonder of
U.S. education said . . . was provocative: he asked for mercy for the Ger-
mans. It was the first round in an argument of which the world would hear
more.”

Added Time: “Chicago’s Hutchins thus revived the theory held before
1939 that a harsh peace breeds another war. .If he thought no men were
beasts there were plenty of others who thought otherwise.”

Willard Shelton of The Chicago Sun also used the speech as a spring-
board for 15 inches of column material. Charged Shelton: “He is an intel-
lec aristocrat . . . speech suggested doubt, timidity, and lack of faith . . .
devastating pessimism . . . aloof impassion.”

Of nearly a dozen letters to the editor received by THE MAROON on
the speech here are three:

To the Editor,

President Hutchins, speaking about the future world organ-
ization, recently said, “If the organization is likely to promote
war, he (an educated person) will rightly decide that it is worth-
less, and that he will stay out of it if he can”. However, I think
educated people must assume a much more positive role. After
all, an effective world organization is our only chance of peace.
Are we, as educated people, merely to cling to this organization
while the sailing is smooth? At a crisis are we to scurry away
like rats from a sinking ship? No, this sort of policy would never
stop World War HI. Our part can’t be a negative one; educated
people are best equipped to lead in the establishment of a free
and peaceful world.

A strong and just world organization is vital for an enduring peace. And
to be strong and just, it must be backed by the people through thick and
thin. The League of Nations wasn’t supported; it was weak, and it failed.
A sailor wouldn’t desert his ship if it were blown off its course. Instead he
would work to sail it back on the right course. Can educated people then
arbitrarily abandon the world organization when the going gets tough? Or
should they redouble their efforts to make the organization fulfill its purpose
in spite of any crisis ? Either they will passively consent to World War HI,
or they will work and fight to prevent this disaster with the only possible
means. For a world organization is the only conceivable hope for permanent
peace and freedom. Accordingly, educated people must be the last to dis-
card it, particularly as its success is their one chance.

\	—Margaret Cooper.

This Game Didn’t End With Handshake

To the Editor:

It was with surprise, disappointment, and more than a little resentment
that I read President Hutchins* V-E day address. Perhaps to some his
sweetness and light view of defeated Germany passes for great and enlight-
ened humanitarianism. To many others it is a sign of confusion and a kind
of naivete that was never more dangerous than today when it expresses
itself in the desire to avoid one extreme by seeking the other, to avoid
brutality by foolish magnanimity.

Here’s Story of World’s Biggest University Phone System

Handle 20,000 Calls Per
Day On U.C. Switchboard

By ROSE ENCHER

One of the little known but much used—and abused—services
on campus is the University’s unique telephone system.

Probably the largest university tel-
ephone system in existence, its free
telephone hookup covers the entire
campus, the downtown University
College, and Billings and Chicago Ly-
ing-In Hospitals. All can be reached
by calling Midway 0800. Burton-Jud-
son answers to Midway 6000 and In-
ternational House to Fairfax 8200.

Twenty-four hours a day, an aver-
age of 20,000 calls are put through a
central switchboard, located in the
Press Building, to outside lines, to
1,335 campus telephones and to 17
small switchboards.

A serious shortage of operators at
the central switchboard is a current
wartime problem. The eight operators
now on duty do the work of twelve
and are busier than operators at the
Bell Telephone Co.

Mrs. Marie McGee, supervisor, said

A movie filmed during the pres-
entation of ODP’s “The Inspector
General** last January will be pre-
sented here this evening at 8:30 by
the Documentary Film group in the
Ida Noyes theatre.

These preserved highlights of the
back stage preparations and actual

are the fruits of the group’s first
venture into the realms of produuc-
tion. Starred in the ODP play are:
Robert Voas, Arthur Cohen, May-
nard Wishner, John Tarburten, Ro-
berta Unger, and George Sorter.

Jean Gabin’s noted “Daybreak” will
be featured along with “The Inspec-
tor General”.

Responsible for this first celluloid-
ing of campus life are: Jim Bush,
Mort Heilig, Lee Herndon, Russ Mor-

Sidelights on Footlights

We are perched, just now, on a high tower, looking with
hungry eyes at U.C.L.A. and their properly enviable dramatic

set-up.

U.C.L.A.’s theatre activities, which
include a dance workshop, a drama
workshop, and a technical staff, were
consolidated in 1940. The new theatre
program now takes directing, set dec-
orating, costume, and writing un-
der its wing and puts them all toge-
ther to turn out fourteen plays a
year. The only requirement for mem-
bership in the organization is partic-
ipation. U.C.L.A.*s head dirertor,
Ralph Freud, graduate of the Univer-
sity of Michigan, has had experience
with the Bonstelle Stock company,
where he appeared with such now
well known theatre people as Kathe-
rine Cornell and Frank Morgan. At
the Pasadena Playhouse he played
for ten years, then became the direc-
tor of the Federal Theatre in San
Francisco, went to U.C.L.A. in 1939.

Maxwell Anderson’s “Night Over
Taos** was recently performed and
was directed by a student. In addi-
tion to lunching with the author,
the cast got special help from the
lead in the Broadway production,
Burgess Meredith.

in an interview that students can do
much to relieve the situation until
such time as peacetime expansion can
be put into effect.

Elimination of unnecessary calls,
and making necessary calls brief, are
especially appreciated by the opera-
tors during peak hours which are be-
tween 9:30-11:45 and 2:30-4:00 Mon-
day through Friday. A typical peak
hour brings in about 2500 calls.

Rainy days bring in calls far above
the average 20,000 per day. Big
events such as V-E day, President
Roosevelt’s death, etc. bring in so
many calls that no record can be kept.

Other ways in which students can
help keep the telephone system effi-
cient in war time are to speak up as
soon as the operator answers and to
call by extension number.

If you can’t find the number you
want in the faculty or student direc-
tory, it is suggested that you call Mr.
H. Hoeppner at the Information Of-
fice, Ext. 373. Hoeppner maintains an
up-to-date record of student and fac-
ulty names and telephone exchanges.

The University of Chicago has a
large detailed listing of local tele-
phones in the Chicago Telephone Di-
rectory and a detailed listing of de-
partments in the hospitals in the Red
Book.

Fortunately there is no shortage at
the present time of operators in the
telepage system at Billings Hospital.
The telepage system acts as interme-
diary between the central switch-
board and the personnel of the hospi-
tals when the operators at the cen-
tral switchboard cannot locate the
doctors at their clinics or offices. Doc-
tors sign in and out with telepage op-
erators so that their whereabouts are
known at all times.

The telepage is a major improve-
ment over the code and light signal-
ling system used in many hospitals
and still in use at Chicago Lying-In
Hospital. An operator at one of two
dual control boards of the telepage

Now let’s turn our eyes back to
the Middle West—not to weep, but
to wonder. Will there be changes
in our suffering O.D.P. next year?
Or are we writing in the clouds when
we say that a consolidation of our
remarkably talented dance classes
and the Office of Dramatic Produc-
tions would not only be possible but
mutually advantageous? What about
closer relations with the University
Orchestra ? Where are the budding
writers, and wouldn’t they like to see
their plays on a stage? There would
be tremendous opportunities for
dramatic programs were the cam-
pus radio to be established—will
they be developed?

Right now O.D.P. is running on
the peaceful banks of high school
theatre. If it wants to shift to better
things, it will need reorganization,
and not only more direction but more
experienced direction.

There’s a bright future around the
corner, but O.D.P. has to turn the
corner first.

Music Has Two
Functions—

Prescott

By SAMUEL GOLDEN

In previous issues Messrs. Schwab
and Olson have given their approach-
es to the problem of what it is in
music that pleases, and thus on
what basis a piece of music can be
declared good or bad. For the views
of a psychologist, I interviewed Dan-
iel A. Prescott, Professor of Educa-
tion, of the Department of Educa-
tion. Mr. Prescott is an enthusiastic
music lover and an amateur pianist
of note.

As Mr. Prescott sees it, “there
are two prominent functions music
plays in our lives.
One—the	control

Third In	of mood, relief

A Series	from tension; two

—‘the crystalliza-
tion of attitudes*.” Mr. Prescott ex-
plained his meaning of this last
phrase, “A person may feel uncertain
or unsure of something and turn to
music as the expression of the ex-
periences of others. As he lends him-
self to the moods of the music, he
finds his own moods clarified and
ordered.”

Music has both an intellectual and
emotional basis, but if good, that will
be due to the emotional part. The
emotion in music is fundamentally
the expression of the composer’s ex-
periences, and in particular the in-
fluences upon him of his particular
culture group. In fact music may be
seen, according to Prescott, to be the
permanent expression of attitude and
feelings of the period of its composi-
tion. Viewed in this light, music be-
comes what Prescott calls “an ad-
junct to the Social Sciences”; for it
is able to show feelings and attitudes,
where the social sciences can only
describe events. Thus modem music,
with its dissonances, irregular tem-
pos and rhythms is the outgrowth
of the uncertainties and frustrations
which characterize modern life. Even
the conventional music forms of a

Unique Twist
In War Yarn

The Prisoner by Earnest Lothar
is a dramatic, suspenseful book with
a new twist.

The story concerns a young Ger-
man boy in a prisoner of war camp
in Colorado and tells in flash-back
his experiences in Germany as a Na-
zi. A Hitler Youth, fanatically de-
voted to the Fuehrer and to Nazi-
ism, he comes to realize the instabili-
ty and irresponsibility of his govern-
ment when he tries to appeal the
verdict rendered against him in a
false accusation of theft.

He is captured on a Normandy
beach on D-Day, but finds a prison
camp no protection from the Gestapo.

A very exciting book, and one we
found hard to lay down until it was
finished. The writing is a little awk-
ward in spots, but that may have oc-
curred in the translation.

Dr. Lothar is himself a refugee
from the Nazis, having fled to this
country in 1938 when Austria fell to
the Germans. Previous to that time
he had been a prominent writer in
Vienna and was recognized as a foe
of Nazism.

Hutchins, Dept, of

From time to time anecdotes of the president come to our attention.
The latest emanates from a meeting at Burton-Judson where the president
was giving and taking it in a hot discussion of anything and everything on
campus. As there was a lull in the conversation, someone piped up, “And
what do you think of student government, Mr. Hutchins?”. The president
flashed back, “I don’t know—you see, I haven’t read THE MAROON for a
year!” We are not sure whether he was prevaricating or just being non-
committal, for his office subscribes for no less than five copies of THE
MAROON.

Date Life

Beecherites are all a-twitter over a letter they received this week from
one Howard. It began: “HEY YOU COEDS! Are all your dates a flop?”
and went on to say that the writer personifies the ideal date—handsome,
intelligent, good dancer, good conversationalist, and The Kiss You’ll Never
Forget. All you have to do to have a date with this wonderful man is to
call HAYmarket 5951 to set the time, call for him (he will meet you down-
town if necessary), and pay all the expenses for the evening. He tells us
that his only purpose is “to meet lots of people.” More vital statistics—he’s
21, weighs 170, and is five foot ten. If the line is busy, call again.

Around the Campus

An eagle-eyed contributor notes that for the last few days two ducks
have been residing in one of the many ponds on the Midway. Perhaps they’re
setting up residence requirements or else President Hutchins is taking the
precepts of liberal education very seriously. The local ASTP’s have been
sporting fishtails on their shoulder lately—it seems some sportive compara-
tive anatomy students tossed said tails out the window and hit the men
squarely. We discovered that one of the Commons employees has a sense
of humor; the other night some of our friends were changing the specials
sign—as the employee approached, they tried not to look guilty and were
most pleasantly surprised when said employee completed a bon mot.

entered the Whirled War, we must
refer you to a Democratic historian.
No Republican has ever figured it
out. Our closest approximation is
that the war was caused and waged
by two eminent Democrats, Pres-
dent Wilson and his confidential ad-
visor, Colonel E. M. House. The
student should realize that there is
no connection between Col. House and
the occasional counselors of earlier
presidents, Upper House and Lower
House, and that he was entirely un-
related to the constant companion of
President Harding, Full House. Upon
Wilson’s leaving the White House,
the colonel was deposed, and there-
after known as Out House.

The fighting of the war was made
extremely difficult by the stiff re-
sistance put up by the enemy, com-
manded by the famous German gener-
al, Achmein Himmel. The Whirled

War was eventually won by some-
one, just by whom seems to be some-
what in doubt. The peace treaty was
formulated by the Belgians, who
maintained that they had been the
victims of several atrocities during
the war. To reciprocate they inflicted
the Treaty of Versailles, generally
considered the greatest atrocity of
all time.

This treaty refused to lie down and
be repulsive in the pages of Demo-
cratic histories, but lived on, faintly
like Dracula, in the form of the
League of Nations. The United States
was saved from the catastrophe of
joining the League only by the inter-
vention of a powerful secret organiza-
tion of Republicans known as the
Henry Cabot Lodge.

pages the doctors vocally through mi-
crophones that extend throughout all
parts of Billings.

The experienced and highly respon-
sible telepage operators locate doc-
tors in less than a minute even
though the contact involves paging in
three or four departments. Emergen-
cy calls are distinguished from urgent
calls by calling the doctor’s name four
times in rapid succession. No other
paging is done until the emergency
call is answered by the doctor from
any one of the extensive telepage
phones throughout the hospital.

Telepage operators are surrounded
with schedules of the doctors’ pro-
grams but take such an interest in
their work that they have almost all
of them memorized. They handle
from 600 to 700 telepage contacts a
day and also transmit 100 to 200 calls
to and from patients. The operators
keep records as to which patients are
allowed to make and receive calls and
which ones are too ill for calls.

It is their responsibility, also, to
locate the person in charge of the oxy-
gen tanks at a moment’s notice. Stu-
dent Health night time calls are also
transmitted through telepage. The
operators are Peggy Ward, supervis-
or, Dorothy Moynihan, Kay Cleary,
Ann Calahan, Elaine Posner (College-
4), and Isabelle Southward, night op-
erator.

The extensive telephone system as
it is today grew from humble begin-
nings in Cobb Hall in 1902, moved to
the Press Building in 1907, and ap-
proximated the large size it is today
in 1919 when the University tripled
in cubage. The extension of the cen-
tral system to include the hospitals
took place in 1935.

The system is constantly kept in
repair with several service men on
hand every day.

Midway 0800 will rarely respond
with a busy signal. Sixty-four trunk
lines are part of the system.

period are heavily influenced by pre-
vailing ideas and other culture con*
tent, e.g. the overpowering influence
of the Church can be held accountable
for the prevalence of such forms as
the mass and cantata.

This, of course does not deny
that a composer can write in a style
different from that prevalent in his
period. But “I regard it of the high-
est significance that Szostakovitch
and Stravinsky weren’t contem-
poraries (in their music style) with
Mozart. And in like manner, we can
be quite sure that if Mozart were
alive today, he would not write the
same music he did.”

Consistent with his general posi-
tion, he regards the best composers
as those who incorporate “their to-
tal life experience in their music,
while giving a feeling of the times.”

Why people are affected differently
by music is a question which Mr.
Prescott is very interested in. In
the course of his classes on “Emo-
tion and the Educative Process”, he
has been accustomed to play music
to his students, and over several
years he has been able to make some
generalization. “I have observed that,
for example, three to four times
as many persons between the ages
of 18 to 30 react favorably to mo-
dem music than do those over 40. I
think one primary explanation is
to be found in the different cultural
background the two groups were

howls of the blood thirsty mob. We are to see that Germany is taken back
into the family of nations and re-educated. We are to remember the dis-
tinction between humanity and bmte. But Mr. Hutchins as an educator is
over-estimating the efficiency of his profession and is assuming that Ger-
many in its present state of humanity bears any relationship to humanity.

Germany has produced some of the world’s greatest scholars. Germany
still has great scientists. Yet Germany as one of the world’s intellectual
leaders removed itself from the realms of human law. (The Germans ob-
viously consider themselves a different species from the Poles, French, Bel-
gians, Czechs, Russians, Dutch, Norweigans, English—and Americans whom
they tortured, starved, and murdered. Anyone who assumes that because
a creature can speak, read, and write he is capable of being guided by
reasoning, is ignoring the moral depths to which the Germans have sunk
and is ivory-towering it with a vengeance.

Mr. Hutchins says that illegal action cannot be punished illegally. Since
when is the punishment of a crime illegal?

Mr. Hutchins deplores putting the Germans on a dole amounting to a
third of American army rations. I ask him to remember that Europe’s
peasants have for centuries lived on much less.

Mr. Hutchins is sure that in a few years the excitement over war
criminals will seem “rediculous.” I am sure it will not. Those of us whose
friends and relatives have come out of German prison camps walking skeletons
will not thing it rediculous. Those who saw Buchenwald and Dachau will
not think them rediculous. Neither will the slave laborers, the inhabitants
of gutted cities, the victims of the world’s greatest crime orgies think them
rediculous.

Yes, Mr. Hutchins, we must remember the responsibility falling to us
as educated people. As such we demand the kind of justice we have been
taught to believe in—the justice that lets the innocent go free but lays a
heavy hand on the guilty.

Brutal revenge is inconsistant with an intelligent peace; but so it
jeopardizing our future by misguided generosity. American sportsmanship
is fine—in its place; but def erance to a treacherous enemy is not sportsman
ship but assininity.

In the words of General Eisenhower, “This has not been a game that
ends with a handshake.”

‘Human Decency Demands Justice’

To the Editor:

President Hutchins in his speech at the campus V-E day ceremonies
made some startling observations which are open to question.

1.	He implies that the reports of Nazi crimes are “propaganda.” He
compares the sober concern of the American people in Nazi mass homicide
with 1918 hysteria and describes this concern in effect as “ridiculous.” The
evidence and testimony of our congressmen, editors, and generals indicates
that any atrocity stories we are receiving are underwritten and not exag-
gerated. Moreover the testimony does not begin with the war in 1939 but
the “peace” in 1933. Surely Mr. Hutchins has availed himself of the personal
information he can get on horror camps from members of his own faculty.
We agree with him that vengeance is for the Lord, but human decency and
the debt to the millions slain demand justice.

2.	Mr. Hutchins does not believe a whole nation can be indicted. But
shall we let the guilty go free? Can we say that war is a brutalizing ex-
perience and that therefore the Fascists are not personally guilty? Our
answer is that a personal choice is involved in every crime committed,
whether by an American or German. We too are fighting, but we have not
seen fit to enslave people, to torture prisoners, or to kill for pleasure. These
deeds are still crimes for our American soldiers.

3.	By implication Mr. Hutchins attacks the San Francisco Conference
and the Yalta agreements. Peace can only be assured by democratic nations
that are prepared to work harmoniously to to recognize and stop aggression.
Unless the four great nations, America, Great Britain, Russia, and China
have unity with respect to world problems there can be no peace. This is
the realistic approach that President Roosevelt established at Yalta and
Dumbarton Oaks, and which the people of the world support. Any other
approach is a snare and delusion.

4.	The precondition of future progress is the destruction of Fascism.
Not one word of this was in President Hutchins’ address. By destroying
Fascism we reestablish the dignity of man; by destroying Fascism we have
taken the first step on the road to lasting peace. This is the significance of
V-E day.

Maroon Ball Season Nears Climax

Net Team Rolls
On Undefeated
Cuff Iowa State Crew, 4-2;
Will Close Slate at Purdue

By BOB RUDOLPH

The University tennis team
led by Phil Glotzer and Harry
Tully downed the Iowa State
netters 4-2 in a dual meet on the
Midway course last Saturday.
The victory was the squad’s sev-
enth in an undefeated season
and tagged them as a team to
watch in the forthcoming West-
ern Conference title meet sched-
uled at Evanston May 26.

Glotzer, playing number one sin-
gles disposed of Dick Lord in a close
match, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. Tully, playing
number two defeated Gene Wishnuff
6-2, 6-4, despite a twisted ankle, to
remain unbeaten in singles compe-
tition. Iowa State scored its first
point when its number three man,
Martin Jaffe, disposed of Dick Sha-
piro 6-0, 6-0. Apparently “bespec-
tacled” Dick had an off-day. Playing
in the number four slot for Chicago,
Norm Greenberg gave the Maroons a
3-1 edge in the match by defeating
Tom Stout 6-1, 6-1.

The two doubles matches were
split, Chicago winning the number
one play and Iowa State copping the
number two contest.

This Saturday, the team travels to
Lafayette, Indiana, to meet Purdue in
their final dual match before the Big
Ten title meet. Should the Maroons
defeat the Purdue squad by a decisive
margin, they would rate over Minne-
sota who bowed to the Boilermaker
team last week 8-1, and Northwestern
who have dropped two decisions to
the Maroon netmen and who lost to
Purdue last week, 7-2.

Norgren’s men rate a close second
along with Ohio State as the chief
competition for the title holding Wol-
verines who look like they may re-
peat last year’s feat again and come
out of the meet at Evanston with an-
other tennis title.

The statement adopted by the
meeting, and signed by prominent
faculty and student leaders, support-

Dumbarton Oaks and Yalta, and set
forth the bases for a world security
organization as including the self de-

and veterans’ point of view about the
Conference; and Dr. T. Walter John-

Play Wheaton Here Saturday;
Purdue Joust Caps Campaign

By MARSHAL LOWENSTEIN

After playing host to Wheaton College Saturday afternoon
at 2:30 at Greenwood Field, the Maroons will journey to Purdue
Tuesday to close their 1945 season.

Kurt Smith will probably hurl both
games for the Maroons. Smith, a
slim right hander, permitted Western
Michigan only 4 singles last week, but
the Maroons were shaded, 2-0.

Tomorrow’s game against Wheaton
will be the home finale. Wheaton
previously defeated Chicago.

In tightening up the strings to the
infield, one of the weakest spots in
the club, Chicago played its best
game of the season here against
Western Michigan. Coach J. Kyle
Anderson called it the best Chicago
baseball performance in “three sea-
sons.” At Kalamazoo, the Maroons
had been trounced, 18-3.

Smith pitched beautiful ball to his
battery mate, Jim Vaughan, through-
out the game, throwing 65 strikes in
100 pitched balls. Well placed hitting,
although not as numerous as that of
the Maroons, and spectacular fielding
in both sections of the field by Kala-
mazoo were the factors which deter-
mined the outcome.

Twice Michigan pushed across one
run; twice Chicago placed two men on
base with only one away, only to

College Spikesters Cop Seventh
Straight Private School Bauble

By DAVE BRODER

Paced by two double-winners, the College track team placed
in every event except one to take their seventh straight win in
the Private School League meet. The Senior tracksters rolled
up 66 points, 18 more Than their closest competitor, North Park
Academy.

Running on a rain-swept, soggy
track, on Wednesday afternoon, Coach
Paul Derr’s men took 8 first places,
3 seconds, 4 thirds, 1 fourth, and 2
fifths. Captain Bob Collins and Dave
Hall led the team, the former winning
both the high and low hurdles and
the latter copping wins in the 440
and the broad jump. Other winning
performances were turned in by
“Skinny” Hanson in the mile, Dave
Weaver in the high jump, Chuck Fer-
ris in the pole vault, and the relay
team composed of Collins, Johnson,
Petty, and Hall.

Second place winners included Bob
Petty in the 220, Jim Blaut in the
half mile and Bob Smith in the low
hurdles. Don Johnson got a third
in the 100, Nick Sousoures took third
in the discus, Don Bushnell tied for
third in the high jump, and Hanson
came -:ack from the mile to tie for
third in the pole vault. Frank Man-
gin took fourth in the mile, Johnson
took fifth in the 220, and Lionel Eu-
banks got fifth in the discus.

At the District meet last Friday,
the College took fourth place out of
15 competing schools, and qualified
four men for the State meet today
and tomorrow. Those men are Dave
Hall in the 440, Bob Collins in the
low hurdles, Chuck Ferris in the pole
vault, and Dave Weaver in the high
jump.

Both games will be played on the

Three intramural softball leagues
will begin action as soon as the
weather permits, according to Coach

pected to open Monday.

Government...

in an editorial campaign of THE
CHICAGO MAROON. In January,
members of the women’s residence
halls met to discuss the scope of such
an organization. At an assembly spon-
sored by THE MAROON on Janu-
ary 24 dormitory representatives took
the first positive step toward a stu-
dent government.

Commuters held a mass meeting at
Oriental Institute on February 16
and elected a committee of 15 to rep-
resent them in setting up the organ-
ization.

Leaders in the movement have em-
phasized that an effective student or-
ganization can not be built overnight.
Though the progress has been slow
they expect to develop a useful or-
ganization that will contribute to the
establishment of a “community of
scholars.”
