The Hutchins

I Know ...'

When Mr. Hutchins first invaded the Midway he was
labeled a “boy wonder.” Now, sixteen years later, it would be
an overstatement to call him a boy. But he is still a wonder.

He has earned the position of Public Enemy Number One
of the status quo in the higher learning. He is guilty of an
interest in morals, in the intellect—even in education. Worse
still, he is guilty of trying to do something about them.

Mr. Hutchins has challenged the accepted, time-honored tradi-
tions of what an education and a university should be. He is the
first man in many years to stimulate people to appraise and re-
examine their own ideas about education. He has almost made the
discussion of ideas a respectable occupation.

This Clark Gable of the higher learning has turned the University
of Chicago upside down. In fact, he has—to some extent—remade
it in his own image. What are the features of this image?

Hutchins' Courage

The first feature is courage. Soon after he came to Chicago he
put on the gloves and started swinging. He swung left and right at
all the sacred cows in the academic stable.

Enraged by his challenge to
their pet ideas, by his threat to
the pleasant, comfortable way
they had of doing things, the
academicians swung back — and
plenty hard. A few times they
nearly had the champ swinging
on the ropes, but they couldn’t
knock him out. Now, all but a
few die-hards finally concede he
is the winner.

He has also swung hard at ene-
mies of academic freedom. Ten
years ago, a local magnate and the
yellow press charged that the Uni-
versity was a communist institu-
tion. They demanded the dismis-
sal of certain professors, whose
opinions and extra - curricular
activities they disapproved.

The upshot was an official in-
vestigation of the University by
the Illinois Senate. Hutchins went
into the ring and fought a tough
battle for academic freedom. His
knock-out blows hurled the yel-
low press into retreat, its tail be-
tween its legs.

But Hutchins* greatest triumph was a public apology from the mag-
nate. This apology consisted of a $500,000 gift to the University—to
endow a foundation for the study of American institutions.

Hutchins' Humility

Another feature of the image is humility. Men of less spiritual
stature would have been spoiled by so many conspicious successes.
Yet this man of Olympian bearing has not let years of being in the
public eye turn his head. He is never satisfied, never complacent.

One day a friend was talking to him about some of the progress in
education since Hutchins had started his wholesale smashing of antique
academic idols. “When I look back ten years,” the Chancellor said,
“I can see there has been some progress. But when I look around and
see how much there is still left to do, I sometimes get so discouraged
I feel like jumping in the lake.”

At another time he confided, “Depression is the natural state of
mind for a University president. It’s like we used to say in the army,
‘When you’re sleeping on the floor, you can’t fall out of bed.’ ”

Hutchins' Wit

Still another feature of the image is wit. A college student once
said of him, “Hutchins is as witty as Bob Hope—and he’s got a much
better looking pan.”

He is a master of quick come-backs. He often displayed this skill
at annual dinners given by the MAROON. After eating the somewhat
less than Lucullan feast served by the Commons, he answered any
questions asked by the students.

At one of these dinners, an earnest undergraduate asked, “Mr.
Hutchins, why doesn’t the University give courses in sex hygiene and
marriage technique?”

Hutchins replied, “Sex hygiene and marriage technique are good
things. I am in favor of them. I think everyone should know as much
about them as possible. I do not believe, however, that the University
of Chicago should offer courses in them toward the bachelor’s degree.”

Hutchins' Drive

An essential part of the image is drive. “Singleness of purpose,”
he once remarked, “that’s the only way to achieve results.”

His single purpose is to reform education and improve the Univer-
sity. He devotes himself to this task with the zeal of a missionary
or a prophet.

He passes up chances of making easy money for himself. He turns
a deaf ear to many invitations to speak or write—in spite of the big
fees.

He turns thumbs down on offers of public office or private business
which would dazzle and seduce less single-minded men. These activi-
ties would deflect him from his purpose.

He engages in constant intellectual activity. To him, the great
books are not merely subjects for educational controversy. They are
his daily companions.

In addition to beating a tom-tom for the higher learning, he also
shakes a tambourine for the University. In fact, he is the champion
tambourine shaker in the academic world today.

A realist, as well as a prophet, he accepts the never-ending re-
sponsibility—though not too happily—of raising the funds needed to
achieve his purpose of improving the University.

He was once accused of accepting “dirty money” for the institution.
He replied, “I’ll tell you what we do with dirty money. We take it,
wash it and then use it.”

Courage, humility, wit and drive—these, then, are features of the
image in which the University is being remade. They help explain
why, by any definition, Mr. Hutchins is a great man.

End of an era: II

By ABE KRASH

• (Editor-in-Chief)

The University’s decision to abolish fraternities in The
College is as momentous as it is inevitable. That it is of striking
significance in the saga of American education cannot be doubt-
ed for it marks the end of a chapter, the era of the “roaring
’20’s” in higher learning. The two great symbols of triviality
in American education—football and the fraternities—have
joined each other in the academic graveyard at Chicago.

That it is a fundamentally wise and just decision, I believe cannot
be doubted. The sharp, incisive logic of The Board of Trustees is in-
controvertible. Conventional education is dead at Chicago; conven-
tional fraternities must also perish. In their day fraternities fulfilled
a certain need. With the inaugural of the college program and its
resident plan that need has disappeared. Therefore the fraternities
are no longer necessary. And since they are not only superfluous but
actually menace the success of the program they must be eliminated.
It may very well be asked if the same logic does not apply equally
well to the women’s clubs?

To education as a whole, however, the pronouncement of the board
ignores a vital section of the issue. Its statement is singular in what
it omits as well as in what it says. It catalogs, quite justly, the note-
worthy contributions which fraternities have made to this University.
But it omits those salient points which constituted such a crushing
indictment against the entire fraternity system everywhere—the
social schisms which it has generated, the bigotry and prejudice which
it has condoned, the appalling misemphasis which it has represented.
It is true that in omitting such salient facts the board has spared
itself the painful necessity of weighing the advantages and disadvan-
tages of the system against each other in order to attain a verdict.
By their absence, however, the case history is notably incomplete
and distorted; all the facts should have been presented.

Board Action Was Indecisive

By its refusal to entertain these considerations, The Board
was enabled, with a clear conscience, to countenance, the sur-
vival of fraternities at the divisional level; for it is true that the
University is not prepared to provide extra-curricular oppor-
tunities in the graduate schools analogous to those it offers
in The College. Student-initiated social organizations are thus
afforded the continued opportunity to make a vital contribution
to the life of divisional students. But such groups can advance
their benefits far more readily if they are freed from the shackles
of anti-intellectualism, discrimination, and snobbishness which
they will inherit as the lineal descendants of the? fraternity
system. It would have been far wiser for the Board, once and
for all, to have eradicated all fraternities from the entire Uni-
versity.

In any event, any discussion of the continuance of conventional
fraternities on a divisional level in practice must be purely academic.
The figures relate the story of .the steady downfall and decline of the
fraternities at the University of Chicago in eloquent fashion: 33
chapters with 751 members in 1928; 15 chapters with 551 members
in 1941. Without the steady influx of conventional freshman and
sophomore students, fraternities must suffocate. It is to be hoped that
the chapters here will prevent the long agony of a lingering death
by liquidating immediately or by taking the prompt measures neces-
sary for the drastic revisions entailed by the Board’s decision.

In permitting fraternities to continue until 1947, The board sacri-
fices principles on the altars of expediency. The administration cites
the need for a “transitional period.” But the transition in 1947 will
be essentially as tortuous then as it is now. If the abolition of frater-
nities in the College is wise and necessary, then the sooner they are
ousted the better. One does not wait for “further developments” in
putting out afire.

The University and Its Responsibilities

With the decision, the University assumes new obligations.
Justice is due the fraternity members as individuals. We are
confident that the University, noted for its integrity, will assist
in every possible manner the dismantling or revision of the
fraternity framework at the minimum expense and inconven-
ience to the individuals and chapters involved.

In addition, the administration must now be prepared to assume
the full responsibility for providing the milieu in which a healthy
extra-curricular house program can be constructed. Such a plan re-
quires a clear definition of the purpose and ends of the house ac-
tivities. It demands a full measure of support in terms of personnel
and finance, for only if the residence program is successful will the
action in barring fraternities be fully justified.

. In this, the atom bomb age, liberal education confronts its greatest
crisis, its most searching challenge. Far more critical problems than
the fraternity issue remain to be solved. The solution to these questions
is incumbent upon unity—a oneness of our intents and cur actions.
As such the abolition of fraternities is a fundamentally wise and
meaningful step forward.

Opens 54th
Year Friday

THE CHICAGO MAROON
launched its fifty-fourth year of
continuous publication today
thoroughly reorganized, and pre-
paring to reconvert to the peace-
time footing it left in 1942.

One of the largest staffs in the
paper’s history, numbering more
than 80 persons who were culled
from nearly 400 applicants, moved
into action this week after a six-
week publication delay, suresult of
a critical manpower shortage in
the printing industry.

In framing the most ambitious
expansion program in nearly half
a century, the paper has moved
to new headquarters, revamped
its staff structure and machinery
of operations, and drafted a new
franchise with administration
authorities.

Semi-Weekly Planned for Spring

Editor-in-Chief Abe Krash, in
outlining operation plans, yester-
day disclosed that the new print-
ing contract provides for an 8-12
page weekly. Expansion to a semi-
weekly is contemplated in the
spring quarter if the printing
crisis has eased and staff reorgan-
ization plans materialize.

The printing shortage, Krash
pointed out. has already placed
severe limitations on a number
of proposals which are being held
in abeyance. Among these he
numbered expanded news, feature,
and sports coverage; an increase
in the amount of space devoted
to photography; a special monthly
literary and music supplement;
and other features.

The editorial policy of the paper,
Krash said, will remain “drasti-
cally independent and decisively
liberal.” Quoting from the paper’s
credo enunciated a year ago, he
said that THE MAROON will re-
main “free from bias and preju-
dices, a member of no party but
sympathetic to all. We shall never
be dominated by any pressure
group or petty clique.”

He added, “THE MAROON will
be a constructive critic in praising
that which we regard as good, de-
nouncing that which we believe
to be unjust or contrary to the
well-being of the University as a
whole.”

The news columns of the paper
will remain completely free and
will be independent of the edi-
torial and opinion columns.

The editorial position of the
paper will be stated in the edi-
torial columns. Opinions of col-
umnists are those of individuals
and not necessarily those of THE
MAROON. On the contrary, many
columnists who have complete
freedom frequently present view-
points which are the direct oppo-
site of those aired as the paper’s
policy.

Reynolds Is Site for Offices

The spacious new suite of offices
is located in the south wing of
The Reynolds Club and is being
completely equipped. Room 201
has been designated as the news
room and will include the offices
of The Managing, News, Feature,
Sports, Rewrite, and Copy Editors.
The Business Manager and Circu-
lation Manager are in Room 202
and all business transactions will
be handled in that department.
Room 203 has been set aside as
the office of the Editor. A dark
room, completely equipped, will
be installed in the third floor of
the clubhouse for all publications.

The paper is planning extensive
public service features. Among
the most prominent will be an
exhaustive weekly calendar of
events which will include an-
nouncements of both academic and
student activities. Organizations
should submit announcements by
calling or writing the calendar
editor by the Tuesday preceding
each week’s publication.

The circulation department of
the paper has contacted 200 uni-
versity newspapers throughout the

Educational and
Otherwise . . .

Education’s manifesto of 1945 is Harvard University’s
GENERAL EDUCATION IN A FREE SOCIETY. It pro-
nounces in 267 pages of carefully selected phrases that the day
of the gentlemen scholar is at an end And that the era of the
educated citizen is at hand.

In many ways this is one of the
most astounding documents yet
produced on educational philoso-
phy. That its influence will be
enormous and far reaching is not
to be questioned. It is nearly a
c-ntury since Charles Dickens
spoke of the “quiet influence” of
Harvard, but the school along The
Charles River still wields a school-
marm’s rod over the thoughts and
actions of most American school-
men.

To numerous educators through-
out the nation, harrassed by the
myriad problems of reconversion
and magnetized by the rising trend
toward liberal education, the Har-
vard manifesto comes as manna
from heaven. The New York Times
summarized their sentiments when
it hazarded the guess that “this
report might be a landmark in
education.”

But liberal educators, who never
wear soft gloves, had harsher
words for Harvard’s expenditure
of $60,000 and two years by 12 of
its most ditinguished professors.
The report is certainly no light-
ning shaft hurled down from
Olympus. It states nothing new,
original. It lacks the zest, the
pioneering spirit so necessary to
any revolutionary doctrine—be it
in education or economics. At best,
it simply restates some of the find-
ings of other Universities which
for a quarter of a century have
pondered the problems of a gen-
eral education. •

Harvard’s diagnosis is the same
as that reached by nearly every
liberal educator. Science and tech-
nology are not enough to make
the whole man. There must be
ideals to guide men in their re-
lations with one another. Demo-
cracy is an unworkable dream if
men lack common traditions and
ideas, common premises and hopes.

The “cultural core” plan, the
emphasis on education for citizen-
ship before education for tech-
nology, the tri-partite division in-
to the humanities, natural sciences,
and the social sciences; the “great
texts” theory, the abolition of bar-
gain-basement elective courses,

the emphasis on reorganization in
the secondary schools — here is
sheer plagiarism from Chicago,
Columbia, St. John’s, Wisconsin.

It has been said that there is
no copyright on ideas. But the is-
sue is not one of passing out due
credit to the liberal educators. It
is a question of properly evalu-
ating the experience, the trials and
errors of liberal education, and of
placing them in their proper con-
text in a true survey of education.
Harvard disclaims at the outset
any originality for its report, but
it cannot disclaim its failure in
not properly examining the plans
which have been advanced by the
progressives. As such, the Har-
vard proposal is tragically inade-
quate.

* • •

Education is at the crossroads.
Throughout the nation there is a
growing concern in Universities
with the problem of enunciating
a common set of traditions and
ideals if democracy is to be made
workable. There is growing con-
cern with the necessity for train-
ing students to think and to eval-
uate. Harvard restates the philoso-
phy which most educators now
accept. But it does not answer
that question that cries for an
answer: How best can liberal ed-
ucation be implemented? How can
specialization be reconciled with
generalization? These are practi-
cal, day-to-day questions. These
are the burning issues. Granted
that we have a proper philosophy,
education then becomes a question
of means, of tactics, of method.

And it is here that Harvard fails,
it is here that the report is in-
complete and imperfect.

In any event liberal education
has unearthed an invaluable bed-
fellow. Where Chicago, Columbia,
and St. John’s have failed, Har-
vard’s great prestige may succeed.
The liberal educators—the black
sheep of the higher learning—
should dust off the welcome mat.
Harvard is the first of the guests.
Many more will arrive on the
scene in the days to come.

Shall We Reveal A-Bomb Secret?

’ Yes!” assert 82%

Judy Downs

Ellen Baum

"No!" answer 12%

By HELEN TARLOW

What do the neighbors of the atom bomb think of it? The
Chicago Maroon poll began this week with the question, “Should
we reveal the atom bomb secret?”

Eighty people were interviewed,
the distribution of college and di-
visional students being equal. Of
these, 82% said “Yes,” 18%, “No.”
Just for the record, there was
one undecided, and although sev-
eral others thought that the ques-
tion merited more attention, they
volunteered definite answers.

22% of the “yesses” answered
that there was no secret any more,
and let it go at that. A few more
thought that, in view of this, a
a magnificent gesture should be
made, the U. S. demonstrating its
>y “giving away”
the secret.

1 7 % more,
mostly divisional
students, said
“only if” there
was an interna-
tional organiza-
tion. Most of
them thought
that the secret
should be r e -
vealed only after
such an organiza-

good intentions

tion exists, while a few thought
that it should be used to force the
organization into existence. Com-
ments from these people reveal
such opinions as, “ . . . only thing
big enough and strong enough to
handle it,” . . . then no one will
have the courage to use it,” “ . . .
force for peace.” A few specified
that the scientists of the world
should retain control.

Withholding the secret now
would, in the- opinion of several
others, be the signal for the be-
ginning of an armaments race on a
large, disastrous
scale. Since the
basis of future
peace must be
“mutual trust”
and “internation-
al cooperation,”
they believe that
the only way to
prevent the re-
currence of
armed camp situ-

ations would be through our will-
ingness to infuse real meaning into
these words.

Strongly against the withhold-
ing of the formula are those who
see in our sole possession of it an
impetus to an ultra-nationalistic
“big stick” policy, whose disastrous
results would far outweigh the
dangers of releasing the secret of
atomic energy to the world. . . .
and there are always the fatalists,
who say ‘yes, we may as well know
who has it, so we’ll know where
to watch for danger.* .

nation and copies of those publi-
cations will be available in The
Reynolds Club in about two
weeks. The file will be maintained
daily.

Although most staff positions
have already been filled, there are
still several vacancies. Any per-
son officially enrolled in the Uni-
versity is eligible for a staff post
and should contact the Assistant-
to-the-Editor.

Editorial Freedom Maintained

The new arrangements negoti-
ated with the University provide
for new facilities, a completely
free editorial policy, and economic
stability. No administration or
faculty editorial supervision of
any kind, except those of the
standards provided by law, will
be exercised. Flection of officers
will be purely a staff affair once
competence of candidates has been
assured.

ism is in a bad way. Most of them
feel that the U. S. is the only na-
tion to be trusted, since it is the
least likely to turn aggressor. They
feel that the rest of the world is too
nationalistic, “ ...
incapable of the
peaceful pursuit
of 1 i f e.” Then
there are the
watchful ones
who feel that
“they’ll get it
themselves by
the time they
want to use it”;
“. . . let them

find out as we did—only be sure
we know when they do”; . . .
“They’ll get it eventually; let’s
forestall their use of it”; . . . “our
only chance to keep ahead in the
armaments race, until we battle
our inevitable enemies.”

Tinkers to
Play for All

During the fall, winter, and fol-
lowing quarters one can expect to
hear much of the Tinkers Guild.
The Guild’s agenda lists more than
a few activities which are materi-
alizing through practice periods
and rehearsals.

Activities are confined, for the
most part, to four phases: dancing,
both modern and social; costume
and stage technique; chorus and
orchestra music and gymnastics.

It is the hope of the Guild mem-
bers that their group will be
known as an entertainment pool.
In part, their goal was achieved
when a request by the Ida Noyes
Council to play at a coke dance
was fulfilled by the Guild orches-
tra. They will also furnish the
music at another coke-dance on
Nov. 23.

The Critics

A pair of Hindemith works, one
old and one new, honoring the
composer’s fiftieth birthday today,
were the core of last week’s Uni-
versity concerts.

The Mandel Hall concert on
Monday, the fifth, saw the first
American presentation of Sonata
for Violin and Piano (1939) in a
neat and smooth reading by Isaac
Stern, violinist, and Alexander Za-
kin, pianist. The work must have
been a disappointment to the boys
who have been looking to Hinde-
mith to lead modern music out of
the wilderness. The fourth sonata
of Hindemith for this combination,
like its predecessor the Sonata No.
3 in E (1935), is given over to tra-
ditionalist procedures and conven-
tional rhythms. Melodic lines were
slight and much time was devoted
to development.

The University College concert,
on Wednesday, the seventh, of-
fered Hindemith’* Quintet for
Wind Instruments, Op. 24, No. 2,
nee Kleine Kammermusik No. 2.
The Chicago Symphony Wind
Quintet (Eck, flute; Mayer, oboe;
Stowell, clarinet; Kotas, horn;
Kessler, bassoon) provided a
straightforward performance of
this lively work. It was preceded
by Beethoven’s Quintet in E Flat,
Op. 16, for piano, oboe, clarinet,
bassoon, and horn, with Perry
O’Neil as pianist. This shamefully
neglected work is richly textured
and magnificently wrought. Sup-
ple combinations provide a crys-
talline structure which never ob-

The Jazz Club of the University
of Chicago swung into the fall
quarter with a flourish and an
increase of forty in membership.

At the meeting of October 25,
newly elected President Owen
Jenkins assumed office, and guest
speaker of the evening Evelyn
Featheringill presented a program
of modern jazz, i.e., Dizzy Gilles-
pie. This program came as a blow
to those who had condemned the
campus jazz club as a clique of
purists and reactionaries. Actu-
ally, the club’s programs are only
a reflection of the tastes of its
members, which in the past veered
towards the New Orleans and
Chicago schools. However, this
does not mean the more recent
styles cannot also be observed and
discussed in deference to new
members whose tastes may lie in
that direction.

George Hoefer, one of Chicago’s
most prominent jazz record col-
lectors, returned as guest at the
last meeting, November 8, to play
and discuss fifteen rare items from
his collection.

Stern Plays Extensive Program

Stern’s program also held Schu-
bert’s Duo in A, Op. 162; the Grave
and Fugue from Bach’s Sonata No.
2 in A Minor for unaccompanied
violin; Beethoven’s Sonata No. 6 in
A, Op. 30, No. 1; and Bartok’s
Second Rhapsody. The Bartok,
played in memory of the composer
who died September 26, is a not
too spritely sequel to his first
rhapsody; it lacks the invention
and spontaneity of the first.
Stern Compared to Kreisler

I think that by 1950 Stern will
be the Kreisler of this generation.
Naturally when I liken Stern to
Kreisler, it is to Kreisler in his
prime (Circa 1927). He is the only
concert violinist of the day who
has a full resonance approaching
Kreisler’s and a breadth and purity
of tone matched by meticulous and
patrician phrasing, unmarred by
the oily swoops and slides which
characterize the Auer disciples,
Heifetz and Menuhin. This was
particularly evidenced in the Bach
unaccompanied sonata, and espec-
ially in the fugue, wher^the full-
ness of the sconoriiies emphasized
the polyphonic voices rather than
overshadowed them. In the 1943-
44 concert series, Mr. Stern played
Bach’s Sonata No. 1 in G Minor for
unaccompanied violin in its entire-
ty, and there too the same magni-
ficent conception prevailed in exe-
rution.

Talbot Annex has been having a prowler lately who wanders

House has recently seen a revival of the Druid cult and it is only
probably that the neo-Druids are out looking for a sacrificial victim.
Feuding is the order of the day with the Phi Sigs and the Pi Lams;
trophies have been “removed,” tear gas bombs and other missiles have

Hallowe'en"

The much-abused fountain in Hutchinson Court was again abused
on Hallowe’en when sundry pranksters filled it with red dye, the
remnants of which can still be seen. The same pranksters covered
campus that night more thoroughly than B & G and the results have
kept B & G busy since then. The C bench sported an immense gory
stain and a large sign in silver: CURSES ON THE FRESHMAN
WHO SAT HERE. (In other words, freshman, sophomores, and juniors
with certain exceptions simply do not sit on the C bench.) Another
bench situated under a large tree was adorned with a gaudy pair
of pajamas and a placard announcing that “Colonel Chidsey Slept
Here.” The entire campus was painted up—probably by Northwestern
since NORTHWESTERN was emblazoned in large green letters in
front of the Seal—as well as a snide remark about Plato.

Fraternities . . .

(Continued from Page 1)

tivities will be centered in the dormitories. Fraternities are for-
bidden from pledging students in the lower two years of the
college because of many National fraternity rulings. Hence, only
students in the last two years have been eligible. “The success
of the house plan depends, the report stated, on the leadership
of the older students” which would be lost if they were pledged
by fraternities.

No Ban in Divisions

On the basis that the University has no such comprehensive
extra-curricular plan in the divisions, the University will per-
mit the continuance of the social groups on the graduate level.
However, the official memorandum of the trustees pointed out
that “fraternities at this level, having men somewhat more
mature who are interested in fields of specialization, would be
different from the conventional pattern.” It recommended the
formation of chapters which might appeal to students in the
various schools of the University.

The University revealed that it has had the problem under
study since 1944. A 7-member faculty committee, including
six former fraternity members, recommended after 15 months
of deliberation, with one member dissenting, that the fra-
ternities should not continue. On July 12 the Board on Co-
ordination of Student Interests, a faculty-administrative board
of the Universtiy, unanimously approved the committee’s de-
cision. The verdict by the board, reached a week ago, followed.

The board permitted the continuance of the groups until
1947 in order to make possible a period of transition.

Report Cites Fraternity Contributions

Contributions which the fraternity system has made to the
University since its inception were cited by the report. It
emphasized “the growth in individual responsibility fostered
among fraternity men in which the older and more experienced
members acquired stature through supplying leadership and
guidance to their younger brothers.” It also pointed out that
fraternities assisted the Universtity when first founded with
its housing problems; brought many promising undergraduates
to the campus; and cemented alumni ties.

Since 1928, fraternities have steadily been declining at the
U. of C. Thirty-three chapters in 1928 with 751 members
dwindled to 15 organizations with 551 members in 1941 and
10 groups with about 250 pledges in 1945. Only three chapters
now maintain houses, though the houses leased by the organ-
izations to the University must be returned to the fraternities
by Spring, under terms of a contract negotiated before the war.

Fraternities, informed of the decision last night, have been
invited by the University to enter into discussions on the pos-
sibilities of reorganization along divisional lines.

On the Beam

On November 17, 1939, fellow
Czech and Slovak students
mourned the death of Jan Opletal,
a young medical student of
Prague’s Charles University, dead
of Nazi wounds. That night storm
troopers surrounded student hos-
tels. Students were dragged from
their dormitories, tortured, pound-
ed into submission and, by dawn
of the next day, the cold bodies
of 156 boys and girls hugged the
blood-stained streets.

Their living brother students
founded International Students
Day to commemorate their mem-
ory. It inspired the white youth
of the United Nations to fight on
the plains of France, the steppes
of Russia, the bills of Italy, and
on the islands of the Southwest
Pacific bringing the banner of
freedom back again to Prague. Can
freedom ever die with such heroes?
Reunion taking place

At this moment in free Prague
a World Student Congress with
American representatives is being
held on the same spot where the
156 students were massacred. A
revitalized spirit will sweep
throughout the world as these
students renew pledges of friend-
ship and unity.

Today we are building a future
world where free men may be
peacefully secure from aggression
and force. We again echo the words
of Franklin D. Roosevelt: “In ob-
serving November 17 ... as In-
ternational Students Day, Ameri-
can youth joins with youth of all
freedom-loving nations in pledging
itself anew to those tasks and to
the faith in the world of tomorrow
toward which we now advance.”
Something new added

A new level of international
spirit has been developed on the
campus as an International Stu-
dents Day Committee represent-
ing every political, social and re-
ligious club was set up to com-
memorate “I.S.Day.” Let us hope
that this unity in the spirit of
Roosevelt, will continue. This col-
umn, On the Beam salutes the new
feeling of campus-wide unity. Stu-
dents must be ready to defend this
unity long overdue, against its
enemies from within and from
without.

It is extremely important that
the “International” phase of the
commemoration be stressed. Vague

(Continued from Page 1)
thorities have announced that a
$2,000,000 structure will be built
to house the Nuclear Physics In-
stitute. Nobel prize winner Enrico
Fermi, Italian genius who has been
hailed by his colleagues as the
world’s foremost physicist, and
Harold C. Urey, outstanding Amer-
ican scientist who won the Nobel
prize tor his research on a heavy
hydrogen, head a contingent of 30
scientists who will study and teach
here. Prof. Samuel K. Allison, one
of the key investigators and Co-
Director of the Los Alamos project,
will direct the institute.

$1,500,000 has already been ear-
marked for the metallurgy project
now housed in Eckhart and addi-
tional funds will be appropriated
once decisions have been reached
in Washington.

Prof. Raymond E. Zirkle and a
group of associate scientists who
applied atomic techniques to the
study of living organisms and their
ills will found an institute of
Radiobiology and Biophysics.

Meantime the Federation of
Atomic Scientists which includes
many U. of C. investigators, has
sent scientists on nationwide
speaking tours. Chancellor Robert
M. Hutchins, Vice-President
Reuben C. Gustavson, and Robert
C. Redfield, dean of the Social
Sciences, have been among the I
most outspoken American educa-
tors in demanding the formulation
of an A-bomb policy.

Scientists Rap Bill

The scientists charge that the
May-Johnson bill, if passed, would
“jeopardize democratic institu-
tions” and muzzle scientific inquiry
not only in physics but in associated
fields. They further claim that pas-

.	_	.	.............

H

sage of the bill can only lead to an
international armaments race and
seriously handicap the formulation
of a United Nations. The bill pro-
vides for a 9-man commission
which would have complete control
over scientific, medical, and in-
dustrial research relating to atomic
energy. The commission may with-
hold materials and investigating
rights to any group. Presumably
it will be headed by an army
officer.

If the May-Johnson Bill is pass-
ed in its current form, THE CHI-
CAGO MAROON has learned on
the highest authority that the in-
stitutes here may be seriously im-
paired.

Meanwhile as the.full story of
man’s mightiest weapon was un-
raveled if became evident that the
U. of C. had played the key role
in its discovery. If Waterloo was
won on the playing fields of Eton,
World. War II was won on Dec. 2,
1942, on a squash court at Stagg
Field. For it was here that Fermi
set off the first self-maintaining
nucleur chain reaction.

The Smyth report, the official
government summary of state-
ments by independent investiga-
tors and writers, all point to the
tremendous role played by Chi-
cago in research on atomic fission.
Those salient points include:

1) The vital role played by
Chancellor Hutchins, the Board of
Trustees, and the Departments of
Physical Sciences in the project.
In 1943 Hutchins gambled the fate
of the world and the future of the
University in consenting to permit
the U. of C. to channel its energy
into the direction of the large scale
scientific and industrial effort nec-
essary to the bomb’s production.
Other Universities, including such
institutions as Harvard and M. I.
T., had spurned the army proposal,
as had many industrialists. Scores
of laboratories, offices, housing
space, and a vast share of the
University budget was devoted to
the project. The trustees permit-
ted Hutchins to commit the Univer-
sity without knowledge of the part
he had drafted with the army.
Weeks afterwards the War De-
partment permitted Hutchins to
reveal the secret to several high
University administrators. Dr.
Arthur Holly Compton, former

Dean of the Physical Science Di-
vision, directed the entire research
project, assisted by Fermi, Urey
and other prominent American in-
vestigators. Dr. Leo Szilard, sci-
entist here, summarized Chicago’s
role in the bomb when in testify-
ing before a senate committee he
said that “the U. of C. was to the
atom bomb what the Bell Labora-
tories are to the telephone.’’

2) the story of the chain reaction
on the squash court under the
steel tiers at Stagg Field is one of
the most dramatic tales of the war.
The war department described it
as the turning point of the project.
On the morning of Dec. 2 students
passed on their way to classes and
in nearby Bartlett navymen moved
thru drills. On one of the squash
courts a strange, knoblike appa-
ratus had been set up. It was built
of graphite bricks with lumps of
uranium oxide imbedded in the
corners. At Fermi’s instruction
Prof. Walter Zinn “pulled out the
control rod, the neutrons came
faster and faster, increasing until
there was fear of damage. . . .
The suicide squad, prepared to de-
stroy the pile to save the city in a

one - in - a - million - chance of
threatened explosion breathed
sigh of relief. The half watt
power thus generated, Compton

a
a
of
in

a report later wrote, was the per-
cursor of the Atomic Age.

3) It was on the basis of this
microscopic research that a pilot
plant was built by DuPont at Clin-

BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM

"Service to the Nation in Peace and War”



ton, Tenn., and another at Han-
ford, Wash. Construction and de-
signing of the atom equipment
in both plants was under the di-
rect supervision of Chicago scien-
tists.

4) All of the fundamental health
measures developed in connection
with the bomb were the result of
research by U. of C. biologists and
biophysicists headed by Zirkle.
The precautions against radioac-
tivity with “Pluto” which meas-
ured the alpha-emitting contami-
nation, and of “Sneezy,” which
measured the concentration of ra-
dioactive dust were products of
Quadrangle research as were the
effects of radioactivity on the hor-
mones and genes and defenses
against industrial poisons.

Other Universities Collaborated

Numerous other Universities
collaborated with Chicago as the
focus point. Fermi came to Chi-
cago from Princeton and Colum-
bia and Urey from Columbia.
Other vital research was carried
on at California and at the Los
Alamos Laboratories headed -by
Prof. J. R. Openheimer.

Chicago scientists were the first
to urge action on controlling the
bomb. Compton relates that during
the investigation many of the sci-
entists hoped the secret would
never be discovered. A round-
robin petition on Sept. 9 bearing
the names of 64 U. of C. scientists
urging that atom bomb data be
shared first exploded the issue.

King Football returned to the Uni
versify of Chicago campus this
fall for the first time in six years.
For the first time since the days
of Coach Clark Shaughnessy and
Captain Lew Hamity, shoulder-
pads and hip-pads came off the
dusty shelves to be put to the use
for which they were originally
intended.

To be sure, it is only intra-mur-
al football—inter-collegiate games
seem as far away as ever—but
on the other hand no one expects
to see the brand of play that
characterized the teams coached
by the immortal A. Alonzo Stagg
or even those led by All-Ameri-
can Jay Berwanger. Old timers
might well smile indulgently at
the clumsy tackles, at the blocks
that were missed, but let no man
question the spirit animating each
player.

Original plans as suggested by
the Athletic Department call for
an eight-team league, represent-
ing each of the eight houses at
Burton-Judson Court. The inabil-
ity of two of the entries to muster
enough men for a full team leave
only Mathews, Coulter, Dodd.
Linn, Salisbury, and Chamberlain
to compete against each other for
the coveted championship. A five-
week schedule has been drawn
up, providing each team with an
opportunity to play every other
team.

Under the supervision of various
coaches selected from the Ath-
letic Department, practice began
two weeks before the opening
kick-off.

Since most of the fellows had
never played in organized foot-
ball before, fundamentals such as
blocking and tackling were stres-
sed. Each team employs the same
plays and all operate from the dif-
ficult ‘T’ formation. An epidemic
of sprained ankles and broken
noses during the first week or
two threatened to put a stop to
the league before it had achieved
any real organization, but with
practice came skill, and eventually
fewer doctor bills.

new football setup as the first

a New York publishing firm.

Mr. Couch, son of a Baptist
minister, was born in Pamplin,
Virginia, 44 years ago and received
his college education at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina. He be-
came assistant director of the
North Carolina Press in 1925, and
director in 1932.

After a little more than a month

Coed Contests

by Vlack

Hotly contested games of hock- any indication, the finals will be

step toward an increased emphasis
on intra-mural athletics. From
now on all such activities within
the college will be carried on
through the organization of the
men’s dormitories. This is in line
with the University’s avowed pol-
icy of promoting athletics for the
sake of the player and not for the
spectator.

ey, tennis, and table tennis are in
order all this and next week as
the final games in the women’s
interhouse tournaments are play-
ed. Based on the new system of
a house sports manager with
sports representatives for individ-
ual activities, participation in
women’s sports has risen sharply.
Heavy turnouts are expected for
the volleyball tournament and the
swimming meet which are to be
held later in the quarter.

Playoffs in the table tennis
tournaments are being held Mon-
day and Friday nights on the sec-
ond floor of Ida Noyes starting
at 7:00 p.m. Kelly and Beecher

T. Nelson Metcalf returned to
the University of Chicago this
quarter to resume his duties as
Athletic Director. Since Septem-
ber 1942, he has been on leave
of absence to the Navy as officer
in charge of physical training for
the Ninth Naval District.

Mr. Metcalf graduated from
Oberlin College in 1912. He re-
ceived his B.A. and M.A. in physi-
cal Education from Oberlin. While
he was there he played tackle and
end on the football team and ran
distance for the track team. In
1912 he set the Western Confer-
ence Two Mile Record at 9:42.8
and the Ohio .Conference Mile
Record at 4:25.6. Since his college

days he has held coaching posi-
tions at Oberlin, Columbia, Min-
nesota, Iowa State and Chicago,
and has been active in such*’ groups
as the N.C.A.A. where he was
chairman of the Track and Field
Committee for many years, and
the American Olympic Association
Games Committee of which he
is Secretary.

John J. Berwanger has returned
to the University of Chicago as a
part time coach for the Intramur-
al football season after receiving
an honorable discharge from the
Navy, in which he served as a
Lieutenant Commander in the Air
Force.

Jay came to Chicago in 1932

from Dubuque High School where
he made quite a name for him-
self scholastically and athletically.
In 1933 he played more minutes
of Big Ten football than any other
man in the conference. In nis
junior and senior years he be-
came a campus legend, running
wild over Stagg Field and making
fools out of the so called “stars”
of the day. In 1935 he was chosen
All-American left halfback by all
of the major sports polls in the
country. He was graduated from
the School of Business in 1936
with high standing.

NATION-WIDE



Chicago returns
to Big Ten

The University of Chicago re-
turns this quarter to the Big Ten
after a year without conference
competition. Last presented with
serious manpower shortages in the
fail of 1943, the Athletic Depart-
ment decided not to disrupt the
whole Western Conference thru
the possible inability to have a
team. This year basketball, base-
ball, and track schedules have al-
ready been made up and the
others will be done in the early
part of December.

Player's Quild Launches Season Tonight

Winterset'

Chart New

First Play

Winterset, the only major
dramatic offering of the Au
tumn Quarter, will open to-
night in Mandel Hall at 8:30
p.m. under the auspices of the
Player’s Guild. The all-student
cast, directed by Marvin B.
Peisner, will act in Maxwell
Anderson’s poetic drama Satur-
day night as well as November
22 and 23.

The two leading roles in Win-
terset will be played by Sylvia
Farnham and Philip Kirton, stu-
dents in the fourth year of the
College, who are making their
first appearance on the Mandel
Hall stage. Mr. Peisner, Players
Guild director for five months,
turns actor as well as director in
his second production to take the
part of Judge Gaunt. Among the
supporting actors are Malcolm
Provus, George Morrison, Curt
Gram, Roy Pakensky, Herbert
-Baer, Eugene Hutchen, and Her-
bert Neuer. Elizabeth Risinger,
David Hall, Donald Winks, Jean
Cooke, Roberta Unger, Helen
Auerbach, Ana Le Leon, Harvey
Ross and George Weber complete
the cast list.

This drama, in verse, about the
plight of two young people who
fall in love and are caught in the
sordid workings of crime and
punishment, was proclaimed by
critics as “the most important play
of the season . . . most notable
effort in the poetic drama medium
that we have had in the American
theatre.” It was first produced on
Broadway in 1935 with Burgess
Meredith in the leading role, and
it has since been played with great
success in little theatres all over
the country.

Plan Here

For O.D.P

Co-directors of the dramatics
office, Marvin B. Peisner and
Martha McCain have announced
their decision to change the name
of the organization from the Office
of Dramatic Productions to Play-
ers Guild. Before the advent of the
three year old consolidation of
campus actors into the Office of
Dramatic Productions, the theatri-
cal groups were known as Univer-
sity Players and Dramatic Activi-
ties.

Mr. Peisner and Mrs. McCain,
acting in accordance with the new
and enlarged activities program,
have extended the dramatics
schedule for the year. Major Play-
ers Guild productions will be
given four nights in Mandel Hall,
instead of the usual two, in order
to give the actors more experience.

Under the direction of Martha
McCain, an experimental theatre
has been organized to train stu-
dents for work in the larger Play-
ers Guild performances. Mrs. Mc-
Cain has given “The Monkey’s
Paw” and “The Twelve- Pound
Look,” and is now casting “Riders
to the Sea” and “Suppressed De-

sires.” These one-act
admission free and are
in the afternoons.

The group originally

plays are
presented

known as

the Experimental’ Theatre, which
last year presented “The Aston-
ished Heart” and “The Stronger,”
has re-established itself this year

Proceeding as they have in the
past with student directors and
complete student organization, the
group plans to give the campus a
type of theatre that has been neg-
lected hereabouts. Clifford Odet’s
“Rocket To The Moon” will be
presented by them in the Reynolds
Club toward the end of the au-
tumn quarter, and plays for the
winter quarter are now being
scheduled.

Summer Brings
Major Changes

Discovery of the atomic bomb and a general administrative
reorganization that raised Robert M. Hutchins to the newly
created post of chancellor were the major events of the summer

quarter.

Succeeding Hutchins as President
is Ernest C. Colwell, formerly vice-
president and dean of the faculties.
Reuben G. Gustavson, former
president of the University of Colo-
rado and internationally known
chemist fills the position left va-
cant by Colwell. Two other vice-
presidents are responsible to the
chancellor; they are Wilbur C.
Munnecke, Vice - President in
charge of Business Affairs and
Neil H. Jacoby, former secretary
of the University, who is now

Vice-President in charge of Devel-
opment.

Hutchins Explains Change

This unique change, Hutchins
explained, is to turn over many of
the demands unrelated to the edu-
cational and administrative re-
sponsibilities of the chief executive
to the president, leaving the chan-
cellor free to “plan for and admin-
ister the University as a whole
through a well-coordinated group
of officers who have definitely de-
fined responsibilities.”

petitions urging the severance of
U. S. diplomatic relations with
Argentina, sponsored Dr. Dryden
Phelps speaking on the “Chinese
Youth Movement,” and initiated
the idea of International Students’
Day on this campus.

Currently, campaigns are being
planned to urge a minimum
campus wage of 65 cents per hour
and speedier demobilization of
the armed forces.

Socialist Study Club

Activities of the Socialist Study
Club were brought to campus at-
tention last Tuesday with the pub-
lication of the first issue of a new
student Socialist newspaper, “The
Torch.”

In addition to its regular meet-
ings and publishing activities the
club has also found time to circu-
late petitions against peacetime
conscription, and plan two study
series: one on socialist economics
and the other on the nature of a
socialist economy.
