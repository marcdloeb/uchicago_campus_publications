New Quad Club

Rules Proposed

Members of the Quadrangle Club
will vote Monday night on a series of
proposed amendments to the Gub’s
constitution which would consider-
ably relax membership requirements.

Principal provisions of the amend-
ments would make membership auto-
matic for any member of the Uni-
versity faculty or staff who applies,
and would make membership avail-
able to both men and women, instead
of to men only, as at present. At
present, every applicant must be
voted on by the Club council, and two
adverse votes are sufficient to reject
the application.

The present provision allowing
blackball of applicants who are not
members of the University would be
retained. Other changes proposed in-
clude the extension qf club privileges
to all adults of the members’ families,
instead of to their wives only.

The proposed amendments have
been initiated by W. C. Allee, A. J.
Carlson, G. V. Cox, C. W. Gilkey,
Walter Johnson, Robert Redfield, W.
L. Warner, H. N. Wieman, and
Louis Wirth.

Last year’s rejection of the mem-
bership application of Gordon Dupee,
Research Director of the University
Radio Office, caused serious protests
by certain members of the club, and
resulted in the resignation of Presi-
dent Hutchins.

Caniff, in wiring his selection to
Sigma Chi Sweetheart chairman, as-
serted that after studying the photo-
graphs “I felt as I had just looked
through the personal wallets of 20
brothers. Such a muster of slick
chicks is very confusing,” he added.

“The winner must be chosen or its
no contest,” Caniff declared, “so I
cast my ballot for Miss Ellen O’Con-

Universities Established

For Servicemen Overseas

By ALAN J. STRAUSS
(Exclusive to THE CHICAGO
MAROON)

Merle C. Coulter, Professor of
Botany and Chairman of Biolog-
ical Sciences 3 in the College,
has been called overseas for
Army educational work, THE
CHICAGO MAROON learned
yesterday from official Washing-
ton sources.

Professor Coulter, nationally emi-
nent biologist who is now in Washing-
ton, but will return to Chicago be-
fore leaving the United States, will
join the faculty of an Army univer-
sity to be established at Shrivenham,
England, for troops stationed in the
European theater of operations.
Classes for 4,000 service men and
women are scheduled to begin late in
July. Courses will be eight weeks in
length. Coulter has been granted
leave to accept the post.

The University of Shrivenham, and
another planned for an unannounced
location in France, are being estab-
lished as part of a comprehensive
educational program announced this
week by General Dwight D. Eisen-
hower for occupation forces in the
European theater and troops waiting
transportation back to this country.
Students will be selected for attend-
ance by means of screening tests
throughout the theater from among
those whose unit commanders release
them from their present duties.

Faculties of both universities will
consist principally of civilian profes-
sors now being recruited in schools
of liberal arts, science, engineering,
fine arts, music, and journalism,
throughout the country. They will
receive no military rank, but will re-
tain civilian status.

Under the program just announced,
qualified troops will also be allowed
to attend such famous civilian uni-

THE CHICAGO MAROON

Editorial

Who Fails?

Two weeks ago. Maroon staff car-
toonist George Armstrong penned a
brilliant caricature of the Board of
Examiners in the midst of concocting
further devilry and tarnation for U. of
C. undergraduates. While the Uni-
versity has constantly maintained
that comprehensive examinations are
a means to an end and not an end in
themselves, it is unquestionably true
that the final examination today oc-
cupies a more prominent role in the
University scheme of things than
ever before.

The current college curriculum has
been founded on the tenet that a
liberal education will prepare an in-
dividual for citizenship in a demo-
cratic society. Furthermore, we have
aserted that students are not capable
of selecting the courses of study which
should comprise said education,
and therefore such courses should be
determined by men of experience and
training.

Under such premises, the fears of
failing a comprehensive examination
and the psychology of the comprehen-
sives have become completely falla-
cious and misleading. If students
fail in college, it is the College which
has failed, for the admnistration has
asserted that every man can absorb
a liberal education.

If students do not appear to have
the ability to comprehend the courses,
then the methods of teaching are at
fault. If they possess the ability but
refuse to make the necessary effort,
as is often charged, it is then the re-
sponsibility of the College to con-
vince them of the necessity and
urgency for making that effort.

The cry of education in America
for nearly a generation has been that
students must have the opportunity
to make choices. Such a platform
is a hollow mockery, for choices are
useless if they are not made intelli-
gently. If, as this University has
maintained, students cannot select
the courses they should take, we may
then ask whether they can be expected
to choose to study the courses so care-
fully outlined for them?

For unless the necessity of obtain-
ing such an education is perfectly
evident, a student weighs the possi-
bilities of hard work and no profit,
and little work and no profit. The
choice is an obvious one.

It is incumbent upon the faculty
and the administration to clarify the
necessity and to make students of
the University understand that the
choice is not one of work or no work,
but of profit and success, or of loss
and failure.

Hail Armstrong, Prophet

Several weeks ago the Maroon published an Armstrong car-
toon of dinner at the Commons, a prime feature of which was
the astounded student pulling a mouse out of the stew. Last
week a group of students went into the Commons—and found a
mouse, a very small one, which they put in a glass. He’s now an
honored denizen of Rosenwald. Aside to delicate eaters: the
mouse really wasn’t in the stew.

People

Everett Walker, head of the 200 Entry, will be married soon.. .Jeanne
Schlageter has returned from California with an enviable tan.. .Hitchhiking
seems to be the after-comp rage: Don Johnson is hitching home to Detroit;
Tex Morgan and Phil Vollmer left Friday thumbing their way to Texas
(later they’re going to California to see Tex’s uncle who is a writer for Bob
Hope). Phil is going into the Navy August 1. Steve Llewellyn is back in
the states—he called Lois from New Jersey Wednesday night... Betsy Wal-
lace’s engagement has been announced.

Male Vanity

At Hitchcock the other day one of the ASTP’s appeared looking inor-
dinately pleased with his sartorial splendor—he’d just bought an overseas
jacket. Within three hours no less than forty other men appeared in brand
new overseas jackets, ranging from the $7.00 variety to the $40.00 deluxe
variety. Finally, someone, either disappointed at not being able to purchase
one or afflicted with a sense of the ridiculous, posted a notice on the board:
“There will be a meeting of all bellhops at ten tonight. Jackets will be worn.”
Additions to Superman Myth

We perused the article in “Seventeen” about the University and the
College Plan and found that the Hutchins Myth is still being augmented.
We quote: “President Hutchins, of the University of Chicago, has planned
the liberal education course at the college very carefully.” Single-handed?
“President Hutchins and his faculty have a faith in teen-agers, and that
faith is being proved correct. There’s no telling what the University of
Chicago’s revolutionary plan will do to the future of education.”
Odds and Ends

Another article about the University, this time concerning the veterans’
organization on campus, will appear in the June 29 issue of Yank . . . The
After Comp Dance should be interesting—we wonder whether people will
have recovered sufficiently from comps to exert the immense physical effort
of dancing... Incidentally, the proctors at the comps are becoming publicity
hungry. We hear that ever since we published the remarks of one jocose
gentleman all the others have been making feeble wisecracks for the benefit
of all Maroon reporters present. Tsk.

Letters to Editor

University Masks Tuition
Hike With Subterfuge, 27
Students Claim In Letter

To the Editor:

The recent increase in tuition and fees to become effective
next quarter has provoked discussion leading to crystallization
of the following points.

1.	Tuition as such has been raised from $100 to $110, and fees have
been raised from a former minimum of $6 to a flat $20 per quarter. If the
University feels that it is entitled to such a large increase in tuition, why
put so much of it under the guise of “fees”? The fact that graduation,
thesis, and laboratory fees have been eliminated by this new procedure
means almost nothing to most students who, in the course of four years,
will have paid far more in this manner than before.

2.	Most students believe that the present practice of pro-rating labora-
tory courses for which a student is registered is equitable. If the University
needs more money, we are sure that those students taking laboratory courses
would agree that it would be more justifiable to increase their fees than to
require students not in the sciences to pay for that which they will not
receive. Laboratory fees should continue to be pro-rated.

3.	The new tuition scale will tend virtually to discourage those students
who find it necessary to work and can take only one course at a time.
No one will dispute the right of the University to raise tuition by $5 per
course, but to charge a $20 fee for one course when other students pay the
same fee for three or four courses is more than a little unfair. For three
courses at that rate, it amounts to paying $180 as opposed to $130, if these
courses were taken simultaneously. Here again fees ought to be pro-rated
according to the number of courses for which a student is registered at
the time. If the purpose of this inequitable distribution of fees is to
discourage the part time student entirely, we believe this action inconsistent
with the expressed ideals of this university.

4.	Tuition in University College is up by $5 per course also, but fees
are up from a minimum of $2 (if no laboratory course is taken) to a flat $10.
For some students this amounts to an increase of 500% and for those
taking one laboratory course, to an increase of 200% in fees. Students in
University College rarely take more than one course per quarter; some ad-
justment obviously ought to be made.

5.	The alleged increase in funds for tuition aid cannot possibly cover
all those who need aid as a result of the announced raise in tuition fees.
In addition, these funds may be applied toward neither the so-called “fee,”
nor the tuition of the part-time student.

The reactions of students and faculty to this statement, as set forth in
the above five points, are invited by the undersigned.

perilously close to marring that
record yesterday, but they finally
salvaged a 7-6 decision in the last
half of the ninth inning at Green-

Assistant Coach Joe Stampf,
former Maroon all - conference

in driving home Nick Paresi,
intra-mural director, in the last
half of the ninth inning to break
a 6-6 tie.

Four members of the Maroon
team which played in Japan in
1930 and Ellidor Libonati, secre-

has missed one game since 1911,
took part in yesterday’s game.

New Quad Club

Rules Proposed

Members of the Quadrangle Club
will vote Monday night on a series of
proposed amendments to the Club’s
constitution which would consider-
ably relax membership requirements.

Principal provisions of the amend-
ments would make membership auto-
matic for any member of the Uni-
versity faculty or staff who applies,
and would make membership avail-
able to both men and women, instead
of to men only, as at present. At
present, every applicant must be
voted on by the Club council, and two
adverse votes are sufficient to reject
the application.

The present provision allowing
blackball of applicants who are not
members of the University would be
retained. Other changes proposed in-
clude the extension of club privileges
to all adults of the members’ families,
instead of to their wives only.

The proposed amendments have
been initiated by W. C. Allee, A. J.
Carlson, G. V. Cox, C. W. Gilkey,
Walter Johnson, Robert Redfield, W.
L. Warner, H. N. Wieman, and
Louis Wirth.

Last year’s rejection of the mem-
bership application of Gordon Dupee,
Research Director of the University
Radio Office, caused serious protests
by certain members of the club, and
resulted in the resignation of Presi-
dent Hutchins.

Caniff, in wiring his selection to
Sigma Chi Sweetheart chairman, as-
serted that after studying the photo-
graphs “I felt as I had just looked
through the personal wallets of 20
brothers. Such a muster of slick

Editorial

Whi Fails?

Two weeks ago, Maroon staff car-
toonist George Armstrong penned a
brilliant caricature of the Board of
Examiners in the midst of concocting
further devilry and tarnation for U. of
C. undergraduates. While the Uni-
versity has constantly maintained
that comprehensive examinations are
a means to an end and not an end in
themselves, it is unquestionably true
that the final examination today oc-
cupies a more prominent role in the
University scheme of things than
ever before.

The current college curriculum has
been founded on the tenet that a
liberal education will prepare an in-
dividual for citizenship in a demo-
cratic society. Furthermore, we have
aserted that students are not capable
of selecting the courses of study which
should comprise said education,
and therefore such courses should be
determined by men of experience and
training.

Under such premises, the fears of
failing a comprehensive examination
and the psychology of the comprehen-
sives have become completely falla-
cious and misleading. If students
fail in college, it is the College which
has failed, for the admnistration has
asserted that every man can absorb
a liberal education.

If students do not appear to have
the ability to comprehend the courses,
then the methods of teaching are at
fault. If they possess the ability but
refuse to make the necessary effort,
as is often charged, it is then the re-
sponsibility of the College to con-
vince them of the necessity and
urgency for making that effort.

The cry of education in America
for nearly a generation has been that
students must have the opportunity
to make choices. Such a platform
is a hollow mockery, for choices are
useless if they are not made intelli-
gently. If, as this University has
maintained, students cannot select
the courses they should take, we may
then ask whether they can be expected
to choose to study the courses so care-
fully outlined for them?

For unless the necessity of obtain-
ing such an education is perfectly
evident, a student weighs the possi-
bilities of hard work and no profit,
and little work and no profit. The
choice is an obvious one.

It is incumbent upon the faculty
and the administration to clarify the
necessity and to make students of
the University understand that the
choice is not one of work or no work,
but of profit and success, or of loss
and failure.

Several weeks ago the Maroon published an Armstrong car-
toon of dinner at the Commons, a prime feature of which was
the astounded student pulling a mouse out of the stew. Last
week a group of students went into the Commons—and found a
mouse, a very small one, which they put in a glass. He’s now an
honored denizen of Rosenwald. Aside to delicate eaters: the
mouse really wasn’t in the stew.

new overseas jackets, ranging from the $7.00 variety to the $40.00 deluxe
variety. Finally, someone, either disappointed at not being able to purchase
one or afflicted with a sense of the ridiculous, posted a notice on the board:
“There will be a meeting of all bellhops at ten tonight. Jackets will be worn.”
Additions to Superman Myth

We perused the article in “Seventeen” about the University and the
College Plan and found that the Hutchins Myth is still being augmented.
We quote: “President Hutchins, of the University of Chicago, has planned
the liberal education course at the college very carefully.” Single-handed?
“President Hutchins and his faculty have a faith in teen-agers, and that
faith is being proved correct. There’s no telling what the University of
Chicago’s revolutionary plan will do to the future of education.”

Letters to Editor

University Masks Tuition
Hike With Subterfuge, 27
Students Claim In Letter

To the Editor:

The recent increase in tuition and fees to become effective
next quarter has provoked discussion leading to crystallization
of the following points.

1.	Tuition as such has been raised from $100 to $110, and fees have
been raised from a former minimum of $6 to a flat $20 per quarter. If the
University feels that it is entitled to such a large increase in tuition, why
put so much of it under the guise of “fees”? The fact that graduation,
thesis, and laboratory fees have been eliminated by this new procedure
means almost nothing to most students who, in the course of four years,
will have paid far more in this manner than before.

2.	Most students believe that the present practice of pro-rating labora-
tory courses for which a student is registered is equitable. If the University
needs more money, we are sure that those students taking laboratory courses
would agree that it would be more justifiable to increase their fees than to
require students not in the sciences to pay for that which they will not
receive. Laboratory fees should continue to be pro-rated.

3.	The new tuition scale will tend virtually to discourage those students
who find it necessary to work and can take only one course at a time.
No one will dispute the right of the University to raise tuition by $5 per
course, but to charge a $20 fee for one course when other students pay the
same fee for three or four courses is more than a little unfair. For three
courses at that rate, it amounts to paying $180 as opposed to $130, if these
courses were taken simultaneously. Here again fees ought to be pro-rated
according to the number of courses for which a student is registered at
the time. If the purpose of this inequitable distribution of fees is to
discourage the part time student entirely, we believe this action inconsistent
with the expressed ideals of this university.

4.	Tuition in University College is up by $5 per course also, but fees
are up from a minimum of $2 (if no laboratory course is taken) to a flat $10.
For some students this amounts to an increase of 500% and for those
taking one laboratory course, to an increase of 200% in fees. Students in
University College rarely take more than one course per quarter; some ad-
justment obviously ought to be made.

5.	The alleged increase in funds for tuition aid cannot possibly cover
all those who need aid as a result of the announced raise in tuition fees.
In addition, these funds may be applied toward neither the so-called “fee,”
nor the tuition of the part-time student.

The reactions of students and faculty to this statement, as set forth in
the above five points, are invited by the undersigned.

salvaged a 7-6 decision in the last

Committee . . . political science student who hopes

to go overseas with the Red Cross or A MG after

she wins her diploma in September,

Small wonder, when she’s so close to her goal, that she’s]]
absolutely up-in-the-clouds (pun!) . . . that she was
so taken with this cloud print she found in the Misses'
Dress Shop at Marshall Field & Company. Doesn’t
she look heavenly in it . . . and isn’t it the dress perfect
for off-campus dates during the summer quarter?

You’d like it for your own? Try it on and you’ll be doubly
sure . . . because it’s not only pretty, it’s blessedly cool
(you can thank the low U-neck, the short cap sleeves,
the tissue weight fabric—rayon crepe—for that).

White clouds on sky blue or midnight black ... sizes 10 to 20.
