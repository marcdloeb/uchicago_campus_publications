STUDENT GOVERNMENT PROGRESSES

CAMPUS FUROR OVER

Second Discussion Scheduled

PEACE DRAFT MOUNTS

The anti-postwar military conscription faction held the upper
hand on the Quadrangles this week in the verbal battle over
postwar army duty, but the question will be stoked and fired up
again tonight at 8 p.m. in Oriental Institute.

Enrollment Is
Hiked; Credit
GIs^ New Plan

Return of veterans under the
GI plan coupled with the increas-
ing success of the four-year col-
lege plan today was credited with
the 20 per cent spurt in attend-
ance of the University over Jan-
uary of last year.

Earnest C. Miller, registrar, an-
nounced this week that the total en-
rollment at the university is 5,045 as
compared to 4,197 at the beginning
of the winter quarter last year. Of
this total, 1,680 students, an increase
of over 42 per cent, have entered the
college, a statement released by
Miller indicated.

*

Coincident with the rise in civilian
attendance, the one-time widespread
army and navy training'program on
the campus has been diminished with
the end of the program in sight. Two
hundred sixty-nine service students
still remain on the campus. A break-
down of figures discloses that 3 are
Navy V-12 students, 78 with A.S.T.P.,
and 188 are Army and Navy medical
matriculants.

Most notable advances in the Uni-
versity attendance rosters were rec-
orded in the divisional schools with
the school of medicine increasing 75
per cent over last year and the law
school soaring to a new high, 48 per
cent over a year ago. The total boost
in the divisional enrollment as re-
ported by Miller was 13.54 per cent.

"Showboat"
For C-Dance

Opening its activities for the winter
quarter, the Student Social Committee
presents a Showboat party tomorrow
evening in Ida Noyes gym. The
Showboat lifts anchor at 9:00 p.m. and
docks at 12:00; fare is 60c. A cos-
tumed show in the old Mississippi
style begins at 10:30, with Maynard
Wishner taking over the M.C. duties.
The program features an old fashion-
ed mixed quartette; songs from
“Showboat’1 sung by Ted Rall; a ma-
gician, Chuck Barlow; and a “Mr.
Bones” act featuring Charles
Schwartz and Chuck Grant.

Parker Melling and his band will be
an hand to furnish the music. A coke
bar will be set up for the evening.

Joan Beckman and Bob Weber, co-
chairmen of the dance, have set out
the welcome mat for everyone—stags
too.

The Social Committee, headed by
Ernestine Rowe, has recently added
two new members, Bob Weber and
Marty Hylick. Further additions to
the group are being contemplated.

The Socialist club reaffirmed its op-
position and Labor Rights will air the
issue -in a debate tonight spotlighting
Wilbur G. Munnecke, vice-president
of the University, Milton Mayer, “be-
hind the scenes” administration offi-
cial, and Mortimer J. Adler, professor
of philosophy. Munnecke will uphold
the affirmative and Mayer will debate
the negative with Adler acting as me-
diator. The general public is invited.

Labor Rights is expected to frame
a resolution embodying its views at
the conclusion of the meeting or at
a later session.

Other University groups are plan-
ning discussions on the question, while
a number of professors and adminis-
trative authorities have already taken
stands.

At the Socialist Club meeting on
Monday, Ann Morrissett and Virgil
Vogel discussed “Peace-time Military
Conscription.” Vogel and Mary Shan-
non, who were two of the defendants
in the Loop poster-walk arrest Satur-
day, told of the case of the ten Young
People’s Socialist League members
who were arrested while peacefully
demonstrating against peace-time
conscription with signs and placards
in the Loop. Charges against eight
of the defendants were subsequently
dismissed, but two-the two YPSL or-
ganizers, Vogel, a student of the Uni-
versity and Irwin Suall of New York,
who spoke on January fifteenth for
the Socialist Club—were fined $25
each as the “instigators” and “lead-
ers.”

Francis Heisler, labor lawyer for
the United Retail, Wholesale, and
Department Store Employees against
Sewell Avery of Montgomery Ward
and counsel for the defense, is ap-
pealing the case on the grounds that
the two were no more guilty than
the eight who were released and that
they must not be allowed to serve as
scapegoats for policemen’s mistakes

150 New Students Enter University

On Thursday, approximately 150
students will attend classes in the
College for the first time. Enrollment
at mid-year was limited, due to war-
time lack of facilities. Consequently,
only 50 pupils will enter the first and
second years of the College and about
100 are expected to register for the
third and fourth years.

An orientation program has been
planned for the three days preceding
classes to acquaint the new students
with the University. Under the di-
rection of Norman F. Maclean, Dean
of Students in the College, the stu-
dent orientation board has planned
several social events to supplement
the required tests and registration.

Various addresses of welcome to
the new students at their first meet-
ing on campus, will be followed by
two days of placement tests. Recep-
tions in the dormitories, and a barn
dance on Tuesday evening are ex-
pected to relieve the strain of the

KATHERINE DUNHAM

Kate Dunham

Here Monday

Students of the University will
gather at Ida Noyes library next Mon-
day afternoon, January 29, from 4:00
till 6:00, at a tea honoring the return
of celebrated alumna and famed ex-
ponent of primitive dance, Katherine
Dunham.

Present also will be Roger Ohardie-
no and Tommy Gomez, performers of
Miss Dunham’s “Rites de Passage”
sequence, and other outstanding mem-
bers of the Dunham troupe.

This event is being sponsored by
the Negro Student Club and the Chi-
cago Maroon, and all interested mem-
bers of the University are welcomed.

Miss Dunham is presenting a re-
vised “Tropical Review” for a limited
engagement at the Studebaker Thea-
ter. Her primitive dances remain a
unique presentation in the American
theater and never cease to promise
a fascinating evening of entertain-
ment.

exams.

Registration of the new students
has been set for Wednesday, when,
they will also be taken on sight-seeing
tours of the University. That even-
ing, Activities Night, will give the
new pupils an opportunity to discuss
individual interests with leaders of
student activities.

During this orientation, the new-
comers will be tested to determine
the courses each will need. They will
also be given medical examinations
and time to confer about sports
and recreation with representatives

The all-campus social calendar
will be available next Week. Cop-
ies can be obtained at the Ida Noyes
check room or the information
desk of the Press Building. This
will contain the complete list of
events scheduled for the winter
quarter.

For Dorm, Commuter Delegates

General agreement on the desirability of some form of stu-
dent government prevailed in the discussion held Wednesday night
to consider the formation of an inter-dormitory council. Official
representatives of the dormitories and other interested students
attended. As a result of the two and a half hour consideration,
it was voted that representatives of the residence halls and resident
fraternity houses meet at 8:00 next Wednesday, January 31, in
the Burton East Lounge to act as'
a steering committee in making prep-
arations for the formation of some
form of student government.

Commuters to be Represented

It was announced unofficially yes-
terday that there will be a meeting
of commuters, who comprise over half
the students in the College, on Mon-
day in the Burton East Lounge at
4:00 to elect representatives to next
Wednesday’s meeting.

The purpose of the gathering, called
by the Chicago Maroon, was to clear
up confusion concerning the proposals
for student association and to define
the aims and objects of student or-
ganization.

In a prefatory statement John Yar-
nelle, Acting Director of Residence
Halls, dismissed the argument that
a dormitory council would regulate or
suggest any action on hours in third
and fourth year women’s residence
halls as a non-existent issue. Discus-
sion of hours, he said, would obscure
the purpose of the group.

Cite Needs for Student Organization
Proponents of student government
urged recognition of general student
problems, using as examples the
breach between the first and last two
years of the College, the problem of
including commuters in campus activ-
ities and other problems of living and
working together. Any solutions must
originate with the student body.

In discussing the need for student
government, Preston Roberts, head
resident of the Burton-Judson 300
entry, pointed out that since Chicago
is a young university devoting most
of its funds to research and faculty,
the residence program has been in-
adequate. A residence program and
(Continued on page six)

of the physical education department.
The period is intended to give them
a brief glimpse of campus activities
and social life—and time enough to
learn their way around, so that “I
got lost” will not be a valid excuse
for tardiness on the first day of
school.

Classes will meet on Thursday,
February 1, after which there will
be a meeting to explain the admin-
istration of the College, as it affects
the individual student. This will con-
clude the orientation program.

Activities for the incoming stu-
denfs were planned by the Orientation
Board under the direction of Mary
Augustine. Other members of the
Board are Walt Goedecke, Martha
Vaughn, Jean Gatewood, Betsy Wal-
lace, Lois Arnett Lewellyn, Bill Wub-
ben, Enid Harris, Sam MacGregor,
Charlie Schwartz, Ernie Rowe, Bab-
ette Kaplan, and Leonore Callahan.

Inter-Dormitory
Meeting Draws
Campus Views

In response .to requests by The
Chicago Maroon for their reaction to
Wednesday night’s meeting to discuss
problems of student organization, cam-
pus personalities interested in the
proposals made the following com-
ments.

Approval of the meeting was ex-
pressed by Mr. John Yarnelle, Acting
Director of Residence Halls. Mr. Yar-
nelle believes that such meetings are
the best way for students to work
out the problems on the basis of what
they want.

Preston Roberts, head resident at
Burton, declared that there is a defin-
ite need for specific organization if
problems are to be successfully solved.
“Divisions necessary” he stated “are:
(1) a dormitory council, (2) a social
organization and (3) an overall stu-
dent council.”

Opinion from the women’s dorms
also supports the need for some kind
of student organization. Emma Lou
Orth, president of the Gates Hall
council found the meeting “very en-
couraging” and is sure that student
organization is bound to come about.
A meeting is planned for Monday
night to discuss the problems but so
far, opinion at Gates is strongly in

War Bond Tea
At Ida Monday

On Thursday, February 1, President
Robert M. Hutchins will be the guest
at the first of a series of “faculty-stu-
dent teas” to be held in Ida Noyes li-
brary from 4 to 5 o’clock. Admission
to the tea, a strictly informal affair,
will be by the purchase of a twenty-
five cent war stamp. Bonds will also
be sold there.

Mrs. F. A. Ingalls, sponsor of the
committee, and Miss Marguerite E.
Kidwell, Ida Noyes Clubhouse Social
Adviser, will pour. Refreshments
will be donated by the Quadrangler
and Esoteric Clubs, and a representa-
tive from each of these clubs will act
as hostesses. The other hostesses
will include Aileen Baron and Alice
Sheehan, co-chairmen of the commit-
tee, Muriel Newman, and Virginia
Tewell.

A campaign is underway to enlarge
stamp and bond sales in order to se-
cure a Minute Man Flag. Ninety per
cent student participation is required
in order to obtain the flag. Faculty
members as well as students are
urged to attend. Students are urged
to vote for faculty members to be
guests at subsequent teas.

Plan Big W.S.S.F.
Drive in February

A goal of $25,000 has .been set for
the World Student Service Fund drive
on campus, scheduled to begin on
February 6. The urgency for student
contribution is particularly great this
year since the W.S.S.F. has with-
drawn from the National War Fund.
This was done in the belief that stu-
dent contributions would be greater
than the sum the National War Fund
allocated to them.

The W.S.S.F. is international, in-
ter-racial, non-political and non-sec-
tarian. Activities are carried on in
17 countries on 4 continents.

THE CHICAGO MAROON



Veteran’s Group Formed On Campus

Formation of a campus veterans’

group, tentatively called the Univer-
sity of Chicago Veterans’ Union, was
announced early this week by twenty-
five ex-servicemen, representing both
students and alumni. A general
meeting to select a name, adopt a
constitution, and nominate officers
has been scheduled for Wednesday,
January 31, 7:30 p.m. in Social Sci-
ence 204.

Urging all veterans to attend the
meeting, an organizing committee of
Walter Eaton, Harvey Karlen, Mor-
ton Malter, and W. R. Smith, em-
phatically emphasized the fact that
the group does not intend to split the
returning servicemen from the rest
of the campus.

“Hundreds of veterans,” they stat-
ed, “will be returning soon to the
Midway. We feel that a well estab-
lished veterans’ group can help these
boys reorientate themselves more
quickly by directing them into every
activity of the University.”

The group also plans an extensive
program aimed at bringing the war
to a successful conclusion, planning

for a better post-war world, and ac-

quainting the veteran with legisla-
tion of special interest to him.

At the present time there are ap-
proximately one hundred and fifty vet-
erans on campus, and the number is
expected to increase substantially in
the near future. Servicemen’s organ-
izations have already been formed at

Northwestern University and the
linois Institute of Technology.

Judson Open House
To Be Held Sunday

As a beginning for the social

be given in the main lounge on Sun-
day evening, from 7:00 to 12:30. The
entire campus is invited.

The party, sponsored by the Social
Committee of the two entries is pre-
liminary to a series of social events
to be presented later this quarter.

The bulk of the entertainment will
be left to the guests, but records,
cards, and facilities for playing ping-
pong, pool, and billiards will be pro-
vided.

Pertinent Problems

Mark Kennedy, former organizer

Problems” on Monday night, Jan-
uary 29th at 7:30 in Social Science
105, during the third of the series of
open meetings sponsored by the So-
cialist Club. Kennedy will take up
the particular issues of the no-strike
pledge, the impending labor draft,
and the significance of the War Labor
Board. Admission is free.

At a business meeting following
Monday’s discussion of “Peacetime
Military Conscription” the following
club members were elected to the staff
of the STUDENT SOCIALIST, pub-
lication of the Socialist Club: Ann
Morrissett, editor; Virgil Vogel, Bea
Himmelfarb, and Yosh Kawana, mem-
bers of the editorial board.

Religious Activities

“What Is Judaism?” was the subject of Rabbi Pekarsky’s
discussion last Sunday evening at Chapel Union. The Rabbi, who
is the Director of Hillel Foundation on campus, first explained the
difficulties involved in defining Judaism which is not centered, as
are Buddhism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism, on a person,
but is based on a place and a history.

“Judaism,” he said further, “is a re-
ligion of law, while Christianity is a
religion of love. Judaism believes in
salvation by acts alone.”

Hope For The Future

The action of last Wednesday’s assembly of dormitory repre-
sentatives and other interested students opens up the most en-
couraging vistas for united student action on those student prob-
lems which have plagued the campus for the past several years.
During this time, problems and their possible solutions have been
tied up in a vicious circle. There was no school spirit, there was
no means of effective communication, hence there was no possibility
of evolving any kind of student organization to cope with these
conditions. In kind, the non-existence of such an organization
made it almost impossible to deal with the lack of school spirit
or the means of inter-communication. The meeting at Burton
Court represents the first clean break out of this circle.

The students who participated last Wednesday deserve the
utmost commendation for their action in making the group
decision to work for some form of student government. This
was truly an example in the exercise of democratic principles.
An interesting sidelight which the meeting of over one hundred
students produced was the overwhelming agreement to accept
as an immediate goal a government which would include the
entire campus, rather than the more limited but easier goal of an
all-dormitory government. The purpose of the Maroon in pro-
posing a limited form of government as a necessary prior step
was that any form of government, no matter how limited or how
imperfect, could serve as the instrument for interesting the wider
reaches of the campus in means and ends of student government,
and thus make easier the task of finally establishing an all-
campus government.

At any rate, the rest of the campus must be made aware of
what was accomplished Wednesday evening. Furthermore, the
dormitory students who were at the meeting must not feel that
their job is ended. This last, especially, places a great respon-
sibility upon those students who will be elected to repreent their
dormitories at next week’s meeting. This group will, in effect,
constitute an inter-dormitory steering committee. The problems
they will have to face are by no means minor. The first task will
be the devising of some means of effective communication with
the large body of commuting students, so that these students
may have an opportunity to accept or reject the principles of
student government. They may also be called upon to assist
these same commuters in the formation of a representative com-
mittee which would participate in all future deliberations on a par
with the dormitory group. After these two labors have been
accomplished, the joint committee will then have the herculean
job aggreeing on the kind of goverment to be created, what
that government’s areas of interests and authorities shall be,
what mechanism and on what basis representatives to that
government shall be elected.

However, the size and complexity of these several matters
to be established before student government may be considered
an accomplished fact must not discourage anyone. A month ago,
there were few people on campus who would have believed that
what was accomplished Wednesday was possible. Yet, there are
inherent dangers which will face both the committee and the
very principle of government, itself. These perils can be easily
avoided, but they must not be ignored. All efforts towards our
common goal must remain united, and must not deteriorate into
a series of scattered committees or individuals who might have
mixed motives for working towards a student government. Nor
must any series of individual or limited group plans for govern-
ment mechanisms be allowed to obscure the major problems we
all face in our common endeavors. As a matter of fact, no plan
can be advanced or considered by students before there has been
sufficient assurance that the majority of students have accepted
the principles of government.

However, with the results of last week’s dormitory meeting
as a sample of what can be done by determined and enthused stu-
dents, we can look forward to our future with hope and optimism.

To the Editor: ’

At this point I am rather confused by all the verbiage that
has been bandied about the campus concerning a Student Council,
a Dormitory Council, or what have you, and I don’t think that I
am alone in my confusion!

I gather that The Maroon thinks we need an inter-dormitory
council. Being one of those creatures who lives OFF CAMPUS,
I don’t feel I should put my two cents in. This council is a matter
for the dorm girls to decide; however I do think that the problems
facing each dorm, in most cases are peculiar to that dorm, and
that any blanket rule covering all houses would just succeed in
adding to the confusion.

This is not my primary concern at
the moment. I mentioned the dormi-
tory council because this seems to be
the organization through which The
Maroon hopes to establish a Student
Council. I fail to see that the dorm
council has any basic relationship with
the Student Council, other than the
fact that girls living in the dorms
would undoubtedly be membrs of the
organizations represented in the Stu-
dent Council. Ever since I became
President of the Y.W.C.A., I have felt
a definite need for a council where
group heads could get together and
become acquainted with one another
and also with the plans of the repre-
sented organizations. If several
groups found that they were all inter-
ested in the same problem they could
pool their resources and reach a much
broader section of the campus than
ach group could hoe to reach separate-
ly. I think that discussions by the
different groups are valuable in bring-
ing out their special points of view,
but there is a definite lack of co-
ordination about our campus activi-
ties.

This problem of reaching all the
organizations on campus has become
especially vivid to me since I have
been working as Treasurer of the
WSSF Drive. To contact all the
groups and to see that they know of
the drive and if possible to gain their
support is, under the present chaotic
“system,” practically an impossibil-
ity. The Religious Emphasis Week
on campus is similarly hampered, in
its aim to have campus-wide discus-
sion on one religious question, by the
lack of organization. Certainly ev-
eryone can add to this list.

From all indications many groups
on campus are in favor of some form
of Student Council—it only remains
for some group to call the first meet-
ing of such a council. I believe that
we should have the council be more
of an advisory body in the bginning.
If we find that organization heads
can really work together the Council
could rapidly expand the area of its
activities, perhaps into the realm of
student government. I definitely think
that such a council could promote
school unity, and thus more school
spirit—of the type that Mr. Gottes-
man approves. This council could also
strengthen each organization by mak-
ing the campus realize that extra-cur-
ricular activities are important to the
total growth and develoment of each
individual; you don’t get everything
you need for living the good life out
of the Great Books. The sooner we
have a Student Council the better!

Sincerely,

Janet Davison.

To the Editor:	•

In order to let The Maroon and
its associates know our feelings
on the subject of campus organi-
zation—we submit the following:

Re: Formation of an intermediary
council.

We are opposed to it because:

1.	We fail to see that there is any ne-
cessity for such an organization.

2.	A council without power is a use-
less organism.

3.	As an advisory council it seems
destined to fail: Blake and Gates
have their own house councils and
Head Residents and in view of dif-
ficulties too great for those bodies
to care for, there is Mrs. Anthony
and Dean Kimpton. If the above
named halls cannot conduct their
affairs with the propriety and com-
mon sense expected of them, if with
the help and advice of Mrs. An-
thony, Dean Kimpton, etc., they
can do no better—how is a power-
less organization composed of oth-
er dorm members going to solve
their pressing problems? It seems
to us to be a matter strictly for
Blake and Gates. The fault lies
within them, and there it must
seek correction.

Re: Formation of a Student Council:
1. We fail to see that there is any
purpose in such organization.

2.	The virtues, propounded by The
Maroon of such undertaking seem
to be insignificant.

3.	The various organizations on cam-
pus, Interclub, I-F, Social Commit-
tee, etc. do not need further inte-
gration or organization, because in
the main, thsoe organizations are
run, managed, and followed by sub-
stantially the same people. The
students on campus who have not
joined such groups, wish to be in-
dependent. Any closer organiza-
tion of those groups would only
strengthen the grip the so-called
“Rah-Rahs” have upon campus ac-
tivities of all sorts.

4.	Those people who are engaged in
ardently pushing the proposed stu-
dent government plan seem to be
merely on the lookout for personal

THE REPUBLICAN’S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES
Midterm examination.

After diligent research into various methods of examination
we have decided that no one set of directions for this quiz would
be fair to all students of this University. We, therefore, ask the
students in the various Divisions to provide themselves with the
following:

Division of the Social Sciences.

Fourteen pounds of examination
books, three gallons of ink, and a
fountain pen.

Division of the Biological Sciences

3847 colored pencils and one sheet
of unlined paper.

Division of the Humanities.

Seven exam books and a Theasaur-
us.

Division of the Physical Sciences

A hard pencil and a sheet of squared
paper. This is for playing tit-tat-toe.
The exam will bore you.

The College

A soft pencil and a box of caffeine
pills.

The Med School.

Don’t bother with this at all. You’ve
too much work to do for tomorrow.

The Law School.

Don’t do it either. Come over to
the CHICAGO MAROON office and
argue with Hilton personally.

Question 1. Which of the three In-
dian brothers was the greatest help
to the Pilgrim Fathers, Massasoit,
Massachussetts, or Masoschism?

glory and power of one sort or an-
other.

5.	It has been said that students en-
tering the third year of the College
from high school (the majority)
are in need of an organization in
which they may find a place to make
up for the honors, etc. they left be-
hind. If these people want it and
work for it, they will gain recogni-
tion or whatever it is they are after.

6.	It has been said that those students
entering the third year from the
first and second are also lost sheep
because they have to give up their
tight cliques for the more open,
and, if we may say, dmocratic third
and fourth years. They seem to
want a Student Council so that
their former positions will not be
threatened.

7.	The reasons stated above for the
proposed scheme seem to prove that
this is one of the most high-handed
stunts ever put over on a student
body in the name of Democracy!

8.	The argument and suggestions for
dealing with commuters lack any
value in view of the fact that dorm
women have barely enough room in
the halls for themslves. Lounge
arrangements are surely not up to
those in Ida, which are not even
fully used. Those commuters who
have friends in the halls have al-
ways been welcomed in, and will be
welcome in the future. We fail to
see how any further arrangements
for their convenience can be made
outside of securing for them and
ourselves a new Union building.

It is the feeling generally held
amongst us that the formation of an
Inter-dorm Council is really only the
first step in camus organization which
would later include all groups into one
Student Council. This we say to those
who believe that a powerless Inter-
dorm Council would be worthwhile
(and give no reasons for the assump-
tion), but who are rather strongly
against any formal campus organiza-
tion. Given the one link, we believe
you will strive to go further until your
plan is completed. On this point we

Question 2. What difference does it
make?

Question 3. Were the esoteric pre-
cepts of the Know-Nothings contra-
dictory to the doctrinal credences of
the Barn-Burners? Answer briefly.

Question 4. What were the chief be-
liefs of the great southern statesman,
Cal Houn?

Question 5. Give briefly the life his-
tory of the great northern statesman,
Wilmot Proviso.

Question 6. What was so dreadful
about the Scott Decision?

Upon completion of the examination,
the student will please send it, togeth-
er with the top torn off an O.I.I. pro-
fessor or a reasonably accurate fac-
simile (a stiff military brush will do),

answers we will award a ten ride tick-

club hierarchy does not rule the roost. Last Monday, the brothers Alpha
Delt were running in and out of one room while the rest of the PX buzzed
with rumors of a little dirty work.

Entertainment of a different nature kept the evening awake—some as
pledges wandered into the PX and, for the benefit of their actives, performed
jigs and jitterbugging to the juke box tunes (they even had to beg a nickel
to feed the box). Walter, the brave Ida Noyes guard, volunteered to dance

FRENCHMAN’S
S CREEK ... is a
charming and un-
ruffled cipema
version of Daph-
ne du Maurier’s
best seller. Most
of the eyebrow-
raising situations
are merely im-
\	plied rather than

J	indicated as

£	might be expect-

ed in a picture of this type. But the
film does not stand or fall on this ac-
count; it is well-propped by several
elements: (1) appropriate casting,
(2) the expert use of technicolor, and
(3) a certain nonchalant air of who-
cares, which seems to fit very well.

Joan Fontaine gives a surprisingly
lively performance as the ennuied
toast of London. Perhaps inspired by
her red wig, she happens to things and
they happen right back. Arturo de
Cordova has perfected the character
of any pirate in any movie by adding
a touch of maturity, probably because
of his nice restraint in the use of dash
and swashbuckle, those two stock
characteristics of all buccaneers.
There is a little less of the leaping ga-
zelle about him. One might name
Senor de Cordova the first of the in-
tellectual pirates. He is called
throughout the picture “The French-
man,” “Mon Capitaine,” and “My
Darling,” so I have no idea of what
his name was supposed to be.

The story follows quite exactly that
written by the author: Dona St. Co-
lumb, bored with her aimless life, her
husband, and his friends, suddenly
snatches herself and her two children
away to her house on the coast of
Cornwall. Dona is not very disturbed
to find that a French pirate has been
sleeping in her Cornish bed in her
absence, and that his ship is at that
moment anchored in a nearby creek.

They inevitably meet and discover de-
lightfully that they are two of a kind.
The regal Lady St. Columb dons cabin
boy’s apparel and boards the ship
with Mon Capitaine for an interesting
but not very convincingly dangerous
pirating expedition in the neighbor-
hood. By the time she returns home,
Mon Capitaine has become My Dar-
ling, and once more the pirate’s need
for a name is evaded. She finally de-
cides, however, that her homing in-
stinct is too strong to break, being
the mother of two and all that, so
she gives up the Frenchman to return
to a slightly more agreeable domestic
atmosphere.

All this is quite as mild and balmy
as a cloudless sky, yet somehow this
is as it should be. The technicolor is
soft and lovely, not too brilliant; the
spirit of the century is admirably
caught; the psychology of her deci-
sion is exactly right. After all, ladies
didn’t run away with pirates, although
there was no particular tabu against
making their acquaintance for a while.
“Frenchman’s Creek” is a delightful
and attractive picture, for which rea-
sons I liked it immensely.

Maribelle Smith, and Bob DaVee.
Admission is free.

This one act selection from “To-
night at Eight-Thirty” was first per-

Sidelights on Footlights

Gogol once said, “Really there is such a lot of paper nowa-
days, that it takes time to think what to wrap up in it.” “What
shall we wrap up in,this superplussage of paper?” replied John
Anderson a century later, “Why, Gogol.” Fine, almost everybody
would agree to that, even tho’ there is a shortage.

But just the intricacies of covering
one little item, “The Inspector Gener-
al,” have confounded critics, actors,
and directors for 108 years now.
Notes on production angles are the
most controversial, dating apparent-
ly from the first performance with
which Gogol himself was dissatisfied.
Even this should be a challenge to the
O.D.P. group which will present the
satire on the Mandel Hall stage, Feb.
9 and 10, but interestingly enough,
there is more.

In 1923, Ludwig Lewisholm an-
nounced that in “The Inspector Gen-
eral,” everything is sacrificed to the
action, which is trivial, dull, and stale.
The celebrated Mr. Nathan, on the
other hand, declared that to combat
this possibility, “the play lines must
be projected like so many pies, its
very stage has to smell like booze,
its actors have to do everything ex-
cept take off their clothes and pose
in the nude.” John Anderson, who
did a profitable translation used on
Broadway in 1937, combats this by
remarking that it seems reckless to
dismiss Gogol’s people as farce types
suitable only for grotesque carica-
ture. They have in them the fine in-
tegrity of malice, a sort of cosmic
scorn which pillories them as human
beings, and the full strength of the
mockery lies in showing them for
just that.

How then, can we come to a con-
clusion as to the manner of presenting
even the penniless clerk, Hlestakov,
when critics disagree on broad out-
lines? Perhaps Gogol himself will
come to the rescue. Of Hlestakov,
posing as a St. Petersberg dandy on
vacation, he says, “He does not cheat
.. .he is not a deliberate liar.”

The program will include three
trios: Haydn’s Trio No. 5 in E Flat
Major; Schubert’s Trio No. 1 in
B Flat, Op. 99; and Ravel’s Trio in A
Minor (1915). The trio, organized last
year, comprises Erich Itor Kahn,
piano; Alexander Schneider, violin;
and Benar Heifetz, ’cello. Mr. Kahn
has concertized extensively in Europe,
and in 1938-39 toured with Pablo Cas-
als, the great ’cellist. Mr. Schneider
was second violinist of the Budapest
String Quartet from 1931 until 1943.
Last summer he appeared on campus
in a recital of Bach and Mozart so-
natas with Ralph Kirkpatrick, harp-
sichordist. Mr. Heifetz was a mem-
ber of the Kolisch String Quartet
from 1926 until 1939. He has appeared
with the Budapest String Quartet as
second ’cellist in such works as the
Schubert Quintet in C for two violins,
viola, and two ’cellos. He is at pres-
ent first ’cellist of the N.B.C. Sym-
phony. W.R.W.

“He is a young man, an official
shallow, but with many good qualities
characteristic of people whom the
world does not consider shallow. To
bring out the failings of a set of
people who are by no means devoid
of good qualities would have been a
crime on the part of the author, for it
would have exposed them to general
ridicule.”

Well, it just goes to show you. No-
body ever pays any attention to the
playwright anyhow.

Around

The Town

Between a liquid cherry and a
jordan almond with our old friend,
Otto, we got all the news about one
of Chicago’s best meals, served with
grace at MAURIICE’S, 173 West
Madison. Here, we’ve found a Smor-
gasbord—with a past, present and
FUTURE. For something like
twenty-three years, folks have been
over-eating here, and coming back
for more—and more—and MORE!
At last we’ve found the Smorgasbord
of our dreams! For $1.35, you are
welcome to a really complete dinner
from the traditional Swedish festive
board. Where else can you find caviar
and salami, both in ample portions,
at the same time?’ The hot dishes,
contained in copper urns, usually con-
sist of meat balls, pasti (spaghetti
to you) and a surprise or two. But,
personal discovery is more fun, so we
won’t spoil it for you. The Smorgas-
bord is laid only at night, but if you
can squeeze past the usual luncheon
mobs that troop in daily, you’ll find
those mid-day meals than ample.

■ THE CHICAGO MAROON —

Government...

(Continued from page one)
organization of student life cannot,
he said, be taken for granted. The
suggestions made by the Maroon form
a minimal proposal Roberts asserted.

Communication Problem Seen

Further need for a liason between
the students and administration was
expressed. In many instances during
the past year, a responsible organiza-
tion representing the student body
would have been of invaluable service.
As matters now stand there is no way
for the faculty or administration to
ascertain student opinion. Nor is
there any organized way for students
to exchange ideas with one another.
The major problem was considered one
of communication.

“We are members of a community
of scholars,” said Harold Donohue in
referring to dormitory life. “We were
put together for a common end, educa-
tion, but with no machinery to achieve
this end.”

Opponents of the principle of stu-
dent government charged that there
was no real need for a permenent
student organization. When problems
arose, they maintained, special assem-
blies could be called to work out a
solution.

Following long heated discussion
Harold Donohue offered the comprom-
ise motion calling next week’s meeting.
There is to be one representative for
every twenty-five people living in dor-
mitories of fraternity houses. Bill
Washington will preside.

promise you and your adherents a

Fortunately, this school is made up
of rather strong-minded individuals
who have taken time to think over the
idea, and who have received the ques-
tion from all sides, but still fail to find
good reason for the project you rec-
ommended.

If school spirit is so desperately
needed upon our quadrangles, we rec-
ommend the building, as soon as can
be permittd, of a Union. This could
accommodate all offices of all campus
groups, provide places to lounge and
study, a snack bar on tap at all times,
and a working juke box. Naturally,
the idea is in need of greater expan-
sion, but this is forwarded as a sug-
gestion and not a full-obdied plan. Ida
Noyes fails as a Union, but is rather
a special hangout for a “special”
group.

The Maroon, unwisely, is backing a
plan that infringes on what we feel to
be our basic individual and indpend-
ent rights,' and therefore ought to be
“told off.”

“Job Useless” Says Schreiber,
Quits Publication Position

Asserting that his position is “useless”, G. Richard Schreiber
director of the publications at the University ince September, 1943’
tendered his resignation to Dean Lawrence A. Kimpton this week.

Forum Meeting
To Discuss
Peace Problems

The second of two Student Forum
programs, designed to inform mem-
bers of the University about the eco-
nomic problems of peace, will be held
next Tuesday night, when Neil H.
Jacoby, Secretary of the University
and Professor of Finance in the
School of Business will speak on the
subject “Is Free Enterprise Doomed?”

The first of the two programs was
held this week, when Maynard C.
Krueger, speaker, suggested that the
government must take action to sus-
tain the war-time boom into the era
of peace by continued injection of
purchasing power into the economy,
through creation of a demand for
goods and by an extension of the cen-
tralized planning devices utilized dur-
ing the war. It is expected by Forum
members that Mr. Jacoby’s sugges-
tions will be an interesting contrast
to those presented by Mr. Krueger.

Jacoby is the author of several
books on taxation, as well as numer-
ous articles in business and law jour-
nals. He is a member of the research
advisory board of the Committee for
Economic Development and of the re-
search staff of the National Bureau of
Economic Research. He has had wide
experience on state and province tax-
ation and relief commissions both in
Illinois and in Canada.

The Student Forum meeting next
Tuesday evening will be at 7:30 in
Rosenwald 28, and is open to the pub-
lic without charge.

Peace Draft...

the same signs in the same part of
the Loop was held for two hours on
December 16th. The Socialist Club
is participating in another poster-
walk against peace-time military con-
scription and the labor draft and in-
vites everyone who opposes these two
measures to join in the demonstration
which will start at 4 p.m. on Satur-
day, January 30th, from Room 510,

signed copies $2.50

The resignation, it was announced,
will become effective next Monday,
February 1st. He will, however, con-
tinue in the capacity of Instructor of
English in the division, and will, in
addition, serve as editor of the mag-
azine, “Progress Guide”.

As yet Schreiber’s successor has not
yet been announced. In fact, he ex-
pressed a doubt as to the necessity of
filling his position due to the policy
of the University in which student
publications appear to be quite capable
of functioning by themselves.

In speaking of the self sufficiency
of the various campus publications,
Mr. Schreiber stated: “It has been the
University policy—and a good policy—
that student publications, like all other
extra-curricular activities, should be
self-sustaining, and should be directed
not by any one person or any group
of persons.”

In regards to the college magazine,
the “Carillon”, Mr. Schreiber said that
the magazine would continue to be
published and would not be suspended
as had previously been rumoured, but
that he felt that there could certainly
be more than one literary magazine
on campus.

His office had under its jurisdiction
the Maroon, Carillon, Student Direc-
tory, “C” book, and numerous other
lesser known student publications.

Institute Plans
To Resume Trip
Halted by War

As soon as war conditions permit
it, the Oriental Institute will continue
its Epigraphic Expedition to Luxor,
Egypt, halted in 1940 due to the war.

The expedition will be directed by
Harold H. Nelson, Field Director of
the Institute, and it is possible that
he, accompanied by several other
men, will leave for Egypt next
autumn

This work, first begun in 1924, has
as its permanent headquarters in
Luxor a large library containing 7000
volumes, dark rooms, drafting rooms,
and living quarters.

The Epigraphic Expedition does no
excavation, but devotes its entire
energies to the copying of inscrip-
tions and scenes of the previously
excavated Temples of Medinet Habu
and Karnak. Its aim is the preserva-
tion of the art and records of these
temples which are slowly being
destroyed by desert sandstorms. In
the sixteen years of work spent by
this expedition, six large volumes of
records have been preserved and sev-
eral others are still in the process of
completion.

Reactions...

(Continued from page one)
favor of the idea.

“Need for student government was
proven although no questions were
settled,” announced Jean Gatewood,
president of Green Hall. Green has
also scheduled a meeting for the pur-
pose of discussing the question.

Mary Alice Sproull, Foster presi-
dent, feels that “the main issue should
not be social activities but integration
of different levels of the College.”

Sylvia Slade of Beecher Hall, who
previously has disagreed with the idea
of student organization is “no longer
fighting the Maroon”. Miss Slade did
not have time to make a further
statemeat.

And so we close another var-
sity basketball season . . . one
word on that last game at George
Williams. If anything could
make me believe in mechanical
referees, that little debacle could.
The referees stank. Nuff said.

But the boys turned in a fine
season. DeGraw, Raby, Brok-
ken, and Sharp could have devel-
oped into an even better four-
some with time, but duty called
Ensign Brokken and Sharp soon
leaves for MM school so that
kills that.

College Heavies Lose
To Concordia Five
In End of Streak

Friday afternoon, January 17, the
U-Hi Heavy Bucketeers bowed to Con-
cordia Academy, 26 to 23, at Bartlett
gymnasium.

The Concordia team controlling the
backboards and utilizing a fast break
led all the way. Picking up in the
third quarter after a 17 to 10 dis-
advantage at the half time, the Chi-
cago boys came within one point of
Concordia’s lead, but they were unable
to overtake it, and as the final gun
sounded Concordia led by 3 points.
Valesky and Leuotke of Concordia
took scoring honors with 11, and 10
points respectively, while Schallman
led the U-Hi team with eight tallies.

Ida Noyes Bowlers
Vie for Pin Hbnors

Furthering the acceleration of ath-
letic activity at Ida Noyes Club
House, an all school bowling tourna-
ment was opened Jan. 24 in the school
alleys. The tournament will proceed
for several weeks, with the highest
man’s and women’s score taking in-
dividual prizes.

To have the score count, a slip must
be obtained from the main desk and
signatures must be recognized by the
bowling supervisor. Girls taking part
in the interfloor dormitory leagues
can use their tournament scores in
the leagues. It is suggested by Club
House administrators that bowlers
bring their own pin setters.

Win First Intramural Games

With the intermural teams going into
their second week of games, competion
is becoming really stiff. '

In the college league, the commuters
and Burton “600”, which has an aver-
age of 43 points per game, retained
their holds on the two top places by
defeating Burton “700”, and “400”
18-11, 40-8, respectively; high-scorer
for “600” was Tex Morgan, 10 points;
for the commuters, Etteison with 12.
Burton “800” took the “500” team in
their stride, 26-10.

Billings, of the Billings league, took
the Senior Medics II for a 31-11 ride,
as the Neurones beat the Spastics 19-7.
Senior Medics I outplayed the Block
Busters to a 40-20 finish, as the Navy
Frosh lost a hard game to the Fresh-
man Medics, 13-15; the Frosh Medics
dropped a decisive game 16-28 to their
upper classmates, the Soph Medics.

Competition in the University
League is very tight with four teams
tied for first place. Sigma Chi dropped
a forfeit to Psi U, 0-2; Burton 300
rolled over the Golden Maroons, 43-13;
and the Phi Gamma Delta lads walked
away from Hill’s Entry by a score
of 39-16.

Maroon Basketball Mew Close
'45 Season With ,500 Rating

Chicago closed its 1944-45 basket-
ball season in its most successful
manner since the days of 1938 with
a record of 8 wins and 8 losses. Scor-
ing 650 points to their opponents 685
the Maroons were still able to turn
in a win against the Chicago Marine
team, a double victory over Gardiner
General Hospital, a victory over Illi-
nois Tech, two wins against Wheaton,
and a victory over George Williams.

The season’s big three for Chicago,
Raby, Brokken and DeGraw finished
in that order in the scoring column
with Raby making 136 points in 16
games, and Brokken and DeGraw
scoring 123 apiece. Season averages
show Fred DeGrew putting in 9.5
points in the 13 games he played
while George Raby averaged 8.5 in
the complete 16 game schedule.

Ensign Howard Brokken, standout
at guard, scored his 123 points in 16
contests for a 7.6 game rating. The
other guard, John Sharp, holdover
from the lower college team, played
an equally outstanding season drop-
ping in 45 baskets and 6 free throws
in 16 games. It must be remembered
that in both Sharp’s and Brokken’s
cases, they palyed guard for the en-
tire year and most of their shots were
made from for out on the boor. The
possibilities of Sharp improving his
average might have been greater if
the lightining fast guard had driven
in more often but his scoring is a
highly creditable performance at any
rate.

Remembered for the most sensa-
tional shot of the season, fans are

still talking about Brokken’s
handed pivot from the tip off

one
line

in the dying minutes of the first half
in the Illinois Tech game. Fred
DeGraw runs Brokken’s close second,
although it would be hard to name
any one of DeGraw’s many sensa-
tional shots as mort outstanding.

With the aim of teaching both men
and women how to protect themselves
from physical harm in crises, Coach
Spyros Vorres has classes, at present,
in Ida Noyes Gymnasium and Bart-
lett in wrestling, judo, and jiu-jitsu.

A three week course during which
Coach Vorres presents a review of
history, rules, and fundamentals is
to be followed with inter-class com-
petition. This class, for men in the
first two years of the college, meets
daily at 3 p.m.

Edith Ballwebber reports that en-
thusiasm runs high at Ida Noyes, on
Tuesday and Thursday, when the lim-
ited class of thirty girls gathers for
each of the ten lessons in Coach
Vorres’ training course.

When the men’s course is completed
the coach plans to begin boxing prac-
tice on a class scale, but will be avail-
able for individual instruction at
Bartlett from 3:45 to 5:30 p.m. on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday dur-
ing the next three weeks.

4 Conference
Squads To Run
At Field House

Coach Ned Merriam’s varsity
track squad, still in the incuba-
tor stage, takes its first big step
next week in a quadrangular
meet on its home floor with Pur-
due, Wisconsin and Northwest-
ern. Merriam is working with a
young, green squad of 15 men,
with one numeral winner back
from last season’s squad.

Russell, Friedlander Lead

Paul Russell, high hurdler from last
season, is coming along nicely, as is
Al Friedlander in the mile distance.
Friedlander made no little name for
himself in his home state of Missis-
sippi.

Other men on the squad and their
events are John Bokman, hurdles and
880, Lawrence Fisher, hurdles, John
Horton, shot putter, Don McBride,
440, James Rust, 880, Chris Stock-
bridge, broad jump and 440, Wallace
Tourtellatte, dashes, Don Weeks, 440,
Conrad Fisher, pole vault and broad
jump and David Walston, the quarter
and the half mile.

A practice meet is scheduled with
Northwestern which will have no con-
ference significance and in which
there will be no scoring. This meet
will give Coach Merriam a measuring
stick which he can use in following
meets with such conference power-
houses as Wisconsin, Michigan, Pur-
due and other members of the Big
Ten. .



John Sharp, soon to leave the quad-
rangles, had his best night against
Wheaton as he dropped in 7 of his
favorite one handed set shots from
way out on the floor. Raby, always
a consistent player, had the crowd
on its feet more than once when it
appeared he was warding off other
players and dropping the ball in the
hoop on a tip in. His leap and turn
shot proved comparable to DeGraw’s
hesitations and Brokken’s seemingly
impossible book shots.

The ten player squad which bore
the brunt of the schedule is listed be-
low with their total games, filed goals,
free throws, fouls and averages.

Plan Table Tennis
Tournament; Teams.

Begin Play Feb. 1

A table tennis tournament which
is aimed to include every interested
player on campus has been scheduled
to start Feb. 1 at Ida Noyes Club-
house. Teams consisting of 4 players
should be entered before Jan. 30 at
Ida Noyes and a meeting of rep-
resentatives of the various teams is
scheduled in the game room at the
club house at 7:30, Jan 30.

According to plan, each four man
or woman group, which can be a
mixed team, will play other teams
and play each other individually on a
point basis. Miss Walters, physical
education instructress, is particularly
anxious that more College women en-
ter the tournament.

The complete, revised schedule, as
released this week, is as follows:

Jan. 27—Northwestern here.

Feb. 3—Purdue, Wisconsin, Northwest-

Advanced Fencers
Cross Blades Here

Sunday, January 28, has been listed
as the date of the first open fencing
meet for advanced bladesmen of this
area, it was announced this week by
Alvar Hermanson, coach of Olympic
and varsity fame.

While abnormal situations have
cut the traffic in fencing equipment
to almost zero, the U. of C. is indeed
fortunate in having enough blades
on hand to take care of both be-
ginning and advanced enthusiasts,
and most of the weapons are being
put to hard daily use as the class rolls
testify.

Hermanson also has revealed the
possibility of a dual bout with Coach
Burtt’s Ohio State team to take place
in the early spring. The varsity coach
says of this meet, “They’re good—no
two ways about it! Maroon men will
have a stiff tussle in the spring.”
Varsity and dueling set ups will be
developed in the next few weeks in
preparation for such competition as

that provided by Ohio’s team which
has enough equipment available to
stage a contest.

Friday. January 26. 1945

Store Hours, 9:45 to 5:45

willi the IWO MIMM

In the beauty spotlight this week is charming

Mary Ellen Norcross of Gates Hall . . . only recently

initiated into Chi Rho Sigma . . . and, almost as

recently, "pinned” to the president of Phi Gamma

Delta, Isn't she pretty?

Yes . . . but she’s more than that. For that head on her
shoulders is as smart as it is pretty. Already, Mary Ellen
is planning her future . . . planning to make it in fashion '
after graduation from college. And she knows what she’s
doing ... a look at her picture here, in the clothes she chose
at Marshall Field & Company, is most convincing.

The dress she’s wearing is particularly nice for college . . .
it’s casual, it’s comfortable, neither too dressy nor too
strictly tailored. In fact, it’s so campus-perfect you’ll
probably want to look at it and at the collection of
similar dresses in the Young Chicago Shop at Marshall
Field & Company. This one is rayon crepe—comes in
black, brown, fuchsia, blue, yellow or red—sizes 9 to 17.
Its price? $14.95! Sixth Floor, South, State

Meet the Best People, Every week, on this page,
the Chicago Maroon will introduce you to another
University of Chicago glamor girl ... a winning campus
personality. And every week you’ll see her in an •
attractive costume she’s chosen at

Marshall Field & Company.
