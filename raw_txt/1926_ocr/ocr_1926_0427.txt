Nine men in the third
class have been selected
bership in the Order of

year Law
for mem-
the Coif,

which may be construed as the Phi
Beta Kappa of the Law School, by
the Chicago chapter.

The honor conferred upon these
men is perhaps the most distinctive
that the University Law school offers.
It means that the nine men are the
most promising members of the first
one tenth of thep* class in both
scholarship and native ability. The
official notice credits the honor “for
high distinction in the work of the
school.”

Nine Men Named

They are: Paul Edmond Basye, A.

The committee in charge of
this year’s Track Interscholastic
requests that no fraternity or club
have a party on either June 4 or
5, when the meet is going to be
held.

This is the content of a letter
sent yesterday to the heads of
every campus fraternity and club
by Tom Mulroy, recently appoint-
ed head of the meet.

It seems that such affairs will
interfere with the plans of the
committee, which has scheduled a

vaudeville show for the
and the athletes on June
dance for June 5.

Mulroy. “If the campus interest

attention they should.

In the hope of finding more artis-
tic talent around the campus, the
Phoenix is staging yet another con-
test. This time covers are wanted.

In spite of the excellent covers
turned out this year by the staff art-
ists the Phoenix is staging this con-
test in the hope of finding a few
men to fill their ranks after several
members of the staff graduate this
June. According to J. K. Barton, as-
sistant editor, the covers will be
judged as much by originality of idea
as on excellence of technique.

The staff, despite the little help
obtained from the campus at large
this year, is sure that there is enough
wit going to waste to make several
quite satisfactory issues of the Phoe-
nix, and with this idea in mind they
are again begging the campus for
contributions. The cover contest has
been started with this hope in mind.

The editors of the Phoenix have
set the deadline for the next issue
at May 1. Handschy, the editor, is
now ill but the office hours of the
magazine are to be uninterrupted

as the rest of the staff will be
deck at the usual hours, 3 to
Handschy will probably return
school within the next two weeks.

Harry A. Bigelow, president of the

organization. “At

the annual meet-

ing of the Chicago chapter of the
Order of the Coif,” he said, “the men
were chosen. They were selected
out of the first ten per cent of the
present third year class, consisting
of graduates or candidates for grad-
uates or candidates fur graduation
fr<tm the Law school between Oct.
1925 and September 1926, for high
distinction in the work of the school.”

Select Law Review Editors

Nine students have also been ap-
pointed to represent the University
Law school in the editing of the Illi-
nois Law Review, a journal of Law*
published jointly by the University
of Chicago, the University of Illi-
nois, and Northwestern university.

Plan Many Surprises

A number of surprises in the pro-1
gram have been decided upon since |
the play was selected. Chief among
these will be a specialty written by
Frank Breckenridge, Abbot of Black-
friars when James Weber Linn’s
“The Naughty Nineties,” was pro-
duced. Mr. Breckenridge’s work is
the dramatization of “Rhapsody in
Blue,” a phonograph record by Paul
Whiteman, in which the characters
are suggested by the music. Espe-
cially designed scenery and costumes
will be used to carry out the author’s

All manly and over-bearing seniors
will soon be at it again. Friday at
noon, every male senior will meet
at the C Bench and be inspected be-
fore the annual mustache race. The
race is limited to two weeks at the
end of which time "Doc” Bratfish,
contest judge for the last twelve
years, will pick the winners. Last
year the race was called off after the
first week owing to the death of
President Burton.

Bets are as low as two to one on
some of the prominent seniors, and
it is quite apparent that competition
will be fierce hot hfor first prize and
for the booby prize.

Paul Cullom, who is conducting
the contest for the class, is planning
the unique feature of requiring a re-
port every noon from each con-
testant, containing the number and
length of any possible hairs entered.
The standing will be posted daily in

The Whistle Is at Last Given
the Air; Will Broadcast in May

The Whistle in the past has reach-
ed its public in many different ways.
It has been read over people’s shoul-
ders in the classrooms, it has been
borrowed in Harper library, accom-
modating freshmen have read ex-
cerpts from it at the dinner table,
and some have even purchased the
Daily Maroon. ^Now comes the an-
nouncement from Terrible Turk that
the Whistle will be broadcasted over
the radio.

The Whistle club represented by
Turk (Leo Stone), Mimi (Marie Gal-
pern), Sis (Helen Wilner), Atlas
(William Solenberger), and GeoG,
(George Gruskin) are going to broad
cast a skit “Writing the Whistle,”
through station WLS, from Mitchell
Tower as soon as Jon Van Zant, Uni-
versity director of radio, can find an

available night in the early part of
the month of May. The skit, placed
in the Maroon office, will introduce
.the column conductor, surrounded
by his contributors, in the process of
getting out his daily column. Hu-
morous verses and comments that
have been popular in past editions
will be featured again.

Ken Ward, who contributes to the
Whistle, has promised his jazz or-
chestra for the occasion, and will
accompany some of the campus tal-
ent in singing the Whistle poems
which have been set to music.

“The Whistle Club skit,” explain-
ed Terrible Turk, “will not in any
way resemble R. H. L.’s Line Nites.
We have been working on some-

thing that is entertaining and

NEW CHAIRMAN
OF FEDERATION

RESIGNS POST

Dorothy Kennedy Gives Up I
Work; Hannah Johnson >
Takes Office I

Dorothy Kennedy has resigned
from the chairmanship of Federation
on account of ill health. She will be
succeeded by Hannah Johnson.

Miss Kennedy was elected during
the winter quarter and has served as
chairman of the Council since that
time. When asked to give her reas-
ons for her resignation Miss Kennedy
said, “I have considered my resigna-
tion from the chairmanship of the
Federation of University Women the 1
wisest course under the circum-i
stances, and the one which will be*
best both for Federation and for me.
Owing to my ill health during the
last two quarters, I lack the energy to
carry my academic work and Fed-
eration as they both deserve, and
have of course chosen to give up
Federation.”

Hannah Johnson, chosen by the
Federation council to fill the posi-
tion left vacant by Miss Kennedy’s
resignation, was formerly treasurer!
of the Y. W. C. A., but has given
up this office to accept the chairman-
ship of Federation.

Catherine Boettcher, a member of

| the Federation council, has also re-
dignted. Mfes Boettcher’s Reasons
for resigning are as follows, “I can
no longer give the time to Federa-
tion that it deserves, as my study is
requiring more time this year and
wiF continue to do so.”

Virginia Gartside, a Federation
sponsor, and a junior, has been elect-
ed to take the place of Miss Boet-
tcher.

a few7 luxurious days in the peace

fronted with quite a problem. The
problem is, to be exact, what excuse

QUADRANGLES GIVE
APPROVAL TO
BALL

Success was the prime feature of
the Military Ball — success not only
manifested in a good time of all the
guests, but also in a financial way.

Novel lighting
orations, and
throughout the
make this ball

arrangements, dec-
uniforms scattered
crowd combined to
all that the leaders

hoped that it would be.

The lights were devised and exe-
cuted by Gerald Bench, a student at
the University. Four flood lights
occupied the corners of the room,
producing lovely color effects and
dimming at appropriate times. The
orchestra disappointed no one, in-
asmuch as they kept up the standard
of Balloon-Room fame. Participants
in the grand march passed under an
arch of drawn swords and flowers
held up by the leaders and their part-
ners.

and an orchestra to entertain them
the Seniors ought to have a merry
time—according to those who are in-
terested in the celebration.

Through Allan Irwin, president of
the Glee Club, a quartet from that
organization has been obtained for
the evening. They will sing all the
seniors’ favorite songs and keep the
party going in many other ways.

Announce Tickets

The price of all this very good
entertainment is but seventy-five
cents, payable at the gate or through
one of the two persons in charge of
the entertainment or any of their
numerous lieutenants. There are to
be no speeches whatever, which ac-
cording to Mulroy, is reason enough
for attending any dinner, no mat-
ter how big or how dull.

Lots of very good food, plenty of
excellent vaudeville, the University
Band, Al Irwin’s quartet from the
Glee Club, Bill Hahn’s College Crew,
a special act by Mr. Hamilton Cole-
man, the man who, single handed
puts on the Blackfriars show year af-

campus, and last, no speeches. Such
is the progrm arranged for this ex-

BREASTED AND THE BIBLE: A LETTER

To the editor:

1 have before me the Daily Maroon for Thursday, April 22,
and notice the heading "‘Biblical Tales Proven Fruits of Imagina-
tion. Concerning this let me say a few things.

I. The geography of your article is somewhat dislocated.
You say that one object of “This expedition to the Nile Valley” is
to complete the diggings at Armageddon.” Armageddon is not
in the Nile Valley but in north central Palestine.

2. The title under which your article is printed is not at
all borne out by what you quote from Professor Breasted. All he
says is that in the ancient inscriptions deciphered in Egypt there is

nothing to bear out the Biblical stories. Even a person who has
not studied logic can see that this does not prove “that they are
fruits of imagination."

3. It is well known that such Biblical stories as are found in
the early chapters of Genesis are ancient Hebrew versions of world
stories found among many, if not most, of the primitive peoples.
What basis in actual occurrence they might have had it is quite im-
possible after this lapse of time to say, but it does not follow that
they had no basis, and one thing is very conspicuous—that as told
in the Bible they are given a moral content and were used for re-
ligious instruction in the time when they were thus shaped. To head
the article as you did is not only quite misleading but betrays ignor-
ance of what these things mean. It is like the reckless headings con-
cerning religious and Biblical items which are found so often in the
daily press. 1 was here when the Daily Maroon began its career years
ago, and I remember distinctly that President Harper at the time
expressed great satisfaction in the prospect that now we should have
a daily paper which would handle University matters intelligently
and be a relief from the reckless forms of statements found in the
daily press. In this case the Maroon has simply followed the very
objectionable form which it was hoped that we might escape.

Yours sincerely,

F. J. Gurney,

Assistant Recorder.

world-order.” The institutes under
the foundation are held during the

of 1925 dealt with problems of the

pected to prove most popular is the
Glee Club, which will appear for the
first time in a Blackfriar show. The
Blackfriar jazz orchestra is broad-
casting the new music from various
radio stations this week.

INVITE 6000 PREP SCHOOLS TO MEET

Craske Hurls Phi Delt Ballmen to Victory Over Alpha Epsilon Pi

ONLY GAME OF

DAY IS SPEEDY;

POSTPONE TWO

Psi Upsilon Forfeits to
Zeta Beta Tau in
Other Tilt

Only one of the four games sched-
uled was played in the Intramural
Playground Tournament yesterday
afternoon. This game was between
Phi Delta Theta and Alpha Epsilon
Pi, the former winning by a 13 to 6
count. Psi Upsilon forfeited to Zeta
Beta Tau, and the remaining two
games were postponed.

Although the Phi Delt-Alpha Ep-
silon Pi contest was not close after
the third inning, when the Phi Delts
forged into the lead with four runs,
it was hard fought all the way
through and both teams played as if
it meant a World Series Title. The
score by innings was as follows:
Phi Delts .1.. 1 2 4 4 0 0 2—13
Alpha Ep. Pi. . 3 0 0 0 0 3 0—6

Contrast In Pitching

There was a decided contrast in
the style of pitching used by the op-
posing moundmen. Craske, Phi Delt,
put the ball over the plate in a slow
but sure way and let the batters hit
it if they could. His deceptive “slow
ball” fooled many of them, however,
and he registered more fan-outs than
did the opposing pitcher, Handler,
who put over a speedy ball in the at-
tempt to scare out the opposing bat-
ters. The Phi Delts were not to be
scared however, but waited out these
attempts time after time to get
walk after walk. Diamond replaced
Handler in the sixth inning, and suc-
ceeded in holding the winners to two
runs. Johnson and Weiss completed
the Phi Delt and Alpha Ep batteries
respectively.

In the very first inning, the Phi
Delts, first up to bat, got the bases
full with only one out against them,
mainly through the walks given them
by Handler. Craske brought in the
first score of the game, but the other
men died on base, the Alpha Ep
hurler bracing up to fan out two in
a row. When the Alpha Eps came to
hat they started out with three clean
hits before an out was registered
against them, and succeeded in
counting three runs to take the lead.

Handler Tighten* Up

Handler repeated his walking
game in the second inning and had
the bases full and no outs. He again
tightened up and held the Phi Delts
to two runs, by putting some con-
rol into his fast throws. Although
the Alpha Eps continued to hit
Craske’s throws in the second inning,
they could not get to first on them,
and were put down in one-two-three
order. This put the score at three
all.

Tennis Squad Plays

In Elimination Meet

Prospects are looking brighter for
a strong tennis team this year, now
that the warm weather has shown
that last year’s men have greatly im-
proved. Capt. Wallie Scheffer show-
ed a powerful forehand drive while
all the other candidates are concen-
trating on a fast serve. An elimina-
tion tournament is now in process to
weed out the poorer candidates.

Some of the more promising can-
didates expected to come through
are Shapinsky, last year’s frosh star,
Hudlin, Cohn, Hall, Bennett, Fran-
cis, Plaut, and Drain. George Lott is
not expected to be eligible in time to
participate in the Big Ten matches.

Close Entries for
Non-Greek Meet

Entries close today for non*
fraternity tennis championship as-
pirants. Last year there were two
hundred and twenty entries in the
Intra-mural tennis tournament,
butthis year the entry blanks have
been slow to come in.

Play in both the singles and
doubles meets begins this Wednes-
day afternoon at the courts at
Kimbark Avenue across the Mid-
way. These courts are reputed to
be in wonderful condition for play
making the contests fair to all, ac-
cording to Gordon Wallace, man-
ager of the tourney.

The meet is used to uncover
new material for the freshman
squad and many future stars get
a taste of tournament play for the
first time in this annual meet.
Last year’s winner of the Singles
meet, Shapinsky, is now out for
the varsity team.

WHAT o/ IT?

^CEORjie MOI\GEN»T8^

The printer having dusted off the
headpiece to this column and things
having been generally put into shape
for my return, I stroll once more in-
to the white space which, until some
four weeks ago,' was devoted ex-
clusively to the airing of my person-
al views on whatever for the mo-
ment caught my fancy. This is all,
of course, my way of saying that
I am come back to the Maroon
again, matter of moment or not, as
you care to look at it. My protract-
ed absence, unlike your probable
belief, was not caused through any
ruction with the guiding minds in
charge of the Maroon. Only yester-
day, indeed, I ate an olive-nut sand-
wich with M. Allen Heald, of whom
you may have heard as being one of
those connected with the paper, in
the Coffee Shop. True, M. Heald
and I went separate ways after we
had done munching, but that was not
caused by any feeling of inimicabil-
ity, but rather because M. Heald had
done the unorthodox by telling me
what not even one friend is supposed
to discuss with another, and I, I re-
gret to say, had done the same by
him. These Coffee Shop olives, I
might say enpaszant (I must main-
tain the Gallic flavor which you may
have noticed already in this article),
are very mature indeed. But that is
beside the point, as almost every-
thing I have said so far has been
Anyway I am back, and I may not
as well devote further time to shout-
ing the joyous news from the house-
tops.

In the course of four weeks of in-
tensive drilling on “The Meaning
and Value of the Arts” under Messrs.
Sargent, Taft, Rothschild, et al, I
have been greatly enlightened. I
have, for one thing, taken great de-
light in applying Mr. Sargent’s def-
inition, “Art is not a thing; it is a
way of looking at things,” to what
has gone on about me in the class-
room. I have been greatly inter-
ested in observing the way some of
my fellows have “looked at things”
thrown upon the screen used by the
gentlemen in, lecturing. “If art,”
I reasoned, “is a way of looking at
things, then surely there must be a
type attitude, mental or otherwise,
that is art.” I have done a good
deal of research on this point, but
I have not as yet been able to de-
termine just what this type attitude
is. Perhaps the one represented by

BURG BACK FROM
EASY VICTORY IN

PENN HIGH JUMP

Defeats Anson, Buck High
Jumper; Avenges Ohio

Defeat

Although the Maroon tracksters
at Drake were very modest in re-
gard to gathering points, the track
team which represented the Midway
at the Penn relays was not at all
backward. Anton Burg, the Maroon
team at Pennsylvania Saturday,
slung off his sweat-shirt, leaped,
and leaped again until he mounted
over the barrier at 6 feet 3 inches
to win the high jump in the East's
biggest relay meet. Burg, the one
man team, came in on the rattler
last night none the worse for his
cross country jaunt.

Burg Gets Revenge

Besides winning the event Burg
got a huge thrill out of defeating
Anson, Ohio State athlete who beat |
Burg in the Ohio Relays. Anson ;
was tied with McGinnis of Wiscon-
sin for second Saturday with a jump
of 6 feet 2 1-8 inches, so Burg was
forced tq show his pluck in every
sense of the word to leap 7-8’s of
an inch higher to win the jumping.
Anson had won the Ohio meet with
a jump of 6 feet 3 inches to Burg’s
6 feet 2.

Always Wins

Winning the high jump has been ।
a habit with Burg this winter and ;
spring. He was an easy victor in
the dual meets with Purdue and :
Indiana, and at the Conference In-
door meet he scaled the pole at 61
feet 2 inches to cop first. The only I
man to leap higher than he in the |
same meet was Anson at Ohio, hut I
Burg got his revenge Saturday

MAROON TRACKMEN
FAIL TO COP POINTS

AT DRAKE RELAYS

“When Burg’s away the team
can’t make hay” explains the poor
showing of the Maroons at the Drake
relays Saturday. Although the squad
was in suits and shivered and ran, I
all was in vain for the Midway run-
ners received nary a point for all
their trouble. Anyhow the exerc'se |
was good.

The Maroons did not have to wor- i
ry about upholding the honor of the I
state for Illinois saw to that. The I
Illinois squad had a great time at I
the relays for they took six firsts and |
a respectable number of seconds,
thirds and fourths.

The breaking of the world’s rec-
ord in the 100 yard dash by Roland
Locke, University of Nebraska
sprinter, was the feature of the day.
He ran it in 9 and 5-10’s seconds,
which seems remarkable considering
the soggy condition of the track, but
Locke was aided by a strong gale,
which blew directly on his back.
Charley Hoff, the famous Norwegian,
broke the American record in the
pole vault with 13 feet, 9 1-4 inches.

Intra-mural Land

Madison, April 26.—The addi-
tion of a plot of land ten acres in
size bordering on the land of the
new University dormitories, will
give to the University of Wiscon-
sin one of the finest intramural
Athletic fields in the country.

The land will be fixed over into
base ball diamonds for the spring
part of the program and will
serve a greater purpose for foot-
ball in the fall.

The extension of such a program
on the neighborhood of Camp
Randall will tend to center the en-
tire Badger athletic program away
from the lower campus. With the
dormitories on the verge of com-
pletion, it means the growth of a
new center for Cardinal athletics
and an extension that should car-
ry them out of the business dis-
trict of the city.

BATMEN LOOK TO
FIRST HOME TILT

Drill for Badger Contest
Saturday After Iowa

Postponement

Rained out in their attempted start
against Iowa, the Maroon diamond
warriors are keying up for the in-
vasion of Wisconsin here on Satur-
day. This will be the first home
game for Chicago an dthe players are
are eager to make impressive show-
ing before the local followers of the
national pastime.

Have Beaten Purple

The Badgers come here boasting
one of the strongest teams they have
turned out in years, with a victory
over Northwestern to their credit.
Coach Lowman has a great pitcher in
Stoll, who set the Purple down six
hits. The Cardinals have had the
benefit of a southern trip, and
should the weather be such that the
Maroons will be unable to get plenty
of practice during the current week,
the visitors are conceded an edge.

The Maroons have as yet not hit
their hitting or pitching stride. Like
last year’s team they are a warm
weather team and should finish
strong in the Big Ten race as they
did last year. Gubbins and Marks are
both hot weather pitchers, who should
rank with the best in the Conference
as soon as the frigid atmosphere de-
parts.

INTER-SCHOLASTIC HEADS TO OFFER
THREE NEW RELAYS FOR COMPETING
HIGH SCHOL TRACK ENTHUSIASTS

To Be Run in Two Sections, Academy and High School,
As per Usual; to be Held in Conjunction With
First Annual Chicago Prep R. O. T. C. Revue

By Bob Stern

Six thousand invitations to the
University’s Twenty-Second Nation-
al Inerscholastic Track and Field
championships will soon be winging
their way to the prep schools of all
of North America, and soon the thou-
sands of actual acceptances and en-
tries will be crowding the return I
mails. Yesterday the first of the;
heap of letters to the coaches of the
nation were sent out and within a I
week the replies will come pouring;
in as the athletic heads of the prep j
institutions strive to get their en-।
tries in under the time wire so that
their men may compete in the great
annual track classic on June 4th and
5th.

The meet is open to any of the
high schools and academies of the
forty-eight states, Canada and Mex-
ico. The plans for this year are most
elaborate. The expectations of the
meet officials are mounting high, for
the student organizaion that is the
backbone of the business section
seems to be at the top peak of ef-
ficiency. Tom Mulroy, who led last
year’s affair to success, has again
been appointed chairman of the In-
terscholastic Committee by Coach
Stagg and he has again brought to-
gether a student staff of experience
and ability.

Athletes Have Wonderful Chances

For the first time in its history the
meet will be held this year at the
new Grant Park Stadium, in that
enormous space every athlete who
competes will have the best chance
of his career, for in addition to hav-
ing the boon of the wonderful run-
ning track and field to perform on
the old handicaps of crowding and
milling because of restricted space
will be eliminated. Thus every man
will compete under the fairest of
fair chances.

As is usual the meet will be di-
vided into two sections, one for the
high school championship and one
for the academy championship. Sev-
enteen events will comprise the high
school program while the schedule
for the academies will include thir-
teen. There will be a complete set
of prizes for each section and all

of them will be beautiful emblems
for the victors in the various contests
to cherish. Over two-hundred med-
als will be awarded to the individual
place winners for there are to be
five medals for each event.

Entertainment To Be Lavish

Several innovations are on the
I card for this year. Probably the
most Important of these are the
three new relays for the high school
section. These additions are a half
mile with each man running 220
yards, a one mile in which four men
run a quarter each, and a two mile,
each man running a half mile. These
relays are to take the place of the
old three-quarters medley event.

Housing and entertainment prepa-
rations for the visiting athletes* will
be of the most elegant this year.
The teams will all be guests of the
University and will be housed at the
fraternities during their stay. Ban-
quets, shows and trips will make
up the entertainment. And in con-
junction with the meet the First An-
nual Review of the R. O. T. C. Unit
of the City High Schools will be
held.

40,000 Spectators Expected

It is expected that a crowd of
40,000 people will witness the games.
Last year the crowd overflowed the
I field to watch the boys from 194
j schools of thirty-one states and Can-
; ada compete. This year the acr
