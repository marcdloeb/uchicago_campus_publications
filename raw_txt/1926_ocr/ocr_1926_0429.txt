BENNETT HEADS CAMPUS CABINET

THIRTY-FOURTH
ANNUAL SENIOR

DINNER TONIGHT

Jubilee and Anniversary
Get-Together Combined

This Evening

At 6 o’clock this evening the class
of ’26 gathers in the Circle for the
thirty-fourth senior dinner, one of ;
the most traditional classic occasions
in the annals of campus history.

Tonight’s festivities mark not
only the anniversary of the class din-
ner, but also the second annual class
jubilee, last year’s juniors having
originated the event. With the best
features of both combined, the se-
niors expect to have a big time in
the School of Education dining room
this evening.

Explain Dinner At Chapel

Eleanor Rice, co-chairman of the ।
affair, will speak at noon in senior;
chapel, explaining the features of the
affair. Afterwards a few remaining
tickets will be sold. There will be no j
opportunity to purchase tickets at the
door.

The seniors will meet at six in the ,
Circle and proceed to the scene of
the dinner via fraternity houses and
campus landmarks. A thirty piece j
band will accompany the group. Din-1
ner will be followed by five vaude-
ville acts, after which the senior
mustache race will get its impetus
and official organization by Doc Brat-
fish.

Shop* Make Donation*

Among numerous donations to the
dinner are 100 roses from Oberg's
Flower Shop and an immense birth-
day cake from Holmes’ bakery. The
dinner itself, according to the co-
chairmen, will surpass any meal ever
served at a campus affair.

Bill Hahn’s College Crew will fur-
nish syncopation throughout the eve-
ning. Hamilton Coleman, producer
of Blackfriars, is scheduled for the
feature act of the jubilee, while Sew
Covert and Chuck Anderson will en-
tertain their Ifellow-classmen with
an original skit. Orvis Henkle, who

Spring Fever Hits
Pete’s Candy Wagon

Pete and his candy wagon—
permanent fixtures of the curbing
out in front of Bartlett gym—
nearly met with a sad accident
yesterday. It seems that Mor-
vich, Pete’s trusted steed, got
weary of his unromantic stand
and decided to take a rest. He
sagged at his knees and dropped
in a tired heap between the
shafts of the pop corn wagon.

From within Pete heard the
commotion and felt his outfit shiv-
ver from top to stern, like a migh-
ty dreadnought about to sink.
Jumping up he saw Morvy lying
there in the dust of University
Avenue like a tired housewife.
Their eyes met. All sorts of
slanderous accusations concern-
ing the character, quality and
past life of the faithful horse be-
gan to flow from his master’s but-
tered lips. But some kindly stu-
dents assisted Pete in assisting
Morvich to his feet and off they
drove, Pete muttering words.
And words.

Install Weather Observatory
On Rosenwald Hall

Weather forecasts made from the
Observatory located on Rosenwald
hall have been accepted as official
since the station located at the Uni-
versity was made one of the branches
of the U. S. weather bureau.

The local observatory is known to
be one of the three best equipped
stations in the country, the other two
being Blue Hill observatory located
at Harvard University and the Cen-
tral Office of the weather bureau at
Washington, D. C.

“The reason that the shelter rec-
ords are now taken at the University
instead of at the downtown office,’’
said Mr. E. P. Johnson, metoroligist
and an official connected with the U.

S. weather bureau, “is that the ex-
posure is better in this vicinity than
in the loop where the high buildings
cut down the wind record. The wind

record taken at Rosenwald observa-
tory is thus more reliable.’’

The observatory at the University
is under the auspices of the down-
town office in the Federal building,

in the evening.

Prof. Douglas ’ Haitian Discoveries
Feature Next Literary Supplement

Discoveries in Haiti that have been
made recently by Prof. Paul H. Doug-
las of the University, will be the sub-
ject of an article that is one of the
features of the Literary Supplement
of The Daily Maroon that will come
out next week. Prof. Douglas was
sent there a short time ago to see how
the United States controls tat coun-
try. He has spent some time study-
ing wherein the control of the United
States has worked to the best advan-
tage of that country and in what lines
of activity it has not.

Another feature will be a poem
written by Prof. Edward Sapir of the
department of Anthropology. Al-
though an anthropologist, Prof. Sapir
has made a reputation as a poet. His
most recent poem was written for the
Supplement and will appear next
week.

The next issue will begin a series
of articles revealing the feelings of
men who have retired from important
offices in the University. The first of
these will be written from an inter-
view’ with Dean Wilkins, who has re-
cently given up the position of Dean
of the Colleges of Arts, Literature,
and Science. This article will be fol-
lowed up in ensuing issues by stories
of the same kind. Different men who
have retired from prominent positions
will be interviewed similarly. The
second installment of “Memoirs of a
Chorus Lady” will also be contained
in this issue.

Besides this material, contributions
are asked from students of the Uni-
versity who wish to write. Articles
dealing with criticisms on any phase
of college life, or ones primarily of
a scientific point of view, will be very
acceptable.

An investigation which will at-

the problems of personality from the
side of body chemistry. It is under

A DINNER FOR ’26

f^ REAT benefactors, leaders of humanity, always deserve praise,
whether they already have it or not. They deserve it espe-
cially, if they have not yet had it—if they belong to that great, dim
army of the unrecognized. To these unknown soldiers, according-
ly, we give all possible applause.

This seeking out of unthanked heroes, and thanking them, has
been our practice for a long time. When Fireman Felix Van Auken
hears the alarm and wakes all his companions, we give all praise
to Van Auken—even though he does not himself go to the fire, and
so misses all of the hurrah’s and hozannah’s that his fellows get. (Has
he not done his share in waking the gang? We once tried to wake
our roommate.) When Joe Bilgewater, expert plumber, lays the
pipes for Prof. Michelson’s great experiment, we laud Bilgewater
along with Michelson. When some absent-minded companion an-
swers “Here’ to our name in a nine o'clock class, we thank him—
even though we awake at 9:10 to find the thing a dream.

First on our docket for today's hall of fame are the engineers
of tonight's Senior Dinner and Jubilee. We must offer, in accord with
our policy, some notice of their too-little-noticed achievements. We
must note the blessings of a banquet without speeches. We must give
credit for an entertainment in which Covert shall declaim something
other than The Bolo Bird. We must take into account the innova-
tion of a banquet with good food. The world, we fear, overlooks
these services. It will profit by them, of course; banquets without
speeches, banquets without The Bolo Bird, and banquets with good
food will now, in the course of time, become the style. The human
race will be happier. But the human race will not know to whom it
owes this debt.

The promoters of tonight's doings. Miss Rice and Mr. Mulroy,
did not stumble upon success by accident. Their acheivement is no
matter of luck. It results from years of preparation. Mulroy, for
example, is no novice at this matter of dinners (though he may,
through various technicalities, retain his amateur standing.) He has
arranged dinners, given dinners, officiated at dinners, and held din-
ners, all his life. The dinners he has manipulated since his entrance to
the University, if served one after another (and supplemented with
malted milk and other nourishing adjuncts) would keep a fairly
healthy man alive for a considerable period. Mulroy may not be
what one calls a diner-out; but he has enough dinners of his own.

To the jubilee committee of the class of 1926, therefore, we of-
fer the thanks that the rest of the world has withheld. We salute
them. We admire them in silence. In fact, we may express our grat-
itude in still another way. We may attend the banquet.

his class to enjoy the last rqedexvous
of pleasure before he assumes the
title of “graduate.”

Much has been said about the plans
for this evening’s festivities, and the
participant becomes very anxious for
the arrival of the hour of six when
the class will meet at the Circle.
From there, with the leadership of
the University band, the students will
parade to the grill in the School of
Education. There, the guests will
dine and be entertained by Hamilton
Coleman, coach for Blackfriars. Also
among the talented entertainers will
be the members of the Glee club quar-
te, and the members of Bill Hahn’s
“College Crew” orchestra.

On Friday evening the Glee club is
again entertaining at the Reynolds
club where, following a concert given
by the organization, a dance will be
given by the club from ten to twelve
in the Reynolds theatre.

The Reynolds club, in fact, finds it-
self involved in many of this Sphere’s
activities this week-end, for Saturday
night the Psychology department is
giving a dance there. Mrs. Thurstone
is hostess for the department.

At Ida Noyes hall on the same eve-
ning, the Lutheran club is having its
annual Spring party.

Two house dances complete the cal-1
endar’s entries this week; Phi Delta,'
where Mr. and Mrs. B. G. Leeck, Mr.
and Mrs. R. H. Little are to be guests
of honor; and Pi Lambda Phi house
dance where Mr. and Mrs. Milton
Barancik are honored.

that can come but once.
And as a Senior you've
reached your place at the
top of the world—have a
Camel!

For Camel shares of
its own enchantment with
life’s memorable events.
Camels are of such choice
tobaccos that they never
tire the taste or leave a
cigaretty after-taste. Re-
gardless of the money
you pay, there is no
mellower, friendlier or
better cigarette made
than Camel.

So this day as you’ve
safely passed all the
hazards to life’s sublimest
moment—know the taste,
the contentment that is
the due of the world’s
experienced smokers.

Have a Camel!

Camel quality, is that
you try them. We in-

No other cigarette in the world is like Camels. Camels con-

blend is the triumph of expert blenders. Even the Camel
cigarette paper is the finest — made especially in France. Into
this one brand of cigarettes is concentrated the experience
and skill of the largest tobacco organization in the world.

Chicago has the edge on Indiana
in the meet at the Hoosiers’ school.
Campus and outside sport dopesters
have come to that important pre-
meet conclusion after a week of
strenuous result comparing and com-
parative time compilations. And it

seems that they have
right decision in spite
that in the last indoor
meeting at Evanston

star Anton Burg will lead the Ma-
roon athletes to the fray. Burg, so
the dopesters say. is of course going
to be a sure winner in the high jump,
for he won the event at both the
quadrangular meet with Indiana,
Northwestern and Michigan and at



Saturday a Big Day
For Big Ten Nines

Saturday will be a busy day for
Big Ten Baseball teams. Four
games are scheduled; Wisconsin
here, Minnesota at Iowa, Ohio
State at Illinois, and Northwest-
ern at Indiana.

The present season promises to
be almost as hectic as the past
basketball season judging from in-
dications. None of the teams are
outstanding. As yet Minnesota
has- a clean slate, winning their
only game from Northwestern.
Chicago dropped two, one to Pur-
due and another to Northwestern.
Michigan got off to a good start
until they were bumped off by
Ohio State Monday. The contests
this Saturday will probably bring
further upsets, making this sea-
son more like the basket season.

Petchukitus was on the grill. “How
do you expect to ever get any-
where?” he was asked by Crouch-
Trumbull, “when almost every night
you are out at one of these cabarets?
Really, obi fellah, you know you are
about the only thing that keeps the

the competition a bit stiff in the half
mile end mile events, which are his
favorites. W. S. Kaine of the
Hoosier team managed to beat Jim-
my out of a second place in their*
event at the conference but he had
to exert himself to do it. Now the
local Captain is out for blood and :
he swears that he will beat Kaine by
a mile in both of the events. Thus
more Chicago points should pile up.

But Pepper of the Indiana boys is
said to be a whiz in the sprints.

In fact he was good enough to take ।
a second to Locke in his record— |
breaking 100 yard dash at the Drake
Relays. His reputation in the 2201 (
