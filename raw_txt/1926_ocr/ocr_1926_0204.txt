It is possible that man is at ti e end
of his physical evolution ami that other
generalized plastic forms of life are
awaiting their opportunity to take his
place, according to a new version of a

book, “Evolution, Genetics,

is soon to be published by the Uni-

the defense of John T. Scopes at Day-

Explaining what evolution is and
what it is not, in view of the attacks
made upon it, Prof. Newman points
out that man developed much earlier
than present day apes and monkeys
and could not possibly have descended
from them. Darwin never held the no-

Each year this student confab takes
place at some .American school, and
Tulane university of Louisiana has
been selected host for the coming con-

from George T. Walne, chairman ot
the entertainment committee of the
southern school invites a representative
of Chicago to be his guest from the

PROMINENT MEN

By Robert Harman

Those who attend the thirty-second
annual Washington Prom on Feb. 19,
at the South Shore Country club will
dance to the “red hot” music of Husk
O’Hare’s Casino Club cnpem;ble, it
was announced yesterday by Paul Cul-
lom, Prom leader. The band is well
known on campus inasmuch as it is
the one that played for Settlement
Night this year. It was secured
through the combined efforts of the
Prom leaders and “Husk’’ O’Hare, who
seems to enjoy the patronage of the
University as much as they enjoy him.

In order that there might be con-
tinuous music throughout the evening,
the Prom leaders are considering hav-
ing two orchestras. This innovation,
they think, will greatly add to the suc-
cess and enjoyment of the Prom.

This was the decision made at the

the proposal to admit a reporter to fu-

of nine to two. The objections to the
motion were (1) that a reporter might

\ /TOST of the dullness in the world comes from an effort at clever-
ness. The fellow who tries to entertain us (unless he can)
is our greatest bore. The overworked bon mot is the emptiest plati-
tude. Slang is the most insipid dialect, because slang tries to be
colorful.

We do not object to plainness. We like a fact simply stated.
We like the story-teller who attends to his story, and forgets the
tricks of style. Homer used his adornments; but he had a story
that would have stood alone. Conversation, we believe, ought to
follow the same narrow path. “How's tricks?” or “How’s every
little old thing? ’ is a poor substitute for “How are you?” Even
in their prime,-the expressions “Applesauce” and ‘‘So's your old
man” scarcely had the force of the simpler form, “Go to the devil.”

Of course, you may have, some day, a truly happy thought. You
may conceive something new to say, something genuinely clever.
Don t suppress it. Make it known, but be discreet. Your best plan,
perhaps, is (1) to make sure of the real worth of your mot, (2) to
select, very carefully, small friendly audience, (3) to find a good
excuse for springing your discovery, (4) to spring it, somewhat
bashfully, and (5) to change the subject immediately.

Of this process, the first item is probably the most important.
Followed, it will halt the rise of many a flat poke; it will keep many
a stale expression out of your mouth.

We do not think that scholarship stands for everything. We be-
lieve that there are other things at college that are worth while. With
the existing system at most higher institutions of learning, however,
there seems to be no other way of appraising one’s worth as a stu-
dent than by A s, B’s, etc. Grades in themselves we consider unde-
pendable. If a University could do without such a grading system
it would be better, for grades are inaccurate, are unfair, and many
times do not indicate the truth worth of a student.

With all these faults, however, we must tolerate the system and
do the best we can. We are attending the University and we must
do as the University does.

Those who succeed in pulling down good grades we think should
be commended. They deserve credit and should receive praise from
the University and the campus.

Former Victory Makes Ma-
roons Favorite in Coming

Clash

Contrary to current beliefs the Ma-
roon basketball forces will be able to
present their full strength at Columbus,
Ohio, when they meet the quintet rep-
resenting the Buckeye institution of
learning next Saturday night. Jack
McDonough who was thought to be
seriously injured in the Butler fracas is
quite certain of starting the confer-
ence game, jt was announced at the
gymnasium yesterday.

McDonough Back On Team

McDonough has to be helped from
the floor during the first half of the
Indianapolis meeting after spraining
his ankle twice in succession, and to
rest it up he is not engaging actively in
the practice sessions this week. As a
result the Maroons stand a chance of
repeating their first win over the Stat-
ers, although the latter earn is favored.

Cunningham Big Threat

Ohio State will undoubtedly profit
by their early licking by devising some
method of confusing Norgren’s man
for man defense, and enabling Cun-
ningham to get in position to shoot.
The big fellow’s scoring attempts were
completely smothered in the first meet-
ing. Norgren is still stressing shooting
ami free-throwing tactics in the hopes
that his men will acquire theses quite
valuable traits.

HOLD INITIATION IN
TARPON TOMORROW

who have successfully passed their first

Tarpon club will initiate all those
tests at noon on Friday, Feb. 5. in
the Ida Noyes swimming pool. The
initiation will be followed by a tea and
an open business meeting at 4 in the
Ida Noyes refectory. Attendance at
both these affairs is required of old
members, as well as initiates because
important business will DC discussed.
The cost is thirty cents for old and
eighty cents for new members. At the
noon meeting the initiates will be pre-
sented with black felt tadpoles which
entrance tests and belong to the lowest
signify that they have passed the
rank of Tarpptrites. They will also he
required to give stunts under the
charge of Ruth Moore.

Those who are to become members
on Friday are Emorettc Dawson. Ruth
Egdorf. Harriet George. Sylvia Greve,
and Ruth Rosborough. It is probable,
however, that there will be more names
added to this list after today, when a
number of women will trv to pass the
tests.

WHAT of IT?

^/GEOI^E MORGENSTERN

Our estimable contemptorary (and
no pun intended, as the boys say).
Terrible Turk, but yesterday came
out in The Whistle with a statement
that was as irreverent as it was child-
ish. “By the time that our university
building program is completed, we
will have five separate chapels. Qh,
Lord! Our rushing arguments will
readily assimilate the phrase—“Yeh,
and w’e’ve got chapels from coast to
coast.” Such stuff, methink, smacks
of heresy.

I would not, however, object to ic
solely on that ground; it is the mis-
placed levity of the thing that wounds
me. Instead of treating such a rush-
ing argument with the gravity it
rightly deserves, here Turk is, figura-
tively speaking, thumbing his nose
at it and running off with a whoop.
I feel it my hounden duty to condemn
him in strongest terms—to tell him
that he is all wrong and all wet and
(antiquated word!) a crackpot in the
bargain.

Some weeks ago I devoted my col-
umn for two straight days to the
business of pointing out that despite
all the opportunities offered by our

numerous interscholastic competi-
tions, it seemed beyond the powers
of even the smoothest of our col-
legians to lure any considerable num-
ber of gifted high schot 1 athletes into
our fair school. One of the explana-
tions I offered at the time for this
lamentable failing on the part of our
well-tailored, double-gripping rushing
committee was lack of arguments that
would really convince the boys that
old Chicago was the greatest school
on earth. Now, when a really good

GYM TEAM FOR

ILLINOIS COMBAT

Maroons Have Defeated Illini
Squad for Past
Fifteen Years

Buoyant with the remembrances of
fifteen years of successive victories,
the Maroon gymnastic team will meet
the Illini squad at Bartlett gym and
attempt to chalk up another win to
their list. The Illinois team, however,
is a dark horse in the conference race
this year and according to the latest
reports from their camp may stage a
surprise. The rival team has a strong
parallel bars and ring outfit which
may cause the Chicago team some
trouble.

Men In Good Shape

Although the Maroon squad is com-
paratively green this year, the men
have been training hard and will be
in tip-top shape for the meet.

“All the men on the squad are hard
workers” said Coach Hoffer, “and if
they do as well as they did in the
Milwaukee meet they should have lit-
tle difficulty in trimming the Illini.”

Quinn Stars In Clubs

Tn Captain Jerry Quinn, Hoffer has
one of the best club men in the Big
Ten. He took second place in the con-
fevnce last year in this event and is
qually versatile in the horizontal bar,
horse and tumbling.

rushing argument comes to light, it is
laughed to scorn.

It is entirely out of place, in my
belief, that upon the rushers bringing
up for the benefit of the high school
boys the argument ”... and just look
at our chapels,” the loud ha-ha should
ring1 through the tinted South Side
air. For in the past, the good old
religious appeal has been at least as
potent as anything else in making the
high school hoys see the merits of the
old school. I could point out the case
of one of our football captains of re-
cent years, who delights in attending
chapel “localise the choir music’s so
good.” I could go on and call to mind
that one of the most gifted runners
(he was a tenor, too) who was ever
enticed into school came all the wav
from farthest God’s Country so that
he could get all the advantages of
voice training in the university’s fa-
mous chapel choir.

I could point out all these instances
and many more, and I could demand
of Terrible Turk, “Where is there

Battle in Meet With Hawkeyes

IN I-M SCHEDULE

While the splashing squad is train-
ing hard for the next meet at Iowa,
Coach MacGillivray is pondering over
the possibilities of beating the Hawks
on their own water grounds. “I’m
perfectly satisfied with the work of
the team this year and I am convinced
that the men have a good chance of
annexing another victory next Satur-
day night when they meet the strong
Iowa. However it will be no easy
job for the Hawkeyes boast of sev-
eral veteran stars of last year and
Chicago will have to show some real
talent in order to overcome the more
experienced out-state team.

“The defeat at the hands of the
Michigan crew does not show that our
team is weak for swimming was not
the only factor concerned in the loss
of that meet. Chicago has an ex-
ceptionally hard schedule to battle
against, in fact the hardest it will
have for some years to come but the
dual meet will furnish the men with
the much needed experience for the
Conference finals.

“In Captain Ed. Noyes the team

has a >”an who is mighty hard to beat
in/' 'ater and who has a good
chance »^ Conference placing. P.
Petrolowitz, Captain of the Water
Polo crew ha. the inborn ability of a
leader and is a dangerous man to
cross in a game. Among the new men
Fellinger and Wilder are both classed
as leaders in the fancy diving classic
and who within the next few years
will be in all probability be the stead-
iest point gainers for the swim
squad.”

cause for levity here? Has not the
chapel had a long and honorable his-
tory in the annals of university rush-
ing’ Where, T’d like to know, do you
get that way?” I could do this, I
say, and indeed I do. I repeat that
Turk’s statement is founded on ignor-
ance; that, in fact, it is purely a mis-
representation and a fallacy. And I

go still further—I say that the whole
tone of his Whistle reference to
chapel shows a lamentable backslid-
ing from that sound Baptist upbring-
ing which I am sure he got in his
earlier (and I regret to say) better
days.

Entries for I-M Handball
Tourney to Close
Tomorrow

Fraternities who wish to enter
teams in the handball tournament
will have until tomorrow night to
hand in their team according to
an announcement made by Gordon
Stillman, Intramural manager of
this event. This sport has always
been popular among the men of
the University and more teams
than last year are expected to com-
pete.

The courts which will be used
are located in the stadium and are
available for use on Mondays from
2 to 3:45 and from Tuesday to
Friday from 4:15 to 6:00 p. m.
On Saturday they can be used
from 9 to 12 a. m. ami any eve-
ning until 10 p. m.

PLAY INTERDORM

GAMES TONIGHT

The second series of interdormitory
games will be played off at 7 tonight
in Ida Noyes hall when Green will
meet Greenwood and Kelly will play
Drexel. Green and Kelly are the
leaders so far in the tournament, each
having won one game, and of the two
losers, Greenwood is perhaps the
stronger, although Drexel may pull a
surprise tonight.

These interhall games have been
characterized this year by a scientific
atmosphere which was totally lacking
in former years. Credit for this new
spirit is due in part to the women,
who have practiced faithfully and hard,
and in part to Miss Alma Wylie.

in Tourney

With the present spring weather
in process the Intramural Ice Carni-
val heads were forced to postpone the
big winter event which was to have
begun today until some obscure time
early next week when Old Man
Weather will relent and chip in with
some of the genuine cold commonly
associated with plain skateable ice.
Robert Engberg and Fred Widman,
who are directing the carnival, ex-
pressed hopes that the first heats
could be conducted Monday.

130 Men Entered

The individual entry list is an im-
posing one, featuring 135 names. It
is expected that a great bit of the
honors will be won by Fellinger, Brig-
nail, Nardin, Curtin and Oker who
have had some experience in the long-
blade speeding before. Bud Wood is
reported to he somewhat dexterous
on the curved runners and the figures
he will cut will play a prominent part
in the judging of the winner of the
fancy skating event.

• See Us About Our Special Inducement for Student Parties

’ll /TOST of the dullness in the world comes from an effort at clever-
ness. The fellow who tries to entertain us (unless he can)

is our greatest bore. The overworked bon mot is the emptiest plati-
tude. Slang is the most insipid dialect, because slang tries to be
colorful.

We do not object to plainness. We like a fact simply stated.
We like the story-teller who attends to his story, and forgets the
tricks of style. Homer used his adornments; but he had a story
that would have stood alone. Conversation, we believe, ought to
follow the same narrow path. "How’s tricks?" or "How’s every
little old thing? ’ is a poor substitute for “How are you?" Even
in their prime,-the expressions “Applesauce" and ‘‘So's your old
man” scarcely had the force of the simpler form, “Go to the devil."

Of course, you may have, some day, a truly happy thought. You
may conceive something new to say, something genuinely clever.
Don’t suppress it. Make it known, but be discreet. Your best plan,
perhaps, is ( 1 ) to make sure of the real worth of your mot, (2) to
select, very carefully, small friendly audience, (3) to find a good
excuse for springing your discovery, (4) to spring it, somewhat
bashfully, and (5) to change the subject immediately.

Of this process, the first item is probably the most important.
Followed, it will halt the rise of many a flat poke; it will keep many
a stale expression out of your mouth.

The most successful artist is his own critic.

“just fine and dandy" for us to publish the names of all those who
received Phi Beta Kappa grades last quarter. He jeeringly advises
that gold stars be pasted in the course books of those who got three
A's, silver stars for two A’s, etc.

We do not think that scholarship stands for everything. We be-
lieve that there are other things at college that are worth while. With
the existing system at most higher institutions of learning, however,
there seems to be no other way of appraising one’s worth as a stu-
dent than by A s, B’s, etc. Grades in themselves we consider unde-
pendable. If a University could do without such a grading system
it would be better, for grades are inaccurate, are unfair, and many
times do not indicate the truth worth of a student.

With all these faults, however, we must tolerate the system and
do the best we can. We are attending the University and we must
do as the University does.

Those who succeed in pulling down good grades we think should
be commended. They deserve credit and should receive praise from
the University and the campus.

no pun intended, as the boys say).
Terrible Turk, but yesterday came
out in The Whistle with a statement
that was as irreverent as it was child-
ish. “By the time that our university

building program is completed, we
will have five separate chapels. Qh,
Lord! Our rushing arguments will
readily assimilate the phrase—“Yeh,
and we’ve got chapels from coast to
coast.” Such stuff, methink, smacks
of heresy.

I would not, however, object to it
solely on that ground; it is the mis-
placed levity of the thing that wounds
me. Instead of treating such a rush-
ing argument with the gravity it
rightly deserves, here Turk is, figura-
tively speaking, thumbing his nose
at it and running off with a whoop.
I feel it my bounden duty to condemn
him in strongest terms—to tell him
that he is all wrong and all wet and
(antiquated word!) a crackpot in the
bargain.

Some weeks ago I devoted my col-
umn for two straight days to the
business of pointing out that despite
all the opportunities offered by our
numerous interscholastic competi-
tions, it seemed beyond the powers
of even the smoothest of our col-
legians to lure any considerable num-
ber of gifted high schot 1 athletes into
our fair school. One of the explana-
tions I offered at the time for this
lamentable failing on the part of our
well-tailored, double-gripping rushing
committee was lack of arguments that
would really convince the boys that
old Chicago was the greatest school
on earth. Now, when a really good

GYM TEAM FOR

ILLINOIS COMBAT

Maroons Have Defeated Illini
Squad for Past
Fifteen Years

Buoyant with the remembrances of
j fifteen years of successive victories,
the Maroon gymnastic team will meet
I the Illini squad at Bartlett gym and
! attempt to chalk up another win to
their list. The Illinois team, however,
is a dark horse in the conference race
this year and according to the latest
reports from their camp may stage a
surprise. The rival team has a strong
parallel bars and ring outfit which
may cause the Chicago team some
trouble.

Men In Good Shape

J Although the Maroon squad is com-
I paratively green this year, the men
! have been training hard and will be
in tip-top shape for the meet.

“All the men on the squad are hard
workers” said Coach Hoffer, “and if
they do as well as they did in the
Milwaukee meet they should have lit-
tle difficulty in trimming the Illini.”

Quinn Stars In Clubs

Tn Captain Jerry Quinn, Hoffer has
one of the best club men in the Big
Ten. He took second place in the con-
ference last year in this event and is
qually versatile in the horizontal bar,
horse and tumbling.

rushing argument comes to light, it is
laughed to scorn.	t . '

It is entirely out of place, in my
belief, that upon the rushers bringing
up for the benefit of the high school
boys the argument ”... and just look
at our chapels,” the loud ha-ha should
ring through the tinted South Side
air. For in the past, the good old
religious appeal has been at least as
potent as anything else in making the
high school boys see the merits of the
old school. I could point out the case
of one of our football captains of re-
cent years, who delights in attending
chapel “because the choir music’s so
good.” I could go on and call to mind
that one of the most gifted runners
(he was a tenor, too) who was ever
enticed into school came all the wav
from farthest God’s Country so that
he could get all the advantages of
voice training in the university’s fa-
mous chapel choir.

I could point out all these instances
and many more, and I could demand
of Terrible Turk, “Where is there

Maroon Natators Face Tough

Battle in Meet With Hawkeyes

While the splashing squad is train-
ing hard for the next meet at Iowa,
Coach MacGillivray is pondering over
the possibilities of beating the Hawks
on their own water grounds. “I’m
perfectly satisfied with the work of
the team this year and I am convinced
that the men have a good chance of
annexing another victory next Satur-
day night when they meet the strong
Iowa. However it will be no easy
job for the Hawkeyes boast of sev-
eral veteran stars of last year and
Chicago will have to show some real
talent in order to overcome the more
experienced out-state team.

“The defeat at the hands of the
Michigan crew does not show that our
team is weak for swimming was not
the only factor concerned in the loss
of that meet. Chicago has an ex-
ceptionally hard schedule to battle
against, in fact the hardest it will
have for some years to come but the
dual meet will furnish the men with
the much needed experience for the
Conference finals.

“In Captain Ed. Noyes the team
has a man who is mighty hard to beat
in the water and who has a good
chance for Conference placing. P.
Petrolowitz, Captain of the Water
Polo crew has the inborn ability of a
leader and is a dangerous man to
cross in a game. Among the new men
Fellinger and Wilder are both classed
as leaders in the fancy diving classic
and who within the next few years
will be in all probability be the stead-
iest point gainers for the swim
squad.”

cause for levity here? Has not The
chapel had a long and honorable his-
tory in the annals of university rush-
ing? Where, I’d like to know, do you
get that way?” I could do this, I
say, and indeed I do. I repeat that
Turk’s statement is founded on ignor-
ance; that, in fact, it is purely a mis-
representation and a fallacy. And I
go still further—I say that the whole
tone of his Whistle reference to
chapel shows a lamentable backslid-
ing from that sound Baptist upbring-
ing which I am sure he got in his
earlier (and I regret to say) better
days.

Entries for I-M Handball
Tourney to Close
Tomorrow

Fraternities who wish to enter
teams in the handball tournament
will have until tomorrow night to
hand in their team according to
an announcement made by Gordon
Stillman, Intramural manager of
this event. This sport has always
been popular among the men of
the University and more teams
than last year are expected to com-
pete.

The courts which will be used
are located in the stadium and are
available for use on Mondays from
2 to 3:45 and from Tuesday to
Friday from 4:15 to 6:00 p. m.
On Saturday they can be used
from 9 to 12 a. m. and any eve-
ning until 10 p. m.

PLAY INTERDORM

GAMES TONIGHT

The second series of interdormitory I
games will be played off at 7 tonight
in Ida Noyes hall when Green will
meet Greenwood and Kelly will play
Drexel. Green and Kelly are the
leaders so far in the tournament, each
having won one game, and of the two
losers, Greenwood is perhaps the
stronger, although Drexel may pull a
surprise tonight.

These interhall games have been
characterized this year by a scientific
atmosphere which was totally lacking
in former years. Credit for this new
spirit is due in part to the women,
who have practiced faithfully and hard,
and in part to Miss Alma Wylie.

IN I-MSCHEDULE

Over One Hundred and
Thirty Men Entered
in Tourney

With the present spring weather
in process the Intramural Ice Carni-
val heads were forced to postpone the
big winter event which was to have
begun today until some obscure time
early next week when Old Man
Weather will relent and chip in with
some of the genuine cold commonly
associated with plain skateable ice.
Robert Engherg and Fred Widman,
who are directing the carnival, ex-
pressed hopes that the first heats
could be conducted Monday.

130 Men Entered

The individual entry list is an im-
posing one, featuring 135 names. It
is expected that a great bit of the
honors will be won by Fellinger, Brig-
nail, Nardin, Curtin and Oker who
have had some experience in the long-
blade speeding before. Bud Wood is
reported to be somewhat dexterous
on the curved runners and the figures
he will cut will play a prominent part
in the judging of the winner of the
fancy skating event.	.
