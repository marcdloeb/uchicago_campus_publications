ALL MANUSCRIPTS FOR
FIRST ANNUAL FANTASY

Simple advice on how to become a
gentleman over night was being pub-
lished by Chesterfield, true gentleman
of the Eighteenth century, many years
before the vogue of etiquette books, it
is learned front Dr. V’. B. Heltzel’s
graduate thesis at the University on
'‘Chesterfield and the Tradition of the
Ideal Gentleman.”

According to Dr. Heltzel. Chester-
field said that if a man was virtuous,
honorable, a good dancer, a moderate
drinker; if he arose early in the morn-
ing to study, if he avoided hasty friend-
ships and bad company, if he could
handle a collegiate “line" and if he
never gambled he could be a gentle-
man whether he was born a prince or
a pauper. Chesterfield discounted the
value of birth as a characteristic of an
ideal gentleman because he called it a
gift of fortune.

World Wisdom Essential

Rook learning and knowledge of the
world were held to be highly essentia
to the equipment of the gentleman. Dr.
Heltzel asserts.

Adhering to the old Renaissance tra-
dition that every hour of unnecessary
sleep made life so much shorter, Ches-
terfield admonished the gentleman to
get up eatly in the morning and use
the time for study. Dancing, he said,
was as much an exercise as fencing and
should be practiced for its healthful ’
stimulation as well as for the ease and)
grace of deportment it produced.

Decries Drunkenness

Tn an age when the ale-house was
an integral part of every community,
Chesterfield decried drunkenness. Dr.
Heltzel shows. The investigator con-
tinues, “In his uncompromising atti-
tude toward drunkenness Chesterfield
has quite naturally the support of the
entire tradition. Among writers pf the ■
Renaissance, excessive drinking is stig-
matized as one of the most degrading
vices a gentleman can practice. From
the early seventeenth century, how-
ever, there is a growing tendency to
sanction the desirability of a glass or
two for social purposes. By the time
Chesterfield began writing, in spite of
some opposition from those who
preached abstinence, it was a well es-
Ublished tradition that in company a
gentleman might drink in moderation

of the Hobscheid party are failing be-

which came in late Friday evening to
introduce a new factor in the Maroon

Aside from this unheralded advance
of the darling Deke duo, the contest
is working out along conservative lines.
Walter Williamson, with a remarkable
nobility of character has withdrawn
from the contest since, as the official

condition. "He is doing very well,”
he said, “and resting very easily.”

The

Harkins Doubts
Mercury Tests
Are Conclusive

“Although the present beliefs of
chemistry discount the transmutation
of the elements, the process has never
been proved impossible. However,
we can understand the transforma-
tion of lead into mercury only after
it has been successfully repeated.”

This opinion was voiced today by
Dr. William Draper Harkins of the
chemistry department of the Univer-
sity, in reference to the claim of Drs
A. Smits and A. Karssen of the .Uni-
versity of Amsterdam in which the
European scientists declare that they
have succeeded in transforming lead
to mercury.

“The methods taken by these men
seem to be thorough and carefully
executed, but their experiments are
open to question,” declares the chem-
ist. “In the first place they make no
mention of investing the helium nuc-
leus with one Alpha particle, or strip-
ping it of two electrons. This would
have to be done to transform the lead
into mercury, and chemistry has thus
far been unable to do it.” ^_r

Th’« “tent” work consists of human

significant attitudes. While the tech-
nique is essentially that of ancient
Egyptian art, these pieces are mod-

done now by the lower classes in
Egypt.

Tea will be served every day this

To win in favor of women, Chester-

tentions and flattery, Dr. Heltzel goes
on to show. He thought, moreover,
that women have but two passions,
vanity and love, which are “their uni-
versal characteristics . . . and in gen-
eral. all they say and all they do tends
to the gratification of their vanity
or. their lover.

“Civility,” he continued, “is partic-
ularly due to all women; and remem-
ber, that no provocation whatsoever
can justify any man in not being civil
to every woman; and the greatest man
in England would justly be reckoned
a brute, if he were not civil to th*,
meanest woman. It is due their sex,
and is the only protection they have
against the superior strength of ours.”

Right Man

FROM ACROSS THE LAKE

COACH Fielding H. Yost has written, as one of a series of articles
called “My Thirty Years in Football,” appearing in The New
York World, a chapter on “Alonzo Stagg—The Grand Old Man.
His view is not over-influenced, as are the views of many critics, by
the accidents of a season or of a college generation; his thirty years
as Mr. Stagg’s colleague give him a clearer sight. His words, there-
fore, must have great weight in an appraisal of Mr. Stagg s worth.
We quote parts of his article:

I hold that Alonzo Stagg is one of the finest products of Ameri-
can athletic and college life of all time.

— - I have known “The Old Man” for many, many years, and have
come to know him well. To know him is to love him, and I yield to
not even Chicago men in my affection for him. Like Walter Camp,
he has served football gloriously; additionally, he has contributed
enormously to the advanced technique of the game. With Harry
Williams, another old Yale man who £Iso took up coaching, he wrote
the first football book I ever read.

I consider men like Camp in the East and Stagg in the West
the real leaders in the development and growth of intercollegiate
football. Stagg, like Camp, has always been clean and fine and has
realized how the true purpose of the game co-ordinated with the
true purpose of the university.

MONKEYWRENCHES

A PERIOD in an artificial but thoroughly realistic hell must al-
ways precede admission to the hallowed ranks of a fratern-
ity, it seems.

A few days ago we were detained at the Maroon office until
about seven o clock, and one of our number chanced to be a fresh-
man on the point of being initiated into a fraternity. The simple
youth had been told by his upper-classmen to report at six o’clock,
but thinking that work on the Maroon was a legitimate excuse he
lingered no, being sure that one of the higher-ups in the office had
called up his house and explained everything.

The hgiher-up did call up the house, and his explanation was
considered satisfactory,—that is, until the freshman arrived. Then
the wrath of those mightier than he descended on him.

Now this, we think, was unjust. The period of probation may
have a point to it, but it should never be allowed to interfere with a
freshman’s ordinary work, whether in the classroom or in activities.

The fraternity is a useful institution, but in cases such as these
it becomes a hindrance rather than an aid. Fortunately these cases
are rather rare. They ought to disappear altogether.

THE SECOND POST

To the Editor:

The Daily Maroon Beauty Contest somehow entered into the
religious discussion which was supposed to occupy the Romans
at their last meeting. An interchange of views on immortality
was interrupted by a reference to the Campus Daily’s unpop-

members, a resolution condemning the Maroon was passed,

Maroon swimmers rested yesterday j

for their next meet with Iowa, at Iowa
City on February 6. Most of the men
are in fairly bad condition, especially
those who played on the water polo

Maroons Defeated

Mac GiUivray’s crew was
accent a left handed defeat,
at the Wolverine pond. A

slightly stronger team, a longer pool,
warm water and a long trip were fac-
tors connected with the result of the
meet.

Ed. Fellingcr was the only Maroon
entry who was able to capture a first
place. Fellingcr won the diving easily
for a non standard pool has nothing
much to do wk\jhe art of fancy form
forming. Wilder, his teammate, an-
nexed a third in the same event.

Noyes Unable to Win Firsts

Captain Ed. Noyes did excellent
work in all of his events hut was un-
able to repeat his former times and had
to finish third in both the 50 yard
sprint and the 100 yard crawl. Duc
to the length of the tank the confer- j
cnee distance of forty yards was
changed to fifty in order to allow for
the difference against the wishes of the
Maroon mentor.

Captain Gow. and Darnell were the
high point men for the Wolverine
splashers both men being in excellent
form. Morrie Shore, former U. of C.
star, took first place away from Dia-
mond, doing 2:52 for the two hundred
hreastroke event. Karl Mygdal, Ma-1
, roon mainstay in the hreastroke, did
not take the trip due to injuries receiv-
ed a few days before the meet.

Water Polo Squad Loses

The Water Polo teamwise* held the
wrong end of the rope, being subdued
by the Michigan team by a 4’ to 2
• count. The water polo artists claim
• this game to be the roughest they had
ever taken part in. since the referee
had evidently forgotten what his whis-
tle was to be used for. They expect
a return meet however, at the I. A. C.
and plan to even up the score with the
help of an efficient referee.

Beta Bowlers Beat
x Alpha Delts Easily

The tenpins toppled merrily but rather
scarcely in the Reynolds Club bowling
alleys yesterday afternoon. For only
two games were scheduled in the inter-
fraternity league and of these one was
forfeited. Those who were present
however did everything within the
range of their powers to make up in
quality what was lacking in quantity.

The first match scheduled was can-
celled when the Phi Beta Delta’s for-
feited to the Delta Upsilons. In the
other contest the Beta team skinned
the Alpha Delt pill rollers by winning
the first two games of the three round
decision match. The third game was |
played merely as a matter of form so
that the full scores could be telegraph-
ed to Ohio State to he entered in the
national championships.

Gene Francis turned out to be the
high man of the affair with a count of
174 to his credit in one game and Wil-
son took honors for the composite to-
tals with scores of 161 and 164.

all events except the half mile and
1,200 yard relay, the Alumni agsUn
! won the the annual triangular con-
test which brings together the form-
er, the present, and the future Ma-
roon track men in pre-season com-
petition. Scoring 47% points, the
“old boys” made exceptionally good
times to finish 11 points ahead of the
i varsity and way in advance of the
। yearlings.

Uncover New Material

Relative scores were of little signi-
ficance to the real purpose of this
meet however, as its primary motive
was to uncover new men among the
varsity and freshman ranks and dis-
close the weak spots in their team?.

From their showing in this me^t.
the varsity appears strongest in the
880, won by Capt. Cusack, and the
| relay, won by Armstrong, Beale,
Weddel, Landsworth. Second places

It is a singular peculiarity of the

sporting public that it is ready to
accept anything it sees in print on a
sport page as the gospel truth, and
the writers- of such chronicles as no
less than seers whose lightest word is
to be put down as obediently, as the

in the low' hurdles, high hurdles,
quarter-mile, shot put, and ties for
first place in the high jump and pole

in these events.

morning gruel. In such a way even ■
such pseudo-authorities as Mr. Fred ■
Hayner of the estimable Daily News |
and Mr. Walter Eckersall of the up-
right Tribune have come to be held
as prophets by followers of sports
doings in town and country. In a
similar fashion, but to a much less
marked degree, even I have become
something of a sage in the field of
athletic opinion in this local unit,
commonly referred to as “the Mid-
way.” I do not attempt to explain
such a phenomenom; I merely assert
that it is a fact.

When, therefore, I broke out in
print some days back to the effect
that Nels Norgren’s Maroon basket-
ball team had very little, if any,
chance against Mr. “Barney Google”
Meanwell’s “pivot and trailer” (I
quote) game, the opinion was accept-
ed rather generally. The same day
that idea of what ought to happen
at Madison came out in the Maroon,
I encountered Mr. Norgren over in
the gymnasium. In fatherly fashion
he pointed out the errors of my ar
tide.

“In the first place,” said he, “Wis-
consin is not using the old pivot and
trailer system this year. Meanwell
has a bunch of long shots, and he
doesn’t try to work the ball in as
close as he used to, so consequently
he has thrown the old Wisconsin
style of many years standing into the
discard. 'The men just take the ball
down the floor any way that seems
handy, and then they cut from one
fide of the floor to the other some-
thing like Iowa when they get with-
in scoring range, shooting from near
the sidelines. It is the first year that
Meanwell has ever adapted his system

The sport has always been a cen-

and a meeting with a member of the
Big Ten gives it an added attraction.
Conseouently the athletic authorities
have been notified to prepare for an
invading body numbering around a
thousand. The orchestra and singers
should give zest to the event.

The Maroon first team will vie with
the array of old stars representing
the Hawthorne A. C. while the sec-
ofid team will meet a picked group
from the various Y. M. C. A.’s of the
city. Among the ranks of the
H. A. C. team are Vorhees, Satai, and
Stepskal, all Central A. U. cham-

Clean Cut Win Over Illinois Heartens Norgren’s Men to
Attempt Similar Achievements During Present
Week of Play

Northwestern defeated Iowa.
37 to 21, in a game featured by
Fischer’s basket making and
Purple close guarding. Baker
was held scoreless by the Hawks.

With the Gophers scheduled for
midweek and Ohio State. last year’s
big ten champs, due to appear on Sat-
urday, the Maroons lace a busy and a
very important week in the hectic con-
ference cage race. With the season
well under way and with one team
boasting a clean slate the Maroons
have an even chance of finishing
among the first three in the scramble,
providing of course, that they down
the strong Buckeyes.

commendable and is deserving of men-
tion. The Illini were able to get very
few shots under their own basket, and
only three long shots by Captain
Haines, who was sent in with instruc-
tions to shoot them long after it was

evident that they could not
Norgren’s defense, allowed them
any semblance of a score

The squad will hoard the rattler
Minneapolis tonight and should
feat the northerners, who have

for
de-
not

been faring any too well this season.
However, Minnesota has several good
men, especially Racey. who are cap-
able of upsetting the dope bucket with-
out warning, and the Maroons may be
in for a hot time.

Featured by the* close guarding of
the Chicago five, the Maroons sprang/
another upset Saturday and defeated
Illinois. While the play was not of
the best the work of the Chicane J
guards, McDonough and Hoerger, was I

well evened up as each sank five fields
goals. However the Maroons caged
the majority of their freethrows which
eave them the margin of victory.

Norgren started Sackett and Zjm-
merman at forwards, McDonough and
Hoerger at guards and Alyea at center.
This combination proved very effec-
tive. although a real scoring man is
lacking. If a second Spradling or Min-
er could be unearthed somewhere
around the Midway, the team would
become a real threat because any ag-
gregation that can hold such teams as
Purdue and Illinois to 20 points sure-
ly has something.

Illini Overrated

The Illini failed to live up to ad-
vance prediction. Kassel’s close guard-
ing and the shooting of Haines were
the outstanding features.

DISCUSSION ON THE
CURRENT QUESTION

WHAT OF IT?

Why should a maiden meditate

Upon the looks of men

And pro and con their virtues state,

Their points of beauty rush to rate,
when

As everyone knows

It’s the cut of his clothes

And his drag ’em down hose

Not the shape of his nose
That count.

It’s the kind that he smokes
And the shade of his okes
Not his pulchritude votes
That count.

It’s the dear daddy’s gin
And his nice friendly grin
Not his Woodbury skin
That count!

PROF. FRANK O’HARA, deep in
a discussion of this Beauty Contest
business at the Senior dinner last Fri-
day, is accused of having insinuated
to our good friend, the editor of the
Phoenix, the startling news that he,
Fred, was the “Handschy-est Man on
Campus!”

OVER at the Northwestern, we are
told, the science department in some
sort of test induced a student to eat
sixteen plates of Sauer-kraut. Our con-
fidant does not mention the Teward
that the martyr was given but implies,
however, that he did get a B. A.

obvious that he must be a bear for
pupishment.

merely, as we started out to see the

BAND GIVES FIRST
BENEFIT PROGRAM

Members of the University band will
offer their first benefit program for the
Settlement “back of the yards” Thurs-
day, Tan. 27, from 7:30 to 8:30 at the
University Settlement house, 4630
Gross street.

The concerts of the Band are a year-
ly institution and .will be given once
each month throughout the winter
quarter.

“These concerts are offered in an
endeavor to stimulate the musical edu-
cation and aesthetic appreciation of the
people, in this district,” said Mack
Evans, musical director of the Univer-
sity faculty. Complete and appropriate
programs have been arranged.

“You also said,” continued Mr.
Norgren, “that Brooks, the Badger
captain, is the regular center. The
fact is, that Brooks is one of those
bench captains. He is only used for
a few minutes each game, Barnum
doing the .jumping and then going
i back to guard. That leaves Behr,
) Hothckiss and Andrews as three for-
wards to do the basket popping. Pow-
ers and Nelson are somewhat of re-
gulars, too—just as much as Capt.
Brooks. Meanwell’s system is a lot
more flexible than it used to be, and
। for that reason it will be a good deal
' harder to stop.”

Having declared my error and eat-
en humble pie, I wish to go on and
compliment Mr. Norgren on the job
of coaching he has done on this year’s
Maroon five. If ever there was a

ragegd looking bunch, the Chicago
team was it for the first four games
it played. Against Iowa the team
improved greatly. Then it defeated
the strong Wisconsin team (which 1
had proved was impossible) in a very
startling upset. Lax work in cover-
ing Spradling in the last half was all
that lost the Purdue game, and then
Saturday Norgren’s guarding game
held Illinois helpless.

The Chicago defense is as tight a
thing as I have seen in ten years of
Conference basketball. Where it

fense keeps going, Norgren is going
to win a lot of ball games, even in
such a year as this, when there are
as fine a lot of teams in the Big Ten
as in any year, and despite the fact
that it is almost a physical impossibil-
ity for the Chicago team to score
more than twenty points in any game.

WIN FIRST PLACE IN ALL
BUT TWO EVENTS

(Continued from page 3)
events. Weddell, running against
Ex-captains McFarlane and Brick-
man of the Alumni took a very close
third in the 50 yard dash, and re-
peated for another third in the low-
hurdles. Les Beale, Chuck Duval,
Webster, and Cody were other third
place winners for the varsity.

It was the showing of the fresh-
men, however, which looked most
promising to the success of coming
Maroon track teams. Williams, form-
er Hyde Park star, ran the mile in
4 :27 to place second to Krogh, form-
er Maroon ace, who made the re-
maikable time of 4:26%. Burke, an-
other Frosh, was only half second be-
hind his team mate in this event.



“Prosperity too often has the same effect upon it^ possessor
that a calm at sea has on a mariner, uho frequently, it is
said,, in these circumstances ties tip the rudder, gets drunk,
and goes to sleep”

We are today living in a period
of prosperity, what conditions
tomorrow will bring no one
knows. Take care to be an econ-
omist in prosperity; there is no
fear of you being one in adver-
sity.
