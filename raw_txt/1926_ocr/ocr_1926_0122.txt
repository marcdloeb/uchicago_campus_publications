INELIGIBILITIES

Whole Scholastic Standing
Low; Highest Grade Is C
Says Recorder

Numerous and severe upsets in the
scholastic standings of the various
fraternities revealed themselves yes-
terday as the grade chart for the
autumn quarter was released from
th Recorder’s office. Freshmen are
blamed for thesharp decrease in the
general standing as only fifty-seven
per cent of the pledges received grades
high enough for initiation.

Many fraternities raised their
standing including Tau Delta Phi
which went from third to first place:
Pi Lambda Phi, from ninth to second;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, from seven-
teenth to third; Zeta Beta Tau, from
eighteenth to fourth, and Lambda Chi
Alpha, from twenty-fifth to thirteenth
place.

Grading System Blamed

To offset this, other fraternities
took a downward jump. Alpha Sigma
Phi went from nineteenth to thirty-
first; Psi Upsilon from sixteenth to
thirtienth; Acacia, from fifth to
twenty-ninth; Phi Beta Delta, from

fourteenth to twenty-eighth, and
Alpha Epsilon Pi, from first to twen-
tieth place.

In a comparison with the chart giv-
ing the average standings of the fra-
ternities for the three quarters of last
year, the leader on the autumn list
would rank sixth in the list of last
year. In other words, five fraterni-
ties received an average last year that
is higher than the standing of the
first fraternity for the past quarter.
Pledges and the new grading system
are severely criticised by leading fra-
ternity men as the cause for the low-
ering of the general standing.

Pledges Eligible

In number of pledges, Beta Theta
Pi ranks first with twelve out of four-
teen pledges eligible for initiation.
Phi Kappa Sigma and Chi Psi rank
second with nine eligible pledges In
each fraternity, while Sigma Alpha
Epsilon takes third place with eight.

A list of fraternities follow with
their respective grades; Tau Delta

THREE PROFS TO
GIVE INSTRUCTION
AT HOBO COLLEGE

Three professors from the Quad-
rangles will speak at the Hobo col-
lege xext week. Two are from the
faculty of the Theological seminary
and one is from the department of
Political Economy.

The Hobo college is located at 641
Washington Boulevard. About a
thousand runaway boys, gangsters,
tramps, hoboes and bums listen to the
three lectures given every day, ac-
cording to Dr. Ben L. Reitman, di-
rector.

Beside the three lectures, Dr. Reed
of the University department of phy-
sical education, will conduct his reg-
ular Mental Hygiene clinic. This will
come at 11 o’clock Monday morning.

Wednesday at 4, Professor Arthur
Holt, of the Theological seminary,
will speak, and Thursday at the same
hour, Prof. Fred Merrifield will ad-
dress the ragged audience.

Prof. Field of the department of
Political Economy, will speak at 8
o’clock Saturday evening.

“If there is anything good in the
written and spoken word,” declares
Dr. Reitman, “Chicago is better for
the Hobo college.”

MAROON STARTS
“BEAT” SYSTEM

Dire influences are having their
effect as the Maroon Man Hunt for
the campus Apollo waxes warmer. A
political machine—conceived in the
dank recesses of the Law school, and
working with methods reminiscent of
a DeYoung—has entered in the race,
and with a determined influence on
public opinion (as well as an out-
rageous theft of every extra Ma-
roon in the office) has pushed out
far to the front of the other candi-
dates. a new aspirant—Fred Hob-

scheid.

At the last count, late yes-

the Phi Psi protege
the astounding poll

Will Now Cover Every
Field of Activity

Attempting to cover every phase

of the University’s activity.

The

Daily Maroon has inaugurated a new
“beat” system whereby every depart-
ment of the University will be cov-
ered by a Freshman or Sophomore
reporter permanently detailed for
that purpose. Through this method
the Maroon hopes to thoroughly
cover all of its news source and en-
large its scope as an all-University
newspaper.

The reporters will interview the
members of their departments regu-
larly and at least once a week, and
will be responsible for all the news
from that department published. All
checked back to their source before
stories actually written will be
going to the printer. In this way a
fairly high degree of accuracy may
be obtained.

“The Daily Maroon believes that
its readers are interested in the work
of the University,” said Milton Kauf-
man, managing editor, “and that they
would rather read stories of the Uni-
versity’s work written from the
standpoint of the source of the story
than from the viewpoint of an over
clever reporter. The material obtain-
ed from the departments will there-
fore be written with strict attention
to the facts and the viewpoint of the
man who gives the story.”

However, enthusiastic supporters
of Wallie Marks, determined to prove
the ascendancy of spiritual beauty
over the Hobscheidic personality ap-
peal, are continuing to pour in their
ballots with astonishing regularity
and breath-taking dishonesty. Mean-
while, the sudden total of 27 votes
cast for Johnny Meyers prophesy a
hot battle on the part of the Psi U
exponent of all that is good and pure
in man.

tea today at 3:30 in the gymnasium
on the second floor of Ida Noyes hall.
The purpose of this meeting is to ex-

of the organization and the type of
activities it sponsors.

If the weather permits, skating will
be the main entertainment of the
afternoon, according to Eleanor Fish,
president of the organization. The
women will then return to Ida Noyes
hall to play cards and sing college
songs, in order to acquaint the in-
coming freshmen women with the i
University songs. Members of
W. A. A. who were initiated Wednes-
day will entertain the women, and
Dorothy Back will officiate as hostess
for the afternoon. All members of
the organization have been invited to
be present at the meeting.

REVEAL POET-

PROF'S WORK

Dr.

Edward Sapir, Scientist,
Writes for “Poetry”

By Gilbert G. Gilbert

The poet-professor at the Univer-
sity who spends his workdays ponder-
ing the complicated problems of lan-
guage structures of primitive origins,
and of ancient civilization puts in
part of his leisure hours writing bal-
lads, sonnets and imagistic pictures,
it is revealed in the current issue of
1 “Poetry.” Dr. Edward Sapir, his col-

try to framing a constitution for the
new union of stateg, Benjamin Frank-
lin was the first American with a
broad view of his duties as a citizen,
according to Prof. Marcus W. Jerni-
gan of the department of history, who
gave a radio talk last night from Mit-
chell Tower through The Daily News
station, WMAQ.

Aside from Franklin’s well known
services as statesman and diplomat,
he founded the University of Penn-
sylvania, established trust funds for
libraries and public institutes, organ-
ized debating societies, busied himself
with fire and police protection in Phi-
ladelphia, and made a marked suc-
cess as a business man.

Some of the problems with which
he had to cope seem very modern.

“He wrote essays on the cause of
smoky chimneys and on smoke con-
suming stoves. He invented the fa-
mous Franklin stove to provide for
the more economical consumption of
coal,” Prof. Jernegan said. Bi-focal
glasses, the use of fertilizers, and
lightning rods are other improve-
ments to his credit.

from the book of rhymes, “When We

This book furnishes opportunities for
the intorduction of pantomine.

Each of the women’s dormitories on
campus will present an act or stunt;
additional talent will be furnished by
other campus women. “There is great
anticipation of this year’s Vodvil in
view of the excellent stunts which the
halls have put forth in previous
years,” according to. Kathleen Bim-

The Playfest will be presented in

nights, Feb. 5 and 6. The proceeds
are to be donated to the University
Settlement and Day Nurseries.

The three one-act plays chosen for

“Abolish the P. C. requirement for
eligibility to participate in activities.”

“Should a woman be inelibigle be-
cause she is under or over weight?”

“Physical culture should not be re-
quired of University students.”

“Reorganize the women’s physical
education department so that it will
be efficient.”

These are typical of the many criti-
cisms of the physical education policy
of the University, written by seniors
in chapel yesterday, in answer to an
appeal from the undergraduate coun-
cil for suggestions.

Three Major Objections

Perhaps next to the physical cul-
ture regulations, the new system of
“simplified” grading instituted last
quarter, and the contemplated raise in
tuition were allotted the greatest
share of the seniors’ protest. Many
seniors contended that the abolition of
minus grades works an injustice in
either raising or lowering the mark
the student might have received un-
der the old system. On the other hand^
there were those who advocated the
abolition of grades entirely, contend-
ing that a system of “conferences”
should be established, and students
merely passed or failed.

One student had no suggestion to
offer. He wrote, “Newly arrived from
Germany; therefore no criticism.”

Approximately 90 per cent of the
seniors wrote replies on the sheets of
paper given them for the purpose,
which bore across the top the legend,
“All for Chicago,” Charles Anderson,
president of the Undergraduate coun-
cil, states.

Thirty-Six Suggestions

More personal relations should pre-
vail among the students and between
the students and faculty, in the opin-
ion of many of the seniors. One wrote,
“Professors shoul abandon their class
room attitudes whenSningling with
students eleswhere.”

Among the many suggestions of-
fered the following might be listed as

REV. EVANS WILL
CONDUCT SERVICE
IN MANDEL HALL

Rev. David Jones Evans of the
First Baptist Church of Kansas City,
Missouri, will be the speaker at the
Sunday morning services held In
Mandel hall this week. Dr. Evans is
the leader of the largest Bible class
in the world. Under Rev. Evans’
leadership the class has gone from
a membership of 300 to 2,000.

In a contest held in November,
1923, between Dr. Evans’ class and
one in Long Beach, California, a
crowd of 52,321 men came to hear
Dr. Evans. The contest ran five Sun-
days and every conceivable space in
and around,the Convention Hall in
Kansas City was filled to capacity.

Dr. Evans beliebes that the men of
today are interested in religious
matters only in so far as they are
connected with experiences of every-
day life. His sermon then can be in-!

the structures of two phonetic lan-
guages that have no written alpha-
bets. He is at work on an exhaustive
study to show the relation of a group
of American Indian languages to the
primitive Inda-Chines, offering defin-
ite proof that the Indo-Chinese and
these Indians must have a common
origin.

The Daily Maroon,

The University of Chicago,

Chicago, Ill.

Gentlemen:

In yesterday’s issue of the Daily Maroon I read that you are
“searching the Quadrangles” to find among the undergraduates who
is the “Campus Apollo” in order to determine what the elements
of masculine beauty. It is a fine idea if properly carried out. And
I believe it will rouse an interest in the students toward the promo-
tion and preservation of that noble and most perfect creation, the
human body: and consequently a cleaner life.

But according to the method the selection is to be made, it is not
‘The “Apollo” you are looking for, not the elements of manly beauty,
but the very shiek in name and in substance and it seems to me the
whole affair is somehow a joke. In order that the outcome be fair
and worthy of your trouble, let those who care to make the selec-
tion have some knowledge of masculine beauty, and they should
trust neither to the opinion of others alone nor on one’s external ap-
pearance but what really is inside the shell, what is in mind and
body. That only is solid beauty, that is masculine perfection I be-
lieve and that I am sure is what the Apollo represents.

By this method not the shiek of the street but carion (sic) of the
swimming tank will be your choice but who most deserves the honor,
that manly type who if cold penury has wrapped wtih rags you will
not easily recognize in the street.

Very sincerely yours,

George Wilson.

HERE is a man with sense, a man with judgment. The Daily
Maroon agrees with Mr. Wilson. So, we believe, do most of
our readers, and nearly all of our voters. They have, as Mr. Wilson
suggests, some knowledge of masculine beauty, and they trust
neither to the opinion of others alone nor one one s external appear-
ance but what really is inside the shell, what is in mind and body.
We, our readers, and our voters alike agree with Mr. Wilson when
he says, “that only a solid beauty.” Indeed, we can show Wilson
no more convincing argument than this: Let him observe the two
men who now lead the race. Are they shieks of the street ? Do
they (one in particular) make a poor showing in the swimming
tank? Do they not rather exemplify Wilson’s ideal of ‘‘that manly
type who if cold penury has wrapped with rags you will not easily
recognize in the street?

We are happy to second Wilson’s enlightened views. We hope
he seconds ours.

THE SENIORS LOOK US OVER

WHAT students think of their alma mater, and how they diagnose
its ailments, appears in the questionaires filled out in chapel yes-
terday. It is a diagnosis that will facilitate a cure. If you are a
senior, and haven't submitted your complaint, there is still time.

Some of the criticisms are half-baked or superficial; but the rest
contain much worthwhile thought. Perhaps these seniors take their
University a great deal more seriously than their critics believe.

Every sincere, thoughtful complaint will do some good. We can
compare notes with our neighbors, who have suffered the same dif-
ficulties. We shall have before us a cross section of the seniors’ views
on their University. Whether or not the undergraduate council suc-
ceeds in correcting the evils thus reported, we shall have new ideas
on what those evils are.

Air your grievances, seniors. Don’t grumble to yourself and tell
your friends, with a knowing look, that the University could stand
a lot of improvement. Analyze the problem; and fill out a ques-
tionair e.	*

be the least affected by the increase,
may be accepted as criteria.

“Why more tuition?” one wrote,
“The dollar buys as much for the
University as it does for the student.”

And from another: “The raise in
tuition will mean that many students
who must work their way through
college will be unable to continue.”

“Put tuition back to $75,” one senior
writes, “Because the university will
otherwise become a school for the
children of the rich instead of a
school where the most intelligent of
all elosses may have the advantages
of education.”

“More Liberty to Grads”

The exclusion of graduate students
from undergraduate classes was both
advocated and attacked. One senior
contended that it is a form of “unfair
competition,” while another asserted
it is a good influence for the under-
graduates to come in contact with
those who have degrees.

Some of the following suggestions
may or may not have been offered in
sincerity and seriousness:

Permit the girls to have cats
and dogs in the dormitories.

Better beans in the Commons.

Reduce McGinnis.

Relieve the congestion in front

of Cobb hall.

A wide vareity of obviously serious
suggestions, which were not made by
a large number of seniors, include the
fololwing:

Separate the office of athletic
director from the position of foot-
ball coach; it is too much for one
man.

Have smaller classes.

The Blackfriars should make
an annual tour.

Too much reference reading is
required by instructors, impair-
ing students’ eyesight.

Establish the semester plan.

Place polo on a par with other
sports.

Maintain order in the chapel
meetings.

Enforce silence rules in libra-

Heavy attendance on the sidelines
at the intramural Court Games last
evening was well served by some un-
usually exciting games and clever
playing. The league play is drawing
to a close now and the games are
becoming more important and bet-
ter played. Two officials were used
for several of the more important
contests.	__

Phi Gam Forced

Phi Gamma Delta was forced to
the limit in defeating Delta Kappa
Epsilon 19-16 in one of the best
games of the year. Both teams went
into the fray with unbeaten records
and equal chances to win their league
title. The Dekes, led by Webster,
took the lead and held a 5 to 0 ad-
vantage when the Phi Gams got going
in time to get ahead at half time
10 to 8. Bob Grant, with five buckets,
helped the victors to retain the lead
throughout the second half.

Lambda Chi Outweighed

Phi Kappa Psi downed a greatly
out weighed Lamb* Chi Alpha team
by the score of 22 to 5. The looser?
put up a fighting game, but found
the height of their opponents too
great an obstacle. “Woo” Laverty,
Phi Psi captain, was high scorer with
14 points.

Pei U Upset

Phi Sigma Delta upset the Psi Up-
silon quintet 25 to 16 and kept their
undefeated record. Priess and Zolla
tied for high honors and four baskets
apiece an<l exhibited some classy
team work with Caplow, the other
Phi Sig forward. Lott and Freeman
played well for the loosers.

Close Game

Probably the closest game of the
evening was the Phi Beta Delta-Tau
Delta Phi contest, which resulted in
an 11 to 8 last minute victory for
the Phi Betes. Almost the whole line-
up of the winning five broke into the
scoring column. Perlstein leading with
three points, while only one basket
was registered by the Tau Delts.
Dattlebaum getting it.

High Point Maker

Cohen, stellar forward on the Tau
Sig five, took the high point honors
for the evening in contributing 16
points to the 23 to 9 victory which
his team registered over the Delta
Chi outfit. Perkins, at guard also
played well for the winners, while
O’Malley and. Eller were the Delta
best for the losers.

Illini Begin Spring
Football Practice

Urbana, Ill., Jan. 21.—Although
the basket season is hardly begun,
Illinois has issued a call for spring
football practice to begin Feb. 8. In
the absence of Coach Zuppke, who is
now in California, Milt Olander will
take charge of the squad.

The loss of “Red” Grange has been
an added incentive to the coaches to
disprove the oft uttered statement
that Illinois has been a one man team
for the past three years.



Due to the recent change in per-
sonnel in the circulation depart-
ment, in which F. H. Kretschmer
was made Circulation Manager,
there may be a few cases at first
in which a subscriber is not re-
ceiving his Maroon regularly. It
will be appreciated if any non-
delivery is reported, so that the
delivery service can be perfected
as soon as possible.

FORMER LEADERS

TO RUN IN MEET

An imposing array of former cap-
tains and record holders will take Bart-1
lett floor tonight in the anual friendly '
meet between the alumni, varsity and :
fremman track forces. The meet which !
is carded for 7:30 will be preceded by
a dinner in the Hutchinson Commons
for the grads and varsity team mem- I
bers.

Many Former Stars to Compete

Among the former greats who will !
perform are the names of MacFarlane.
Krough, Bourke, Brickman, Kassel. |
Menaut, Ward, Stout, Higgins, Russell, I
Graham. Fisher, and Harris. All of
these men have made University rec-
ords. They will be reinforced by
others so that the alumni ranks will
number about 25. Against them Tom '
Eck will use a squad of some 60 var-
sity tracksters while Lonnie Stagg ex- '
pects to employ about 30 yearlings to
make glory for the first year class.

Meet Should Be Interesting

The meet should develop into an
interesting one for although there is
no question about the ability of th?
grads there is some doubt about their
condition. In this the regular track-
men will have a decided advantage. It
will afford varsity an excellent chanc?
for preparation for the coming dual
meet with the Hoosiers. All of the
regulars will. face stiff contpetion as
the alumni have their entries well pro-
portioned among the various events.

All the regular indoor season events
.vill be included in this meet. They
are the 50 and 440 yard dashes, the 50
yard high and low hurdles, the mile
and half-mile, the shot put, pole vault,
high jump and relay.	1

I Coach MacGillivray will head his
team toward Ann Arbor for the sec-
ond dual meet of the season Satur-
day night. Captain Noyes’ swimmers
! will have a hard time when they meet
| the powerful Michigan splashers who
are reputed to have one of the strong-
est teams entered in the Big Ten

• Conference race. The water polo
i teamcaptain by Petrolowitz will
1 have things more their own way than
I will the swim crew, but a close score
। is expected.

Show Real Form

The Chicago swimmers showed
championship calibre last week in de-
feating the Indiana water men and
there is an even break in the chance
of their repeating their initial per-
formance.

Captain Noyes has an excellent
chance of capturing the crawl sprints
and Harry Rittenhouse is being de-
pended upon for touching second in
the same.

Mydal and Diamond will have a
hard fight against Morrie Shore in
the breastroke bur after reviewing
the times made by the Chicago men
in the last meet MacGillivray is plac-
ing a great deal of confidence in his
protegees to come through in one
two order.

“This is a fine opportunity to win

The Daily Maroon undertakes
one of the most difficult tasks that
confronts sports writers when it
forecasts basketball results. Foot-

Two brilliant offensive teams
meet when Purdue meets Indiana,

Tomorrow night’s forecasts are:

DEFEAT PHI GAM

Maple flew and Mineralite balls

club when the first of the inter-Greek
bowling matches w#re rolled. The Chi

consecutive games by the small total of
33 pins,. Although no high scores were
annexed the boiling was all of a
steady character.

Me Marten had the high score for
the game with a total of 145 and also
the high score for the two games with
205. Tomorrow afternoon Sigma Chi
will take on Sigma Xu in a match
which was postponed from today while
the Dekes will attempt to down the

Tough Fight Expected

The backstroke event will be de-
fended by Jelinek, Hammel and
Kaatz and they will have to do their
outmost to cope with the strength
of their op> onents, while Jerry
Greenburg and C. Lane will have no
easier time in the four forty.

Fel^hger and Wilder are in fine
shape and have been pointing for
the oncoming meet. All in all the
chances are equally divided for a vic-
tory and a very close contest is ex-

Zuppke’s crashing fullback, who
scored a mere five baskets and five
free throws against Michigan.

At the other forward is Capt.
Mauer who has the knack of sinking
baskets at the psychological moment
when a basket means victory. Martin
at center, though outplayed by the
giant Cunningham is one of the best
centers in the Big Ten.

But after the way Sackett’s tight
guarding stopped the sensational
Cramer, Boilermaker star, the Ma-
roons should stop him. Haines, who
sometimes jumps center, frequently
is shifted to guard and with Chuck
Kassel forms a strong guarding com-
bination. The veteran Reynolds alter-
nates at guard.

Craig Ruby’s veteran Illini five will j
receive their first taste of the now
famous Maroon guarding, when the I
Downstaters clash with Norgren’s I
cagemen tomorrow night at Bartlett I
Gym. By virtue of their victory over
the hitherto unbeaten Wolverines,
the Illini are given a slight edge over
the locals in what promises to be a
bitterly contested battle. But then
again, if the Maroons exhibit the
quality of guarding they displayed
against Purdue in the first half, the
Champaign eagers are not due to he
on intimate terms with the basket.

Dear Maw and Paw and Aunt Kate—
Well, as all we girls say here, how
are the the breaks coming? School
quarter has started again and I sure
have some swell courses—Eng. and
Gen. Lit. and Bib Lit. My English
prof’s a young fella who wears red
ties and gray shirts and sorta green-
ish suits and a overcoat and cap. He’s
always smoking ciggarrettes before
class and after class and everywhere,
and the other day in class he said
“dam” right out loud. My Gen. Lit.
prof ain’t so “hot”, as we girls all
say here. That is, he’s getting kinda
oldish and I guess that accounts for
its basically and fundamentally to a
certain extent. Eh . . . what? And
our Bib. Lit. prof . . . ummm . . .
young, swell clothes, manicure, ties.
But I guess tl at’s enough in relation
to the extent and capacity of the
courses which I am persooing this
'Winter quarter 1926.

Around here, paw, the dollar has
been gettin turrible anaemic and it’s
going to cost more next year for
