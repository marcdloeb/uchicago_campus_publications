UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, THURSDAY, OCTOBERM 4, 1926	Price Five Cento

WHAT OF

You might expect us to be differ-
ent! Down at Illinois, or at nearly
any other place, it’s “Dad’s Day.”
Do we fall in line? Not so: it’s “Fa-
ther’s Day” here—the twenty-third
when Purdue comes up to make its
yearly stand on Stagg Field, in case
you haven’t read The Maroon. If it
were “Dad’s Day,” I should expect
something like the air of a Kiwanis
convention to hang over the univer-
sity on the twenty-third; probably
there would be much horn-tooting,
back-slapping, and waving and wear-
ing of the old Maroon—if it were
“Dad’s Day.” But it isn’t; it’s “Fa-
ther’s Day,” and so I look forward
to a more or less restrained exhibi-
tion of paternal interest in “the boy”
and “the eleven.” The phrase “Fa-
ther’s Day” suggests silver-rimmed
glasses, mild-looking old men, and
heart-to-heart talks. I have seen
“Dad’s Day” in its pristine state at
the University of Illinois in my day,
so I feel that, after all, “Father’s
Day” is all for the best.

What happens to the “big men on
campus” when they get out of school?
This query is prompted by a forlorn
spectacle which I witnessed the oth-
er day. It happened in the Maroon
office. I was looking around aimless-
ly, as I sometimes do, when I noticed
a familiar figure stride in. The fig-
ure stopped directly in the center of
the room, surrounded on all sides by
teeming activity. Reporters rushed
hither and yon, waving yellow pa-
per about wildly. Various persons in
an executive capacity stood around
looking preoccupied. The turmoil
surged around the lone figure; no
one spoke to him, no one paid him
the slightest bit of attention. Disre-
garded, he stood there, lonely in the
solitude of the rushing mob. It was
only Al Heald, last year’s editor.

That incident is typical of the cam-
pus attitude towards the boys who
were, but are no more. In their day,
they swung (in the argot of the
Cobb between-period loungers)
things by the tail in whistling circles
around their ears. Now they’re out.
Nobody hears of them any more.
When occasionally they do drop i^
on the campus, no one particularly
cares. “What of it?” the new heads
about the old school ask. And so it
is. Mostly, however, the former “big
men” are heard of, it at all, through
stray reports, blow in with the wind,
once they get out of college. Their
lot, as a rule, is obscurity. And still
the campus goes on in the old way,
as it always has. New faces, new
“big men” are shuffled out of the
pack, to fill the old places. To top
off this plaint on things past, in the
right way, I feel I ought to drag in
a quotation. I hesitate, however,
in choosing between two—both more
or less apropos. So I give you your
choice: “Gone, gone, all the old fa-
miliar faces,” or “Ou sont les neiges
d’antan?”

The class elections, I hear, are
only a couple of days off, so I rise
up out of my chair to offer what I
consider a constructive suggestion
to the Undergraduate Council, or
whoever else legislates over the me-
chanics of the business. That sug-
gestion is to hold the elections ac-
cording to the rules of Hoyle—or
anybody else, for that matter, not
identified with the name Hare. But
when I reflect how narrowly I miss-
ed having to lead the Sophomore-
Freshman prom last spring, I lose my
bitterness for Mr. Hare and his sys-
tem. It isn’t so bad, after all.

SEND OFF MAROONS AT NOON

ASSIGN DUTIES
TO GREEN CAP

MEN AT NOON

Period of Intensive Frosh
Discipline Starts

Today

Today is a fatal day in the his-
tory of this year’s Green Cap club.
At the meeting in the circle this noon
the freshman will be given instruc-
tions as to the various duties which
they will be expected to perform.

The officers of the sophomore hon-
or societies promise an interesting
time for all freshmen who are caught
on campus without their green caps
or who are found going across cam-
pus at anything less than a run.
Those who have not learned the
songs and yells are also promised
a reception.

Cappers Will Paint “C”

Among the tasks which are to be
assigned to the freshmen is the
painting of the “C” on the stands
in the student section of the new sta-
dium. They will probably set about
this job on Saturday afternoon, if
present plans are carried out.

In the future they will be required
to sit on the lines of the “C” at the
home football games and form the
backbone of the student cheering sec-
tion. Every freshman who expects to
make the Green Cap Club should be
in the circle today as near 12 o’clock
as possible to give the team a big
send-off. Those who have classes
must attend them.

Featuristic Writers
Needed for Maroon

Friday Supplement

All students interested in writing
feature stories for the Friday feature
section of The Daily Maroon have
been requested to report to Alice
Kinsman tomorrow or any day n • ;
week at 2:30 in the Maroon office.

Book reviews, theatrical criticisms,
interviews, human interest stories
and feature articles on campus life
will be needed. This is an opportun-
ity for everybody who is interested
in journalistic work and feature writ-
ing to express themselves in a ca i
pus publication, according to Miss
Kinsman.

The first issue of the literary sup-
plement will appear in tomorrow’s
Maroon with articles by William Jost
who will conduct a theater column
each week and Lucille Price-Benedict,
who will write reviews on new bocks.
The literary section was supplement-
ed for the first time last year, and
met with campus approval at that
time.

Call for Women
Concert Ushers

University women who wish to
usher for The Chicago Symphony
Orchestra Concerts on Tuesday
afternoons at 3 o’clock should
make applications by telephone or
by writing to Marion Plimpton,
6027 University Avenue before
Saturday. The concert season is
from October 19 to April 19.

Miss Plimpton urges all Uni-
versity women to apply as it is a
rare opportunity to hear the Sym-
phony Orchestra and compara-
tively little time need be given.
All applicants will have a chance
to usher later in the season if the
positions are already filled. Wom-
en chosen to usher on Tuesday
will be notified by letter from The
University Orchestral Association.

Council Votes To
Back Program Of
1st “Fathers’Day”

Another boost was given “Father’s
Day” yesterday when the Undergrad-
uate council passed a resolution
pledging its support to the new activ-
ity. It voted funds for the mailing
of letters to the fathers of all Uni-
versity undergraduates.

Late last night 3,300 letters bear-
ing the signature of President Max
Mason were addressed and put in
the mails by the committee in charge
of Father’s Day. Self addressed en-
velopes were enclosed which must be
mailed back to the committee early
next week so that reservations may
be made for the dinner on the eve-
ning of Saturday, Oct. 23.

Students who expect their fathers
here on Oct. 23 have been requested
to make reservations in the special
block of seats for the Chicago-Pur-
due football game by Monday, Oct.
18. Other events planned for Fa-
ther’s Day are a tour of the campus,
open house in Reynolds club, a din-
ner in Reynolds, and a student vau-
deville program in Mandel hall.

At its meeting yesterday the Un-
dergraduate council declared itself in
sympathy with the new activity and
eager to cooperate with the commit-
tee in putting over the first Father’s
Day.

S.A.E.1NN0VATES
NEW AIRPOLICY

WLS Broadcasts Program
of Fraternity Songs

Inaugurating an innovation in ra-
dio entertainment, Station WLS,
broadcasting from Sears, Roebuck &
Company will put Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon fraternity on the air tonight
at 10:30.

The program, being conducted in
the nature of an experiment, will
consist of fraternity songs and stunts,
Sigma Chi will sing their songs
next Tuesday at 10:30, including in
their repertoire the famous “Sweet-
heart of Sigma Chi.” No further
arrangements have been made, the
broadcasters preferring to wait un-
til the experiment has been tried,
before planning additional pro-
grams.

NOW WE KNOW WHY
THE PRESS CHARGES

SO MUCH FOR CAPS

At last it is out. Why do green
caps, such as are worn by the fresh-
men, cost more when they are pur-
chased at the University Bookstore?
The caps sold at this place are made
to sell at sixty cents, the same price
as is asked elsewhere for similar
cap but forty cents is added to the
price, and turned over to the Under-
graduate Council.

This additional charge for green
caps takes the place of dues in the
Green Cap organization and is used
to support such undergraduate activ-
ities as the freshman week mixer.

BEG YOUR PARDON

The following names were omitted
from the Phi Beta Delta pledge list:

Carl Meadows, Walter Hart, Carl
Kahn, Bernard Landy, Joseph- Pinko-
witz, Harold Johnson, Edward Sil-
verman and Leonard Fuchs.

This swells the total list of pledges
for the year to 338. This is fifty-
one more than were pledged fall
quarter last year.

GREEN CAP MEN
START PARADE;

BANDJENLISTED

Grand March Leaves Campus
At 12:25

Sharp

Striking up the tune of “Wave the
Flag of Old Chicago” in front of
Mitchell tower, as soon as the last
“amen” has been pronounced in
chapel today, the University band
will signal the beginning of the huge
pep session and sendoff for the
team.

The sendoff is an effort to make
the team feel although a horde of
rooters will not be in the stands at
Franklin Field Saturday afternoon,
the spirit of the University will fol-
low them through to the East.

Time la Limited

And when the Staggmen buck up
against the Quakers in one of the
biggest intersectional clashes of the
football season, the first whistle will
carry with it the echo of the last
cheer at the station today.

Only five minutes times has been
allowed for the team’s followers to
get off campus after they assemble
in front of Mitchell in order that the
parade may be under way by 12:25
so that it will not interfere with
12:30 classes.

Line of March

The escort will gather at 12:20,
and after a few preliminary cheers
and yells, will march down Ellis Av-
enue, meeting the team at Bartlett
gymnasium.

From Bartlett, the line of march
is west on 57th Street, through Wash-
ington Park and south to the Mid-
way, and then west to the Engle-
wood station,, where the squad boards
the train for Philadelphia at 1:17.

PRESIDENT MASON
OFF TO EAST FOR
PENN-MAROON TILT

President Max Mason, will witness
the Pennsylvania-Chicago football
game as the guest of Harold E. Swift,
president of the board of trustees
of the university,

The meat packer is host to a group
of friends who leave Friday in Mr.
Swift’s private coaches over the
Pennsylvania Railroad, reachin the
Quaker City Saturday morning.

While Mr. Swift and the majority
of his party plan to return immedi-
ately after the fray, President Ma-
son will remain in the east on ad-
ministration business. The President
leaves his office primarily for this
latter purpose.

Tradition at many schools demands
the attendance of the institution’s
president at all football games, but
Chicago has never imposed this privi-
lege on its prexies. Mr. Mason, has,
however, attended both Maroon vic-
tories this season.

Cap And Gaum Selects Official Photographers; Large
Staff Opens Year; Offers Subscriptions At Four Dollars

With the selection of the Morri-
son Studio as official photographer,
the Cap and Gown started its year’s
work yesterday.

The Morrison Studio is located in
the Garrick Building, 64 W. Ran-
dolph Street, and all Seniors who
wish to have their photograph in the
Cap and Gown should make an ap-
pointment in the near future. The
office is open from 9 till 6; and for
the special accommodation of the
University students it remains open
until 9 and on Sundays from 10 till
6.

Sophs ’ Petitions
For Nominations

Total But Four

Only four petitions for class of-
fices, two men for president and two
men for treasurer had been present-
ed to the Undergraduate council by
the Sophomore class when nomina-
tions closed yesterday at noon.
Names of the nominees will be an-
nounced today, along with the re-
sults of the Junior class nominations
according to Wendell Bennet, presi-
det of the council.

Junior petitions for class offices
will be accepted until noon today,
while the Senior lists remain open
until noon tomorrow. No nominations
are being made in chapel this year,
the Undergraduate Council accepting
nominees only on petition signed
with ten names.

The change was necessitated when
it was learned that speakers had al-
ready been engaged for chapel this
week. In the case of the Sophomore
class, Bennett said that provision had
been, made to care for the deficiency
in nominations, but would not be an-
nounced until today.

It is understood that nominations
will be reopened to the Sophomores
for with no candidates named for
vice-president and secretary, elections
cannot be held for those offices.

OF SWIFT HALL

Theology Building Is Gift
of Mrs. A. H. Swift •

Stonecutters are completing the
task of inscribing over the entrance
of the new University Theology
building the title “Swift Hall,” thus
announcing indirectly for the first
time the name of the donor of the
building—Mrs. Ann Higgin Swift.

The structure was completed and
dedicated last spring under the tem-
porary name of Theology building,
and last summer the wedding of
Claire Dux the opera star and Chas.
Swift was held in the nearby Joseph
Bond chapel, constructed simultane-
ously for the use of the divinity
school.

TRYOUTS FOR FROSH
PLAY TODAY AT 4:30
ON REYNOLDS STAGE

Trials for the freshman play will
be held this afternoon in the Rey-
nolds club theater at 4:30. All men
and women interested in securing
positions on the staff or in the cast
will try out at this time for the play
which is to be held two weeks from
tomorrow.

Appointments may be made by
calling Central 2719. As is custom-
ary Seniors will pay two dollars for
the photography and engraving.
Since Morrison’s are a new studio
it is imperative that all Seniors have
their pictures taken there as pic-
tures taken last year will not be
available. The deadline has been set
at November 5 for fraternity men
and November 15 for club women.
The staff sends out an urgent plea to
have the photography done early.

BAND GETS NEW
SUITS; TO WEAR
SWEATERS, TROU

Model After Uniforms
Used Last Year

By Dartmouth

In maroon sweaters and white
flannel ^trousers, the Maroon band
will march bareheaded, to the foot-
ball field for the Purdue game, it
was announced today by Moss Em-
mett Wilson, director. For the first
time the band is suitably equipped
to represent Chicago.

In 1921 the band first conceived
the idea of regular collegiate band
uniforms. At this time, however, the
idea did not receive the president’s
sanction. The bandmen, disliking
the unorganized appearance of street
clothes, provided themselves with
Maroon sweaters and white trousers.

Discard Suits

These makeshift uniforms were
soon disposed of and the band was
furnished with old, discarded army
uniforms.

These were not suitable to repre-
sent a large university however and
last year after especially searing
comment the students in the band
decided to strike for uniforms. This
old method of securing “shorter
hours and more wages” was suffi-
cient and the Band was furnished
with the uniforms which is now dis-
carding. Not however before a foot-
ball game or two had passed without
musical accompaniment and the band
men were found to be in earnest
was this done.

Resembled “Circus”

Since the uniforms that are to be
disposed of were bought they have
come to be known as “circus uni-
forms,” and many are of the opinion
that they would grace the Ringling

Daily Maroon Has
Office Repaired But

Work Is Continued

Improvements are being made in *
the office of The Daily Maroon. The
business and editorial departments
are being separated by a railing, and
a booth is being constructed for the
convenience of the circulation de-
partment. Business is going on as
usual but the changes have been
causing a great deal of confusion
for the last few days. The pounding
of hammers drowns the tack, tack
of typewriters and the shrieks of
saws and places mingle with the
exhortations of the editors. The new
arrangement of things doubtless will
be of great value but it reduces the
floor space to a considerable extent.

tors, business managers and report-
ers alike work in a jumble of lum-

tools.

scriptions at this rate may be pro-
cured at the Reynolds Club, at Ida

To the Editor of the Maroon,
.Sir:

I have been at once honored and
dismayed by the attention thrust
upon my Lillipution effort in the New
Student. It was nearly a year ago
that I wrote the sketch, which may
account for its apparent immaturity.
The viewpoint reflected may have
been mine at the time but it was
thickly interlarded with fiction for
the sake of the artistic whole. Need-
less to say, I intended it to be taken,
like the book of Genesis, with a plen-
tiful supply of salt. I consider it a
pity that the Maroon dragged it into
the light of day from its comparative-
ly obscure repose. Such trifling an-
noyances should be to the University
of Chicago like a gnat to a mam-
moth. Let her shake her mighty
sides and proceed upon her way.

Yours truly,

Sterling North.

NO COVER CHARGE

ON “SCOUTING”

/"ANGE more Princeton and Yale lead. Coach Roper of Princeton
and Coach Jones of Yale have agreed to stop scouting each
other’s football games. Their agreement is a notable step in the
right direction, the direction of true amateurism in athletics.

For the benefit of those who are not aware of the situation we
shall explain. Almost every football coach in the country who has
the necessary funds in his athletic treasury has on his payroll a scout,
or in ugly words, a hired spy. The scout is dispatched to the camps
of the team's prospective enemies, where he watches the preliminary
games and possibly the practice sessions of each enemy team. The
scout reports to his employer the tactics, general style of play and
particular plays of each enemy team, and recommends good defence
measures and counter-attacks.

In football as well as in other things the American is interested
in winning. The tremendous expenditure of men, money and in-
terest involved in the whole football situation is concentrated on the
business of winning at almost any cost. Scouting is one of the least
desirable phases of this passion to win.

The most promising aspect of the Yale-Princeton compact is
that the move has been made by the coaches themselves, and not
through the influence of those who look upon football as a big bull
in the academic china-shop. Restriction from above by university
authorities could never have turned the trick.

Yale and Princeton have made a real step forward. The “great
hinterland" universities west of the Alleghanies have taken from the
Big Three their one-time claim to intellectual and athletic supremacy.
But in this new move Yale and Princeton are once more leaders.

Professor L. Levy-Bruhl of the
Sorbonne, University of Paris, au-
thor of numerous books on philoso-
phy, and editor of the “Revue Phil-
osophique,” will lecture on “Recent
Philosophy in France,” Monday at
4:30, in Harper Assembly hall.

Professor Levy-Bruhl has become
famous through his pursuit of two
types of work. He has sought to
study morals in relation to manners
and customs of people, rather than
to a fixed system, based on establish-
ed conduct and intuition. He is best
known in recent times for his spe-
cial study of the mental life of the
primitive peoples in society. He
points out a decided difference in
the whole process of savage thought.

The professor came to the United
States with several French colleague
to attend the International Congress
of Philosophers held from Sept. 13
to 18 at Harvard. He has been lec-
turing in California.

MORE ON THE BAND

T^OR ages and ages, in fac^ since the University band was first
formed, the uniformed gentlemen who parade, play instruments
and perjorm similar tricks for our inspiration on auspicious occasions
have been the object of much ridicule. True, they have been at times
a sorry lot, but the blame for this condition has not been properly
placed. Possibly undergraduate apathy was as much to blame as
anything.

Last year the band, after years of suffering, went on strike.
They got what they wanted—new uniforms, uniforms that didn’t
make them look like clothing dummies from the windows of Barney’s
Army Store. This year conditions have been changed again.

At the Chicago-Purdue game the band will again sport new
uniforms. White flannel trousers, maroon sweaters, and no hats.
This sounds fine. And besides being an improvement over the mis-
fits in vogue a few years ago it will put the University band, our
band, among the best in the Conference. For what other band has
abandoned the old-fashioned uniform of military cut for the more
modern ones, equally nice looking, and far more comfortable?

Possibly the band has been rather dreadful in the past. But
that period is finished. There’s no reason to be ashamed of it now.

STAGG TAKES SQUAD OF THIRTY MEN TO BATTLE QUAKERS

VARSITY BATTLES

FROSH IN LAST
HOME PRACTICE

Yearling Line Uses Penn’s
Famous Six-Men

Defense

Thirty Maroon football men will
make the trip to Philadelphia for the
Penn game Saturday, and most of
them will have a first-hand opportun-
ity to try to solve the easterners’
much-heralded deceptive attack.

The following men will be taken
Center s—K. Rouse, Olwin;
Guards—Wolff, Cochran, Neff, Heit-
mann, Clark, and Hancock; Tackles
—Lewis, Weislow, Cameron, Borden,
and Garen; Ends—Apitz, Spence,
Stickney, Krogh and Hoerger; Quar-
terbacks—McDonough, Fulton, and
Dygert; Halfbacks—Anderson, S.
Rouse, McKinney, Gleason and Ray-
sson; Fullbacks—Marks, Libby, Ley-
ers, and Klein.

Practice Varied

In their final practice session last
night the varsity was sent through
a stiff offensive scrimmage against
the freshmen. During the first half
of the scrimmage stress was
laid on forward-pass plays while in
the second half the varsity used
crushing line smashes exclusively.
The freshmen were using a six-man
line on defense the same as the
Quakers use and they exhibited a
stubborn defense throughout the
scrimmage.

Several of the first string men
werd on the sidelines nursing various
minor ailments but “Doc” Molander
asserts that everybody will be avail-
able for the tough Penn game Sat-
urday. McDonough, who was slight-
ly injured in the Maryland game, was
not used in scrimmage, but spent
considerable time catching punts
from the toe of Asst. Coach Nor-
gren. The South Dakotan is certain
to start at quarterback Saturday.

Attack Undecided

It is quite possible that Stagg will
depend as much on a powerful run-
ning attack as on the overhead game
Saturday. If Pennsylvania scores
the three touchdowns or so that are
generally conceded them because of
their baffling offensive and the Ma-
roon line’s inexperience, it will, of
course, be necessary for the Maroons
to resort to the forward passing
game to score quickly. However, if
the Maroon forwards outplay the
easterners’ powerful linesmen Sat-
urday, and effectively check their
opponents’ offensive, fans may look
forward to witnessing an excellent
demonstration of Stagg’s well con-
ceived line plays—a conservative
safety-first type of game.

Indiana Trophy Room
And Caretaker Take
New1 Lease on Life

By Victor Roteru*

In the University of Inidana trophy
room thirty-four mounted footballs
adorn the walls. They proclaim the
thirty-four conference football vic-
tories that Indiana has won since
1899, an average of one and three-
tenths victories per season.

Each year Sergt. S. B. Gibson,
who is in charge of the decorations
of the room, has dolefully cut the
one or two footballs in half, tearfully
painted the one half with the school
colors of the opponent and the other
with crimson, almost sobbingly out-
lined the score of the season’s lone
victory in white, and with a heavy
sigh hung the halves up on the wall.
The football teams in Indiana’s past
history have been lenient with Sergt.
Gibson; his team has been meager.
But he has not been satisfied; his
great heart yearns for more work,
for more footballs to halve, to shel-
lac, to hang up. The bare kalso-
mine glares at him without compas-
sion and before it Sergt. Gibson’s
martial soul quakes.

Take Measures to Fill Room

Indiana officials have been silently
cognizant of Sergt. Gibson’s sorry
plight. They have known his unhap-
py lot but not until this year have
they acted. Two measures were tak-
en to make Sergt. Gibson a merrier
man, to give him a rosier future to
look forward to. The first was to per-
mit him to slice not only the balls
marking conference triumphs but
also those denoting non-conference
wins. The second measure was to
hire Pat Page, athletic pedagogue ex-
traordinary, as coach of the team.

The measures have both taken ef-
fect. Already DePauw and Kentucky
have been defeated by Indiana. Al-
ready Sergt. Gibson has Ayhat was
previously his season’s quota of balls.
And the critics assure him that
more victories and more balls are
forthcoming.

Former Maroon Sporting
Editor Gives Dope On

Equipment

In a recent article in the Big Ten
Weekly, William V. Morgenstern,
former sports editor of The Daily
Maroon and brother of the Maroon
columnist, George Morgenstern, has
the following to say about the new-
est things in the line of football
clothing:

“It is figured that the armour
each player wears during the season
costs closely enough to $150 to call
it that. And since there are an
average of thirty-five men to be out-
fitted, the equipment of the varsity
team costs over $5,000.

New Equipment Much Different

There is as much difference be-
tween the equipment of today of
the players, and the playing para-
phanelia of twenty years ago, when
the boys wore quilted trousers and
mustaches as there is between the
women’s dress of the periods. Foot-
ball has its fashion designers as well
as Paris, and like women’s styles the
trend is toward lighter stuff. The
football players outfit today, from
chapeau to cleats weights about four-
teen pounds, five ounces which is
about seven pounds lighter than the
equipment of three years ago.

The latest thing in football style is
satin pants, weighing two ounces less
than the old canvas duck. The new
breeches are mostly for looks, how-
ever, as the pads are made separate-
ly and are strapped or taped on. And
instead of the invariable khaki color
of former days, the new pants come
in any color desired.

The shoulder pads used now are
made of a rubber foam that is half
as heavy as the old leather and has
the added advantage of not absorb-
ing the perspiration.

Stanley Rouse Is

Wales’ New Rival

According to Stanley Rouse ev-
eryday football practice does not
at all furnish enough exercise. Two
hours of intensive drilling a day
and a puny little game on Satur-
day only serve as mild muscie
warmers. This condition finally
became unbearable so Stanley
rented a little pony last Sunday
afternoon and started on a jaunt
to Lake Geneva.

The first two miles were trav-
ersed successfully. However at
the end of the distance mentioned
Rouse executed a perfect “Prince
of Wales.” Fortunately no cas-
ualties were suffered in the acci-
dent. But Stan decided that the
horse had had a good day’s exer-
cise and he walked it back to the
stables. When questioned Stan
answered that the exercise had not
sufficed, but that no horse would
cheat him out of his trip to Penn-
sylvania.

TICKETS TO GAME
STILL OBTAINABLE

For the information of those who
decide to make the Penn trip at the
last minute, it has been announced
that tickets for the game are still
available at the Football Tickets
Committee Office located in the west
stand of Stagg Field.

Despite the opposition of the fac-
ulty to student migrations a specif
train is being run' by The Pennsyl-
vania Lines. The train will leave the
Englewood Union Station at 1:05 p.
m. Friday, arriving at Philadelphia
at 8:00. The return train will leave
the Quaker City at 11:50 Saturday
night and will arrive in Chicago at
5:30 Sunday morning.

TOUCHBALL GETS OFF TO POSTPONED

Twenty-Six Fraternities
Enter Barnyard Golf

Tourney

There was a real ‘Old Home Town’
atmosphere hovering over the Intra-
mural Horseshoe Courts yesterday af-
ternoon, when the “barn-yard golf”
experts from twenty-six different
fraternities met to show their oppon-
ents just how that small town game
should be played. Old Man Weather
was there,, too, lending a cheerful
smile to the occasion and making up
in part for the dismal way he treated
the Greek athletes on the day before,
when all of the opening Touchball
Games had to be postponed.

Shirt-sleeves were in style in yes-
terday’s battles, especially when the
scoring was close. Many of the hurl-
ers exhibited mid-summer form when
it was needed, several close contests
resulted.

Several teams secured their vic-
tories in quick fashion by taking the
first two games of the series. These
were Beta Theta Pi, Alpha Tau Ome-
ga, Sigma Nu, Phi Kappa Sigma, and
Kappa Sigma who defeated S. A. E.,
Kappa Nu, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi
Gamma. Delta, and Zeta Beta Tau re-
spectively. The closer games v/ere
the Acacia win over Phi Delta Theta,
Delta Chi’s victory over Phi Beta
Delta and the Alpha Delt loss to Phi
Sigma Delta. Sigma Chi, Delta Tau
Delta, Pi Lambda Phi and Tau Del-
ta Phi won their contests on forfeits.

rain put the damper on Tuesday’s
program.

Psi U’s Play

The headliner on today’s bill is the
Psi U-Phi Delt Game, which will
throw some light on the attack of the
former outfit. They are rumored to
have even a stronger team than the
one which took championship honors
last fall. Included in the line-up will
be Chi Gordon, former Maroon full-
back and George Lott, famous ten-
nis player.

Many of the teams engaged in
practice games yesterday afternoon,
on the regular fields across the Mid-

not rain again today.

To be absolutely truthful, we
must admit a Wahl Pen will
not get up and make your 8
o’clocks for you. It won’t an-
swer the roll call, or take notes
all by itself.

But it will go along with you
to any class you have, and do
a better writing job than any
other fountain pen you’ve
ever seen. Hour after hour, it
will glide across the pages with
an ease that rests your wrist
and leaves your mind free to
consider what you’re writing.

Its iridium-tipped point of sol-
id gold will stand up to the
action when the “prof.” is talk-
ing fast and you just have to
“jab ’em down,” or it will roll
the rounded out sentences
when you’re building a theme

for somebody else to read.

This most serviceable and
handsome pen comes in a
wide variety of materials and
styles. In slim, symmetrical
cylinders of solid gold or ster-
ling silver,gold-filled or silver-
filled, or in red, black, or mot-
tled rubber. For point, you
can choose exactly the Wahl
nib that suits your writing
style: stiff or flexible, fine,
medium, stub, oblique, or
Wahl Standard Signature.

And, oh, yes! A Wahlful of
ink is a bookful of words,
whether you’re passing an
exam or writing out your al-
ibi. Fiil up a new one at the
Wahl Pen and Eversharp
counter and see if it isn’t so.

REALIZATION

This thing that has stirred in us, by
some strange chance,

Call it not love.... for it will soon
be past.

But this.... this is a fleeting thing,
Lovely and fragile as dust on any
moth’s wing,

And only as long as moth dust shall
it last.

Who knows how it was roused....
perhaps a glance

That leapt between us like a sudden
flame

And . stirred . those . longings . that
know no name,

Perhaps a word.... perhaps a ges-
ture gay....

What matters it? For you today
The gods Have flung their gifts,
So take them while you may....
Tomorrow go on.. remembering me
Only as one who paused a time to
pl*y

At love along the way.

was over the ball rested on the Tau
Sig 3 yard line.

Deke 8, Tau Delt 0

Delta Kappa Epsilon was victor
over Tau Delta Phi by the score of
8-0. The half ended with a score of
0-0. In the second half by a beauti-
ful exhibition of long runs the Dekes
put over the ball for the initial score
and soon added 2 markers when Solo-
mon, Tau Delt, was tagged for a
safety. Many chances were lost by
both teams, while Warden, Deke,
starred.

Phi Gamma Delta pulled the feature
surprise of the .day when they de-
feated Phi Kappa Psi to the tune of
18-6. The game was too fast for end
runs, all gains being made through
long passes. Bartlett stared for Phi
Gam while ist did likewise for Phi
Psi. The feature event was a touch-
down from a kick-off, the ball travel-
ing from Bartlett to Schuler to Bart-
lett to Taylor.

Delta Tau Delta fought to a score-
less tie with Delta Upsilon in each
team’s initial encounter of the season.
The teams were evenly matched and
there were no outstanding players or
plays. Both teams featured the in-
tercepting of their opponents’ passes.
Marshall, D. T. D., completed a 40
yard pass but the necessary punch to
score was lacking.

Yearling Swimmers
Urged To Report

Through the mistaken notion
that all freshmen must take two
quarters of graded gym many of
the yearlings who excel in swim-
ming and other year round sports
are losing much valuable practice.
Such a requirement does not exist
and freshmen who are interested
in athletics may change their gym
registration to practice in their fav-
orite sport.

Many expert swimmers entered
this fall but through the mistake
most of them instead of reporting
to Coach MacGillavry at the tank
signed up for graded gym. As a
result the Frosh squad is small and
not up to the usual standard. All
men who arc at all interested in
swimming and have fair skill are
urged to report to the coach in
Bartlett for team training. Swim-
ming is one of the minor sports at
the University and numerals are
awarded to each years team.

Gopher Team Holds
Short Drill Here

Minnesotta’s heavy football
squad acompanied by Coaches
“Doc” Spear and ‘Patsy’ Clark
stopped over in Chicago yesterday
morning and held a spirited work-
out on Stagg field before proceed-
ing to Ann Arbor, Mich., where
the team clashes with the Wolve-
rines Saturday.

With 46 men in uniform, Min-
nesota practiced kicking on the
Midway Field and later retired to
the Maroons’ practice field for a
dummy scrimmage.

The squad i sexceptionally heavy
and appeared confident of upset-
ting the dope bucket in Saturday’s
game.

For only a small part of the uni-
versity student body was aware of
the visitors’ ’presence on the Mid-
way and the squad was conse-
quently unmolested during its
workout.

BOWLING ALLEYS

OPEN FOR PLAY

With everything newly equipped
and the whole place more conveniently
arranged the bowling alleys were for-
mally re-opened last night. The Ath-
letic department, directed by Lonnie
Stagg, has put the alleys in up-to-date
shape and the ever popular sport is in
for another season’s big run. Although
the fact that the opening was to come
so soon was not generally known a
good crowd of enthusiasts was on
hand to try the new equipment last
night.

During the time that the alleys were
closed many new features were in-
stalled. In adition the alleys were
polished, the pin racks overhauled, and
new pins set up. Bill King is the
student manager of the enterprise and
his corps of assistants promise the
best of service from now henceforth.

FIGHTING MIDWAY
TEAM READY FOR
BIG GRID CLASSIC

Staggmen Are Underdog* In
Return Game With
Penn

By I. N. Cohen

Eleven fighting-mad Maroons, in-
culcated with that frenzied fury
usually found in the underdog will
trot out on Franklin Field in Phila-
delphia tomorrow to battle the power-
ful Pennsylvania eleven. In the Quak-
ers the Maroons face a team which is
the talk of the east and one which
entertains well-founded aspirations for
national honors this fall.

The easterners have ridden rough-
shod over the three opponents faced
to date, and in doing so have exhibited
a dazzling mixture of tricky line
smashes, wide sweeping end runs be-
hind solid interference, and a forward
pass attack reminiscent of the over-
head game displayed by Dartmouth
last year. In all their formations the
ball is cleverly concealed, and numer-
ous fakc-bucks and criss-crosses add
still more effectiveness to their offen-
sive.

Out to Avenge Defeat

The Maroons are speeding east to
avenge a 7-0 defeat suffered in Phil-
adelphia last fall, possessing for the
first time in several years something
besides a sturdy defense and a line
pulverizing attack. In their first two
games and in their practice sessions
the Maroons have given ample indica-
tions of possessing an exceedingly
versatile offensive. In past years it
was the practice of Chicago’^ oppon-
ents to use a “box” of secondary de-
fense to concentrate on stopping the
Maroon line crashes, no attention be-
ing paid to a defense against forward
passes. Should Coach Lou Young of
the Quakers exhibit a “box” defense

tomorrow afternoon, he will be
for an unpleasant surprise.

Against Florida and Maryland
Maroons exhibited nothing but

due

the

the

simplest types of formations. Against
Penn, however, Stagg will in' all
probability “shoot the entire works,”
Big Ten scouts to the contrary not-
withstanding.

Before entraining for the east yes-
terday the Maroons put the finishing
touches to several plays which have

been saved for the exclusive edifica-
tion of the Quakers.

The exact starting lineup for to-
morrow’s game is uncertain, but
thanks to the Messrs. Benson and Mo-
lander every man on the squad is in
perfect condition. The team will take
their final workout this afternoon at

the Manufacturers’ Club on the out-
skirts of the City of Brotherly Love.

According to the football intelleg-
entsia, Chicago’s chances for victory
tomorrow are practically null and void.
These folks forget to take into con-
sideration the tremendous psycholog-
ical advantage possessed by a Stagg-

coached eleven which is the underdog
and furthermore I seem to remetnber
something said by the experts a short
month ago regarding the certainty of
Mr. Dempsey’s annihilating this fel-
low Tunney in this very e#me Phila-
delphia.

Touchdown!

IT is unfortunate that the band has
had its uniforms changed just before
the Penn game. Now what will our
players have to make them fighting
mad?
