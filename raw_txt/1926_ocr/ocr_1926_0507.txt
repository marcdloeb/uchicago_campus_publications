UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, FRIDAY, MAY 7, 1926

SENIORS MAKE
FIRST PLEDGES

ON CLASS GIFT

Subscribed $6,507 at Chapel;
WiU Raise $20,000

By Convocation

$6,507 was raised yesterday among
148 members of the senior class, when
the first lap of a $20,000 memorial
drive to the late President Ernest De-
Witt Burton began at the weekly
chapel section.

Originated by the class of ’25, the
drive* will appropriate $20,000 from
each graduating class, to be raised by
voluntary donation, until the total of
$200,000 has been reached. This $200,-
000 will constitute a memorial fund,
the interest from which is to be util-
ized to endow a distinguished service
professorship. •

Distribute Pledge Blanks

While less than half the desired
quota was subscribed today, most of
the class took away with them pledge
cards, and the sum of $20,000 is ex-
pected to be reached by next Thurs-
day. Last year's graduating class
subscribed $21,000.

“Every member of the Senior class
is expected to do his share.” declared
Seward Covert, treasurer of the class,
in a plea before the chapel session. “No
matter how little—all that we ask is
something from every man and wom-
an. Those who can afford the most
are expected to give the most.

Expect Full Quota

“It is up to this class to establish
a successful link in the chain of years
will eventually have completed a great
memorial to President Burton.”

Opportunity to enhance to sum is
open to any member of the class from
now until convocation. Covert will
handle funds for the class and hopes
turn over to the funds a sum that will
set the mark for succeeding classes.

"The Senior Class gift is last trib-
ute of a graduating student to his alma
mater,” said Allen Miller last night.
“We believe that the class is begin-
ning to realize the sanctity and mean-
ing of the occasion.’’

Mrs. Merrill Lists Annual Social
Events to Avoid Conflict in Dates

In order to permit the equal distri-
bution of the social events -for next
year, Mrs. R. V. Merrill, director of
Social Activities, h« pc feted a chrrt
in her office, enumerating the more
important annual affair. This chart
contains the dates on which these
events fell in 1925-1926.

“Our aim?’ said Mrs. Merrill, “is
to arrange the events during next
year to avoid crowding nr concurrence

For example, this year the Mirror
play, the Spanish Fiesta, and the In-
tramural Athletic Carnival all occurred
on the same night, while no import-
ant social functions were schedul J
during many week-ends.”

At Mrs. Merrill’s request, a com-
mittee will be appointed by Wendell
Bennett, president of the Under *.•«,.!-
uate Council, to help her arrange ..ext
year’s sch' * . / -

president of the Chicago Theological
Seminary will perform the ceremony.

A spotless white altar, that for more
than half a century saw service in the
church of Miss Emmons’ great-great
grandfather, will figure in the wed-
ding. For it will be before this altar,
hewed from New England timber be-
fore the Revolutiony war, that the
t couple will exchange the marriage
vows.

The bride’s grand father was a not-
ed New England divine whose home
served as a theological seminary for
many years. Among his students were
many men who since have gone down
in history for their achievements.

The altar was a part of the Con-
gregationalist church exhibit at the
Chicago World’s Fair. Since the Fair,
it has been in the possession of the
Theological Seminary, and it now oc-

WOMEN DISCUSS
CLASSBEHAVIOR

Consider Attitudes of Faculty
And Students Both

“Classroom attitudes” is the subject
that has been chosen for discussion at
the open council meeting of Federa-
tion to be held Tuesday from 7 to 8
in the library of Ida Noyes hall. The
topic represents the aim of Federation
to choose appropriate and vital ques-
tions that are troubling students, to
discuss possible solutions, and to place
the solutions before organization that
can handle them.

Several members of the faculty have
been invited to join in the discussion.
They will present their ideas of class-
room courtesy, and discuss the ways
in which both sides fail to live up to
the accepted standards.

I. S. A. TO CHOOSE
NEXT YEAR’S HEADS

AT MEETING TODAY

International Students Association
will elect officers for the coming year
today at 8 in the Common room of
the new Theology building. The nom-
inating committee of the organization
met last week and have announced
the following list of candidates for
office:

For president, Raymond Oshimo
and William Pauck, vic‘-president;
•Mona Volkert, corresponding secre-
tary; Cha o-Ting Chi and Antonio
Rivera, recording secretary, Raina
Ivanhoe, and Alice Kinsman, and
treasurer, Leon Despres and Milque-
dex Ivanez.

Members desiring to make additional
nominations by petition have been re-
quested to send them to Lois G’Uand-
ers, a member of the committee, be-
fore noon today. Following the e;ec
tion today will be a social hour, inc’ud-
ing special music. “It is hoped that
all members will be present at the
meeting so that a representative vote
can be taken,” said Alice Kinsm * .
chairman of the publicit ycommittee.

S. H. Whiteside, Master Plumber
Explains the Cold Water at Ell

“The bubble fountain in East low-
er of Harper Library, ah, yes . . . .
the pride of the school,” said Sam
Whiteside, “deep in the bowels of
Harper,” he explained, “there are ice-
encased coils through which the "a-
ter flows. In the hottest of weather
this cooling process keeps the water
in the fountain cold as ice. Yes, you
sure can get your best drinks there.”

Ice-cold, chemical-free water in the

drinking fountain on the first floor of
East tower, Harper Library has long
been a subject of speculation for the
observing student. No matter how
foul the anemic water of Cobb hall
may be, or how hot the day, you can
always get a good drink at the little
fountain near E-ll.

So The Daily Maroon took upon it-
self to find out the cause of this
strange phenomenon. They called the
Master Plumber of the University.

EDUCATORS TO
GATHER TODAY
AT CONFERENCE

Conduct Scholarship Exams
for 500 High School

Students

Leading high school and academy

of Sociay Service Administration, and
another on “Direct Training of Char-
acter” by W. W. Charters, professor
of Education at Chicago. Departmen-
tal conferences will be held tomorrow.

Students who are attending the con-
ference and are taking examinations
both in the Gymnasium of Ida Noyes
hall and in Cobb 110 will be aided by
the Federation of University Women
and by Iron Mask. At present there
are 500 registrations for the competi-
tion which is 150 more than last year.

Station Sponsors

Federation will have an information

the Secondary Schools and the Uni-
versity will be discussed.

Breasted Arrives

In New York On

Way To Chicago

Prof. James H. Breasted, head of
the Oriental institute of the Univer-
sity of Chicago will return to this city
in about two weeks, a letter from the
Egyptologist received yesterday by
the University stated. Fatigued by
his extensive work in the Near East
as director of two important expedi-
tions and personal representative of
Mr. John D. Rockefeller in Egypt,
Prof. Breasted was advised by his
friends in New York to take a short
rest which delayed his return to the
University offices.

While in Egypt, Prof. Breasted
made his headquarters the Univer-
sity’s fine new building on the Nile.
From here he conducted the expedi-
tions along the banks of the river as
well as into the interior, and according
to reports received at the University
from time to time, a number of de-
cidedly significant discoveries reward-’
ed his excavations. As always, Prof.
Breasted is returning with many in-
teresting objects to add to the Uni-
versity’s collection.

His pieces of old statuary and archi-
tecture are famous in art galleries all
over America. He has spent his whole
career pursuing Egyptology. He has
a residence near the campus.

A COLLEGE AGORA

IT IS our custom in this column to point out from time to time the
* various evils which infest the campus, to record the faults of our

contemporaries, to enoumerate in detail the errors and inefficiencies
of the local life. It is even customary to cast a prophetic and millen-
nial eye upon the situation and explain how things should be done.
The time has come for another such impolite pointing of the editorial
finger.

We have it from those who know intimately the lives of our
busy Campus Activities Men that a good portion of Campus Activity
consists of dashing from one meeting place to another, and search-
ing for reports, records and constitutions which are uncertain of loca-
tion and improbable of existence. Thousands of foot-pounds of en-
ergy are lost every quarter because there is no central meeting place
reserved for the exclusive use of the various undergaduate bodies,
and because there is no coordinated system of filing by which the Ac-
tivities Men of one generation can utilize the cumulative experience
of their elders.

We propose that the Buildings and Grounds department solve
the difficulty. We propose that they provide an undergraduate
meeting room to be devoted wholly to the uses of such organizations
as the Undergraduate Council, the Honor Commission, the Marshals
and Aides, the various class councils, and the several undergraduate
boards. We propose further that these bodies keep accurate and
systematic records of all their undertakings so that the editors and
the hop leaders and the settlement night workers and the cheerlead-
ers and the presidents of the future may profit by this year’s suc-
cesses and this year’s errors.

Such a meeting place could easily become the focusing point of
all undergraduate activity, a market for the exchange of suggestions
and criticisms. Such a filing system would readily become an inval-
uable magazine of high-powered information. The haphazard dif-
fusion of the present would be avoided. And the Activities Men
could save their wrinkled brows for their books......

Phoenix Looks for
Mysterious Artist

Fred Handschy and his Phoenix
staff are thinking some of turning
the University comic publication into
a mystery magazine. Last month it
was, “Guess who the girl on the cov-
er is.” This month it is “Who sub-
mitted the drawing for the cover?”

But not even Handschy knows
who the mysterious artist is. It
seems that when Fred came into the
office one morning there was a bea-
tiful picture lying on the floor. Some
one had evidently slipped it under
the door and run. But though he
looked on both sides several times,
he was unable to find any mark of
identification.

However the unfailing eyes of the
Photnix staff would not accept the
picture because of the delicate colors
on it, which would be hard to repro-
due. They chose instead a cover
submitted by Langdon Caldwell Dew-
ey.

EL CIRCULO PLANS
SPANISH DINNER AT

DOMINGO SOLER’S

A Spanish dinner has been planned
by El Circulo Espanol for Wednesday
at 7:30 at Domingo Soler’s restaurant
located at 17 North Robey Street. The
proprietor of the restaurant is Span-
ish and makes a specialty of typical
dishes, popular in all Spanish-speaking
countries. The dishes he prepares are
palatable to Americans in spite of the
current misconception of Spanish food
as being highly seasoned and over
spicy, according to Yolanda Simiz,
president of the club.

Tickets for the dinner may be ob-
tained at Ida Noyes hall for one dol-
lar a plate. As the dinner has been
planned for the benefit of all those
interested in Spanish cuisine, these tic-
kets have not been limited to members
of the club.

PURDUE, MAROON MEET ON CINDERS

DELT, TAU SIGS,
DELTA CHI, D. U.

WIN I-M BATTLES

Delta Chi Nine Shows Class
In 20 to 4
Victory

The games for today:

Phi Kappa Psi vs. Phi Beta Delta
Sigma Chi vs. Chi Psi.

Phi Gamma Delta vs. Sigma Nu.

Kappa Nu vs. Delta Tau Delta

Tau Sigma Omricon vs. Alpha Del-
ta Phi

Swinging their bats with lusty aban-
don the Delta Chi ball players piled
up the biggest score of the day when
they buried the Tau Delta Phi outfit
under a 20 to 4 count. I nthe other
games Delta Tau Delta defeated Beta
Theta Pi 9 to 7; Tau Sigma Omicron
licked the Pi Lambda Phi team 6-3;
and Delta Upsilon took the measure
of lambda Chi Alpha 12-6.

The Delta Chi's did al! their busi-
ness in three big innings, the first, fifth
and seventh. They concentrated their
strength on their attack which was all
that could be asked for. Johnson,
with a triple and homer, and Ellis,
freshman golf sensation, played bang-
up ball for the victors. The one-sided-
ness of the game detracted from its in-
terest.

D. U.’s Win

The D. U.’s were rarely in trouble
in their game with Lambda Chi Al-
pha. It was a hitting battle from the
outset with the victors socking the ball
the farthest. Clarke poled out three
safe bingles in as many times up while
Keller for the losers did as well.

A spirited rally in the closing chap-
ters by the Beta Theta Pi was not
enough to win from the Delta Tait’s
who had practically sewed-up the game
in the early innings. / The losers
showed fairly strong team play, with
no one scintillating but the Delta Tau’s
were too steady’ in the field while
Hack’s hefty slugging was the back-
bone of the attack.

Good Fielding Game

Both the T. S. O.’s and Lambda
Phi’s were strong in the field but good
pitching kept the score down. The
winners practically put the game on
th eice when they counted four times
in the third. Bits of sparkling fielding
contributed to keeping this advantage
secure. Cohen whaled out a home-
run in the last inning.

GOLFERS ENGAGE

HAWKEYES TODAY

Open Big Ten Season At
Olympia

Iowa golfers are scheduled for their
first invasion of Chicago’s territory
this afternoon. The Hawkeyes boast
of a strong quartet in the Scotch past-
time, but they are at a disadvantage
with the matches holding sway on for-
eign soil. Nevertheless, the hoys from
out-state want to keep up with the
pace set by their tennis team—perhaps
they will be disappointed for Captain
Hisert is not easily subdued, and the
others have also been driving and put-
ting in grand style.

Hisert with Patterson, Dorsey and

Bartlett has been practicing on the
battle grounds of Olympia Field dur-
ing the past week. All four men
know’ the course well, which goes a
long way in determining results. While
the golfers from the corn belt state
were looking up train schedules, the
campus men were looking for flaws
and obstacles in fairways and greens
of Olympia. low'a has been weak in
this department of athletics in former
years.

The tourney will include both in-
dividual and team play. Chicago is
expected to cop honors in the individ-
ual events.

In an effort to encourage the spread-
ing interest in fencing, a sport that is
fast taking a firm hold in the Chicago
high schools, the University will hold
its fourth annual fencing meet on Sat-
urday evening. Bartlett gymnasium
will be the scene of the even. The
floor of the gym will be set with mats
and runways for the most efficient
carrying on of the bouts.

MAROON TENNIS

TEAM IS CHOSEN
BY COACH REED

Capt.~ Schaeffer, Hudlin,
And Shapinsky
Form Nucleus

The meet will be open to all of the

amateurs in Chicago and its near vi-
cinity. There will be bouts in the
novice, junior, and senior classes in
foils, sabres and duelling swords open
to all. A special feature of the meet-
ing will be a foils competition for
women. There are many’ foils experts
among the feminine athletes of the
city and it is felt that there will be
a large entry in the particular event.

Entries Are Numerous

Engraved ribbons will be awarded

as prizes to winners of the first .sec-
ond and third places of each event.
No entry fee will be charged and an
extension of the time limit gives the
competitors until 7:30. just before the
events start, to hand in their names.

It is expected that there will be a
large attendance and entry list from
each of the eleven city high schools
which have fencing on their program,
as well as from the various schools
of the University. A number of athlet-
ic clubs, such as the Illinois Fencers’
League, are planning to make team
entries.

The fencers are divided into the
three classes according to the experi-
ence that they have had.

Doc Reed has made the final cuts
in his squad—the varsity has claimed
its men. Captain Schaeffer, Hudlin,
Shapinsky, Hall. Marumoto. Bennett.
Cohn, Drain and Plaut will defend the
Maroon racket-honors of this season.

Having been beaten by Iowa last
Monday, the men are ready to make
amends by defeating the Ulini squad,
which was also mowred down by the
relentless Haw'keyes. Captain Wallie
Schaeffer with Hudlin and Shapinsky
will keep the balls hopping at the*
Champaign courts Saturday afternoon.
Wallie’s game has improved during
this last week, and all his strokes hav-
ing been gone over, he is ready to
face the fast Orange and Blue swing-
ers. Hudlin, National colored chan.p,
has at last perfected a cut style of
play—really the ball does no more
than loll. In both doubles and sing-
gles play, Shapinsky, last year’s intro-
mural champion, shows consistency in
returning difficult shots.

Doc. Reed who is coaching the. team
is expecting a hard fought match and
is not yet sure of his combination
of players for the double contests.

WEEK’S SETBACKS

Squads Evenly Matched;
Cusack To Meet
Little

By Bob Stern

A real affair along track lines is the
promise for tomorrow' when Maroons
and Boilermakers meet in their dual
meet at Lafayette. The Maroon team
w’ill put a bloody battle to regain the
prestige that was lost in the Indiana
upset and the Purdue outfit will fight
for a win to salve the smart left by
their defeat at the hands of the North-
western squad last Saturday.

Spencer of the Lafayette crew is
hailed as a genuine sprint star. He won
both the 100 and the 220 dash events
against the Purple and has already
beat the Chicago dash-men in one in-
door start. Harmon, of last fall’s foot-
ball fame, is another dangerous man
in the short distances.

Heart Throbs and Thrills

When I came into the room the
girls were just getting ready for bed.
Two of them were sitting on the bed,
the other one was taking off her shoes.
I began to think that after all perhaps
this was not the time for me to have
returned. They were extremely beau-
tiful girls .... all three of them.
One of them was a very blond young
person and the other two were brun-
ettes. Three young Aphrodites. They
sat before me, and while still fully
clothed, indications were that they
would not remain that way for long.
I repeat that this was an extremely
embarassing position for a young man
to be in. What did I do? Why the
only thing that a decent young fel-
low would do .... I pulled down
the shade in my room and went to
sleep.
