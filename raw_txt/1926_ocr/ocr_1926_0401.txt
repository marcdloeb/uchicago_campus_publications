Because of the eleven baskets he

and Houbert indulged in several bits of

A novel and ingenius use for

will eventually prove very profit-

The other day one of the visit-
ing players from the other side of
the Mississippi was walking down
57th street when his cowboy hat
became mixed up with the wind
and was blown off. Very indig-

Here Are the Results and Box Scores

of the Second Day’s

High scores characterized
games of yesterday morning

afternoon, when the first of

the large number of points,
the games were close and
of them were hair-raisers.

from the big outdoors, went a step
the farther in the national interschol-
and astic when they defeated Oak Ridge,
sec- Louisiana, by a score of 28 to 19 in

spite of a hard fought encounter. The Da-

most of
several

Salem, Roswell, Fitchburg, Wheel-
er, and Nanticoke were high scorers
in these games, all of them getting
over thirty points. Wheeler, the
Mississippi dark horse of last year’s
tourney, showed they have lost none
of their basket-shooting prowess, by
taking high-point honors in defeat-
ing Reno, Nevada, 46 to 13.

Salem defeated Danville 37 to 11,
Roswell nosed out Hagerstown by a
35 to 30 count, Fitchberg beat Bill-
ings in a 32 to 20 game, and Nanti-
coke won over Salt Lake City, Utah,
39 to 26.

The closest of all was the Gaylord
(Minnesota)-Memphis contest, which
ended in a 24 to 23 victory for the
Northerners. Another nip-and-tuck
battle was the Atlanta win over the
popular Omaha quintet by a 22 to
16 score.

kotans sarted off with a rush, but the
southerners got sarted and the game
was on an even basis until the be-
ginning of the third quarter when
the Fargo five started a scoring orgy
which quickly cinched the game.

They are a veteran outfit and prom-

tions the campus was not agog with
excitement, and no cheering groups
of students were seen, the most note-
worthy and happy event took place
yesterday in the cloistered precincts
of Stagg Field. Plans for the stadium
have long been in the negotiation
process and yesterday the workmen
quietly started actually to bring
them into reality.

Thus the fans are assured of a
football stand for Chicago that will
seat between forty-five and fifty
thousand people when next fall’s
football games come due. Within
two weeks steam shovels will be at
work digging the foundations for the
great structure that will eventually
bring the seating capacity of Stagg
Field to over seventy thousand.

The main floor with over seventy
tiers of seats, holding upwards of
seventeen thousand people will be
finished by next fall so that Chicago
fans, for the first time in many
years, may look forward to seeing
the Maroons in action against such
teams as Illinois, Ohio State and
Wisconsin whose games in recent
years have been open only to a
lucky few. The field will be changed
to run north and south and the pre-
sent stand which was originally built
to seat but thirty thousand specta-
tors will become an end bleacher.

The new stand will be 440 feet
long, over 150 feet deep and with a
huge wall running the entire length

Salem High of Salem, South Da-
kota, has one of the most remark-1
able records of any team in the tour-
ney. The conquerors of the Ken- ।
tucky title-holders have registered 36
consecutive victories and have yet to
taste defeat. The green clad boys
have scored 1,200 points to their op-
ponents 400 points.

The South Dakotans boast one of
the tightest five man defenses seen
here in years, reminding one of the
famous Yankton, S. D., defense two
years ago. Every man on the team
is a dead eye and they rely on short
pass attack for victory. Every man
except one was here last year and
they have taken on lots of weight and
experience which bodes ill for their
opponents.

Subs Not Rooters

Says Texas Editor

The Sports Editor of the Brack-
enridge High School “Times” who
filled a guard berth on the Ranger
team in today’s game, managed
also to find time to mix the com-
mas with the dribbles and the fol-
lowing paragraphs form a part of
the write-up which he sent to the
school paper. How the Maroon
reporter managed to filch the
copy is no one’s business, suffice
to say he did it.

“No team can win without
strong reserves” says John Mc-
Graw, manager of the New York
Giants. This was proved in the
first game of the National Tour-
nament when three regulars of
the Texas team were put out for
excessive fouling. The three subs
went in and played just as good
a game as the regulars and they
were sent in when the game was
tied.

Many people have the impres-
sion that a basketball team is com-
posed of five players and some
uniformed rooters who do nothing
but model for the fans. The subs
not only must be ready to go in
any minute if a regular gets “piti-
ful” or hurt; but they also put the
team in shape by furnishing com-
petition.

Newton’s powerful quintet showed un-
mistakable championship form when
they smothered the Lexington five, them-
selves more than ordinarily rugged, by
a 36 to 19 score. The team from the
state where men are men and high
school boys are also made the most pre-
sentable showing of the day’s play. The
score at the end of the first half was 13
to 6 with the winners in the lead, but the
next half the Kansas boys tossed them
in from all corners of the floor and the
center.

and wide enough to be used for bas-
ketball and other intramural sports.
The interior of the stand has been
carefully designed to allow for an
eight lap cinder track which will be
used until the completion of the new
field house. * On account of the build-
ing of the stadium work on the field
house has been delayed.

“The double-decking of the new
stadium would be physically impos-
sible for next fall,” according to Wil-
liam Scott Bond, chairman of the
stadium committee. “Plans for fut-
ure construction will be made after
the 1926 gridiron season.”

DEAN SMALL: AN APPRECIATION

By Frederic J. Gurney

A LBION W. SMALL was one of the finest spirits that ever graced
■^ * the University, or any other institution. A manly man, a genial,
cheery, helpful friend, a great scholar, an inspiring teacher, one of
the makers of Sociology as a science, he built himself into the Uni-
versity in its formative years and into the intellectual and spiritual
life of everyone who studied under him. More than that, he touched
with kindliness and helpful cheer every one with whom he came in
contact. He met you on the level and you could not help seeing
that he really desired to make life pleasant for you. High and low
were alike human to him. Many years ago a letter carrier who had
been delivering mail at the University for a long time was detected

opening letters and was sentenced to two years imprisonment,
case was followed with general interest here because he was
known and was pleasant and obliging in manner. When his
tence had been announced, Dean Small said, “Now when his

The
well
sen-
time

is up we must all get around him and help him onto his feet again.”

Great scholar and investigator as he was. Dean Small’s primary
interest was in human beings. Great teacher as he was he taught not a
subject but people. His perception of the moral issues of any situa-
tion was unerring and his attitude with regard to principles was abso-
lutely uncompromising, but his aim was to make people see the right
and help them to do it. And a thing that made contact with him
especially delightful was a delicious humor of a kind all his own,
which bubbled up so frequently in the midst of conversation and
often in more serious discourse. One could not help loving him.

The writer of these few lines is very keenly aware that they are
quite inadequate as an appreciation of Dean Small, but they are
written out of deep admiration and affection that have grown up
during many years of association, mostly casual, in the course of
daily work. It would need someone with the rich and abundant
eloquence and the clear and forceful expression of thought of which
he himself was master, to do anything like justice to the theme. The
feelings of many friends may well be expressed in the words of a
member of the office of the Deans of the Graduate Schools who had
been with him many years, “What a smiling memory he has left
behind him.”

ANXIOUS

A NEW question in etiquette has bothered us since
Perhaps you can help us.

W’e were the only member of our 1 1 -o’clock class,
or perhaps the rain, kept everybody else (except the

yesterday.

The snow,
professor)

away. W'e took our seat, and the professor stood before us. “Let
us consider this morning,” he began, “the effect of the Thirty Years’
war on German nationalism.”

“All right, sir,” said we. “An excellent idea.” This seemed the
thing to say. We had to say something: that was clear enough.
Hadn’t the man been talking to us? In fact, was there ony one else
to whom he could have been talking? So we said, “All right, sir;
an excellent idea.”

He continued. So did we. Whenever he paused, we put in an
appropriate “Yes, sir,” or “No, sir,” or “To be sure,” or “Why
not?”

But presently we began to wonder. Was the man really talking ।
to us? He looked at us now and then, it is true; but he looked just
as often at the empty chairs about us. He ignored our brief com-
ments, and talked ahead as if we had said nothing at all. This was
no conversation; this was a lecture. Our professor would have said
the same things, if thirty students had sat before him. And our
“Yes, sir,” and “That's right, sir,” were interruptions; they were'
just as impolite as if we had said them in the midst of thirty stu-
dents. They were more impolite, in fact.

We said nothing more. Sure enough, the professor continued as
before. We were right. This was, as we had suspected, a lecture.
We opened our notebook, and wrote—wrote fast, to make up the
time we had lost.

There is a cycle of fashion

Appointment Only Tempor-
ary; New Dean to be
Named Later

Prof. Chauncey Samuel Boucher,
associate dean of the colleges of Arts,
Literature, and Science since 1923,
has been appointed to the adminis-
trative office just left vacant by Dr.
Ernest Hatch Wilkins.

Following in the train of Dr. Wil-
kins’ recent illness and consequent
resignation, Dean Boucher has held
the position for the past four months.
When Dr. Wilkins announced his for-
mal resignation, taking effect at noon
yesterday, the administration made
formal announcement of his suc-
cessor.

Appointment Only Pro Tern

According to Dean Boucher, he will
hold the position only until the end
of the quarter, after which a man
will be appointed for the executive
duties. The dean declares that he
has no intention of holding the office
permanently.

Chauncey S. Boucher hails from
the Wolverine state. He received his
A.B. degree from the University of
Michigan in 1909. In 1910 he won
his Master’s degree at the same
school, when he became a member of
his Alma Mater’s faculty, as instruc-
tor in history. In 1914, Dean Bouch-
er took his Ph.D., and left Michigan
for Washington university, where he
held the position of associate profes-
sor of history, from 1914 to 1919.
During the next year he taught the
same subject at Ohio State univer-
sity.

Boucher a Texas Graduate

Dr. Boucher won the office of full
professorship of American history at
the University of Texas. In 1923 the
Badger school claimed his prowess,
but after spending only a year there
he came to the University, where he
became professor of American his-
tory. A short time later Dean
Boucher was appointed assistant to
Dean Wilkins.

Among the dean’s honorary prizes
is a Fellowship in the Royal Histori-
cal Society, a distinction of the high-
est rank.

he and the other officials have noticed
particularly this year the universal feel-
ing of good fellowship and goodwill
found not only between the players, but
on the part of the observers in the
bleachers. All of the undergraduate
groups are co-operating to make the oc-
casion worthy of its participants.

In striking contrast to this friendly
feeling between the onlookers and the
players there is the occasional howling
and hissing of the officials from people
on the balcony. It is not the Chicago
group which lends the volume to this
exhibition of poor sportsmanship, but a
group of Chicago people with small bets
on the various teams. The very fact that
there was no response on the part of the
howlers to Mr. Stagg’s appeal made last
night proves that there are no college
students among this group.

PLAN JIYO PLAY FOR
UNIQUE JAPAN NIGHT

Japanese customs, manners, cul-
ture, and amusements will be pre-
sented to the University April 9,
when the Japanese students of the
University give Japan night at Ida
Noyes hall. A Jiyo play, a comedy of
Japanese life, will be the chief at-
traction of the evening.

The eiquette of the tea serving

Spring vacation witnessed a com-
plete reconstruction and consolida-
tion of the library books dealing with
the Theological department. With
the exception of a few books on
Greek and Roman religion that are
still in the Classics library, all the
Theological books in the University
libraries are now located in the new
Theological library on the third floor
of the Theology building.

This new departmental library,
consisting only of books on religion,
is tht largest and most complete
Theology library of any college in
the country. Although others may
contain more books, there is none as
large that contains only books on
Theology, according to Miss Grace
D. Philips, chief librarian of the
Theology library.

New Library Is Beautiful

The reading room is very spacious
and beautifully carved, covered by a
dome that reflects light on a multi-
tude of angles carved in the im-
mense oak supports. Two floors of
fire-proof stacks are also well
equipped with private tables for
graduate students. Before each win-
dow in these rooms of steel and con-
crete construction are desks fitted
out with shelves for books.

Two-thirds of the books in this
library have been reclassified accord-
ing to the Congress system of call
numbers, while the rest are still
located by the Dewey decimal system
of older origin.

Finding that the old date conflicted
with another social affair on the cam-
pus, the Military Department
has changed the date of the annual
Military Ball to April 23. The old
date was April 16. The annual
promenade will be held at South Shore
Country club.

Mayer Sick

Herbert Mayer, who is to lead one
wing of the opening promenade, has
been ill in the hospital but has now
returned to the campus and prepar-
ations for the affair are continuing.
Hugh Wilson is the other leader. The
two men are expected to announce
their partners within the next few
days.

Consider Chapman

The orchestra has not yet been en-
gaged, but the leaders are consider-
ing Jack Chapman, Husk O’Hare and
Ralph Williams. Their selection will
be announced in an early issue of
The Daily Maroon.

As was customary in the past, all
the military men that attend the
dance will be in full dress uniform.

sure out of Camels than
any other cigarette.

So this fair spring day
as a redoubtable batter
lofts out one that it seems
will never stop flying—
oh, then, taste the smoke
that means completed
enchantment.

Have a Camel!

WHEN the first ball game
is here. And the heavy
hitter cracks the ball
shrieking into deep cen-
ter for a home run —
have a Camel!

We laughed aloud at women

When they started wearing slickers;

We thought our sides would split

We men must rise to sing.

These women folk were rot so dumb
In getting furs for spring!
