Coach Praises New System
Inaugurated For Last
Meet

Tom Maloy was appointed Student
Manager of the twenty-second an-
nual National Interscholastic Track
and Field meet yesterday by Coach
A. A. Stagg on account of the inelig-
ibility of Stewart Lytle.

Mulroy was manager of the meet
last year and it was his success at
that time that secured his reappoint-
ment. The new plan of organizaion
that he devised and executed made
the Track Interscholhstic the best in
the hisory of the University, Mr.
Stagg stated. “Mulroy originated a
new plan of organization for the In-
terscholastic Commission that proved
most advantageous. That is one rea-
son for his appointment, for we wish
to carry it out further and to estab-
lish it firmly.”

Appoint Senior Manager

The new plan that is being incor-
porated will establish a senior as
manager in place of the junior as in
years previous to last. Under the
senior will be three juniors who held
sophomore positions the year before
and who will be at the head of the
three departments. Sophomores will
be in competition for the junior jobs
and freshmen will also compete. Thus
every man who obtains a responsible
position will have had experience in
running the meet and will be quali-
fied for his job.

PREDICTS VINECLAD
CHAPEL FOR 1971

cred the new Theology building
and Bond chapel by noonday on
.lune 16, 1971. This fact was as-
certained late last night after a
thorough mathematical process had
been exploited by campus scient-
ists.

The facts upon which the discov-
ery were made are as follows:
Cobh hall, oldest building in the
University, was built in 1892. V mes
were planted around its four walls
at that time. After thirty-four
years they have covered three-
fourths of its surface. Thus it has
been accurately figured out that
in forty-five and one-half years the
entire quadrangle group, with the
possible exception the new chapel
on the corner of Woodlawn avenue
and the Midway, will be vineclad.

Neglected Girls

Seek Pointers in
“Blonde” Book

Do gentlemen prefer blondes?

Titian didn’t, but Anita Loos says
they should if they don’t. And now,
campus women are becoming curi-
ous, if the circulation of Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes at the rental library
is indicative of a trend of feminine
interest.

Within the past month, the little
book that gives away the big secret
has been called for by twice as many
women as men students, according to
the librarrian. Some are attracted
by the title; others have hoard of the

content, but
why blonde

committee is composed of Graeme

They are attempting to eliminate
the discord resulting from quick
pledging as evidenced by the many
broken pledges each year. Last year,
there were fourteen men released
from their pledges; this year, so far,
twenty different fraternities have re-
leased twenty-nine men; an increase
of over one hundred per cent. The
general attitude of the University
has been toward a deferred system,
part of which was adopted this year.

located at 5749 Woodlawn avenue.

While the Boys took possession of
their house on April 1, cleaning, dec-

has necessitated closed doors, keep-

the house.

Invitations have been sent to all

open organizations, and a general in-
vite is extended to the entire campus
through The Daily Maroon.

President and Mrs. Max Mason and
other officers of the administration
are expected at the tea, which begins
about 3 o’clock.

The new Zeta Bete home is said to
be one of the most distinctive on
campus. It was purchased by the
Greeks from Dr. Milton K. Portis,
who has gone gone with his family to
Europe.

Spurs’. We must wear our spurs!
is the cry of revolt rising from the
military science department today.
For the edict has gone forth from
the Major’s office that spurs must be
parked tonight in the check room at
the South Shore Country club, at
least while the cadets are held en-
thralled by the merry-mad music-
pouring forth from. Coon Sander’s
band.

Memories of last year’s ball with
respect to torn stockings, scratched
boots, and ripped trousers, all on ac-
count of those delightful horseman’s
ornaments that the, cadets affect
form the basis for the much-discussed
order. Coming from headquarters,
however, the order must be obeyed,
and the cadets will promenade
through the South Shore spurless.

PREP WRESTLING
TOURNEY STARTS

THIS AFTERNOON

First Annual Cook County
Meet Gets Under Way

At Bartlett Gym

This afternoon at 2 o’clock nine
high schools compete at Bartlett in
the first round for the wrestling
championship of Cook county. Coach
Vorres’ tourney crew will get into
action and the prep wrestlers will go
to it. Several suburban schools, led
by New Trier, and Several of the
city’s most prominent high schools
will have teams in the field and the
competition will be keen.

Seventy-five of the prep athletes
are entered for the drawings. Mr.
Delaporte will do that necessary func-
tion this morning just before the big
event. Most of the grapplers are
experts, although all are amateurs
and they promise to stage some fast
matches. All of the bouts will be
under the decisions of head referee
J. G. Kallas of the University of
Illinois.

Harrison appeare to be the strong-
est with twelve men entered, while
Crane, Tilden and Lindblom are sec-
ond on the list of team strength with
nine entries apiece. Tilden is mak-
ing an especially strong bid for hon-
ors. The school has entered two men
who won firsts in the 145 and 125
pound classes of the city meet, two
men who took seconds, and two men
who captured thirds. Many of the
other city individual bout champs
are also entered.

Burg Sets Records

In Track and Study

Foggy bookworms have long
cried out that athletes are men-
tally weaklings and there has
has been little to say against their
accusations—but today, Lo and
Behold, a champion has entered ■
the lists against them. Anton I
Burg, Big Ten indoor high jump
champion, winner of that event
at the Illinois relay carnival and
holder of several other sport
titles has received only two marks
j below' “A” since he has been at
j the University. And both of I
those were “A minus’s.”

Burg is a junior in the science
chool and a sure Phi Beta Kappa
selection at the end of this quar-
ter. His record is 142 grade
points out of a possgible 144;
and yet it seems to be no hard
stunt for him to mix leaps of six
। feet three inches in with his col-
lection of “A’s.”

smotth as velvet and the fair ways I
rough enough to encourage the de-1
velopment of "Jack Hutchinsons.”

co-managers of the tourney and proph-
esize an interesting outcome. “The
entries are numerous, and many golf-
ers of prominence are to be in the

NORGRENITES JOURNEY TO IOWA

CITY; ROTH TEAMS STRIVE TO
RETRIEVE EARLY SEASON LOSSES

.	-------

Gubbins To Hurl For Maroons, Corbin For Hawkeye; Local
Lineup May Be Shifted; Thirteen
Men Make Trip

By Irving Goodman

Completely thawed out. after a few
j frigid early season setbacks, the Ma-
roons depart tonight for Iowa City
to tackle Iowa, coached by the ex-
Cub, Otto Vogel. The same thirteen
men that mad ethe trip to Lafayette
will journey to the Hawkeye -camp.

The lowans are still smarting over
the 11 to 4 beating handed them by
Illinois and are out for blood. Vogel
has been working his men overtime
to get them in shape for the Maroon
invasion. Corbin, star sophomore
hurler will pitch for th eCornhuskers
I with Miller behind the bat. Capt.
Flinn, Terry, and W. Miller will work
in the outfield. Vogel will use Smith
I at third. Gamble at the keystone sack,
McNabb, a newcomer at short, and
I Hoben at first base.

May Shift Line Up

Norgren will rely on Capt. Joie
Gubbins to stop the Iowa sluggers.
There is a possibility that Hoerger
may make the trip if he feels better,
j and if so he will greatly increase the
Maroon batting attack. The infield
I may be switched so that Price will
I cover the first sack while Bill Mack-
find will be shifted to the outfield.
Lurie and Marks will occupy the other
garden posts.

The weak hitting of the team which
1 has been causing Norgren much wor-

ry, should be improved after a week
of intensive batting practice. Brig-
nall and Macklind have been clouting
the ball far and hard in practice, while
Tex Gordon has also shown some of
the clean hitting that made him the
most feared, batter on last year’s frosh
squad.

Gubbins Improves

Gubbins who has been wild in his
early starts should be in top form.
If |he w'ee southpaw is right he
should have little difficulty in making
the Hawks break their backs trying
to hit his deceiving slow and curve
balls. If Gubbins is not up to his
regular form, Marks or Macklind will
be ready to step in from the outfield
and deliver th epill.
