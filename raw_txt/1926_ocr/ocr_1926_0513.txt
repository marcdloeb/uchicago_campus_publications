entire city of Chicago, including a
tour of the stock yards, banquets,
fraternity entertainment, a Senior
Vaudeville, a moonlight dance, and
last but not the least, a World’s

program planned for the visiting
prep school athletes that will com-
pete in the twenty-second annual In-
terscholastic track and field meet to
he held on Soldier’s field June 4
and 5.

At a luncheon of the Interscholas-

outlined and plans definitely laid to
carry on the greatest rushing sched-

The athletes will be met at the

committee and by the fraternity rep-
resentatives that were named last
Tuesday to supplement the regular
commission. From the train the com-
petitors will be transported to the
registration booth in Bartlett Gym-
nasium where credentials will be re-
ceived.

Under the tutelage of the recep- i
tion committee, the visitors will be ।

will be taken on a tour through the
city in busses and private motors.
Field Museum, the stock yards, and
Sears, Roebuck and Co., will be thor-

as they arc the famed and well-
known attractions of Chicago.

Preliminaries will be run off Fri-

all. of the contestants after the meet,
at which Coach Stagg, Crisler and

CUSACK APPOINTS 12
RUSHING ASSISTANTS

Jack Cusack, chairman of the cor-
respondent rushing committee of the
national Interscholastic track and
field meet, has announced the mem-
bers of his committee.

His assistants are: Fred Coulter,
Hairy Ault, Tom Budlong, Joe Mc-
Carthy, Robert Place. Rudolph Coles,
Wayne Cassel, Randolph Alford,
Frank Pollard, Wakefield Burke,
Henry Losch and Cornelius Oker.

The committee expects every stu-
dent of the University, who is inter-
ested in the Interscholastic, to give
the names of the stars of his high
school, or of schools in the vicinity
to it. Cusack says, “It is only
through the efforts of the entire stu-
dent body that the success of the
committee may be insured.

If you have any' names of out-
standing athletes in mind get in
touch with Cusack at the Phi Kappa
Psi house, and the committee insures
that every one will receive an invi-
tation.

grey hairs. The great Neff, after
thoroughly inspecting his appear-
ance, announced, with much gusto
and satisfaction, that he would al-

with his transparent specialty, is
at present undecided. “Bus” Stev-

Most morgues have a certain un-
pleasant connotation. In fact, most
morgues are the least cheerful places
in the world. But not so the Ma-
roon Morgue.

It was conceived in the Newswrit-
ing class of Mr. Frank H. O’Hara
by no less person than Mr. O’Hara
himself.

“Wouldn’t it be nice,” said Mr.
O'Hara, “to have within reaching dis-
tance, all the facts about all the im-
portant persons in the University?
Then, in case one of them should
suddenly leave on an Arctic expedi-
tion, or a balloon race, so suddenly
that he could not be interviewed, all
the reporter would need to do would
be to reach to the files, get out all
the jfacts about the person, and
there would be the story.”

The Maroon staff, seated in the
front row, sighed in agreement. A
morgue, a newspaper morgue, a file
of biographical facts of important

people, which is considered indis-

| pensable on every newspaper, is but

office.

“Well,” said Mr.

ENTERTAIN GUESTS

Classical clubs from nine local
high schools will be entertained by
Eta Sigma Phi, classical cluh of the
University, today at 4 :30 in Classics
20. The program for the meeting
has been planned to show the high
school students the human and hu-
morous side of classic literature. Two
of the idyls of Theocritus and a
mime of Herod us will be given to
show that the chatter of women and
the tricks of school boys have re-
mained the same during the last
2500 years.

On Friday afternoon Eta Sigma

nine universities who are attending
the second annual national conven-
tion at Northwestern Friday, May
14 and Saturday, May 15. Margaret

Ellen Hartman, Charlotte Eckhart,
Evelyn Oakes, Betty Graham, Agnes
Dunham, Jane Cook, and Joanna
Downs.

“We are out to show the men that
their responsibility is no greater than
ours,” said Miss Fitzgerald. “I have
chosen a group of representative
campus women who I think can give
the visitors a good impression of the
University.”

Smith to Speak at

Members of the Sociology club
will dine together tonight at 6:30 in

Concept ‘Work’ in Social Philosophy”.
After the talk an informal discussion
will be held by members of the
club.

Tickets for the dinner may be ob-
tained by members of the club and
their guests for seventy-five cents
from F. F. Stephen, president of the
organization, and from W. C. Ben-

Latest investigation of the May
issue of the Phoenix which appears
today, would seem to indicate that

the issue, according to Fred Har.d-

Bill Hahn's seven-piece “College

William Weddell was elected head
cheerleader for next year by the Un-
dergraduate Council yesterday after-
noon. John Gerhart became assistant
cheerleader, and Stewart McMullen,
Mundy Peale, Arthur Collat, and
Harry Ingwersen became sophomore
assistants.

Weddell and Gerhart will both be
juniors next year. Ordinarily the
head cheerleader of the University,
is a senior, but Weddell was chosen
because of his outstanding ability.
Weddell has been elected for one
year only, so that the job will be
thrown open to competition again in
his senior year. Gerhart is to remain
on the staff in the meantime.

Name Sophs

The staff of four elected to serve
as sophomore assistants next year will
probably be increased by any new
material that is discovered, accord-
ing to Seward Covert, former head
cheerleader of the University. The
four already elected are the only ones
that have done enough work and have
been consistent enough to gain the
distinction, according to Covert.

Said Wendell Bennett, president
of the Undergraduate Council, yes-
terday afternoon: ‘This action of the
Council must not be considered. as
having established a precedent. We
elected Weddell because we did not
think any of the junior aspirants sat-
isfactory and because he seemed to
be the best man available.- At. the
same time, we did not wish to force
Gerhart out of competition. Hence
Weddell’s one year term. The new
stadium complicates the cheerleading
question immensely and makes the
task of stimulating the team and
leading the spectators doubly diffi-
cult. It is therefore absolutely nec-
essary that the head cheerleader be
an altogether competent man. Wed-
dell will be in charge of all Univer-
sity pep sessions.”

Uniform* Same

Weddell will wear the read coat
of the head cheerleader next year,
while Gerhart, his associate, will as-
sume the equally famous white sweat-
er. This has been done to empha-
size the fact that the men are both
eligible for the position of head
cheerleader in their senior year. The
four assistants will be dressed in the
usual red shirts and white trousers.

“Both these men have an unusual-
ly heavy responsibility resting on
them for next year,” said Bennett,
“inasmuch as they are confronting
a new and untried stadium and be-
cause their service during their se-
nior year will depend on the record
they make under these conditions.”

CHAPTER FOR A FRESHMAN ENGLISH TEXTBOOK

IITHEN you write, you must make your reader understand you.

According to the old trend of cus-
tom comes the Quadrangle Fete
which for years has helped to make
Blackfriars the gala affair that it is.
In the show itself is the scene of

Teachers of public speaking and composition have long em-
phasized this point. Whatever you do, they have said with a bang
of fist upon table, — whatever you do, refer to experience. Be
concrete; give specific instances. Their pupils have heeded such
slogans, and we can see the improvement. Articles, lectures, editor-
ials, sermons, and even political speeches have become more con-
crete, and more effective. The platitude is passing. Those who
address the public are coming back to earth, where the public lives.

But this movement, like many another enthusiastic reform,
has gone to extremes. Writers and speakers use too many con-
crete illustrations, too many references to what their audience has
seen, felt, or eaten. They assume that their hearers can not reason
much beyond the two-and-two stage. Writers of popular-scientific
articles, writers of sermon-editorials in the Sunday supplements, and
speakers in college chapel are often guilty. They talk down to
their public. They spend too much time in making clear a point
that is reasonably clear already; hence they have no time left to
delve deep into their subject. The reader or hearer, especially if he
is around his twentieth year, is offended. He is being given an elem-
entary lesson, a thing most distasteful to him. His intellect (a
thing concerning which he is very sensitive) is belittled. The author
antagonizes his public and wastes energy that he might devote to
a keener analysis.

The speaker or the writer must know his public in and out.
He must know not only its weaknesses but its peculiar powers. Talk-
ing over its head is futile; but talking down to an intelligent public
will bring no better results.

FIRST CONTESTS

Goodman Makes Fourteen
Strikeouts in a
Row

Two graduate and one non-greek
contests were held yesterday after-
noon in the Non-Fraternity Division
of the Intramural Playground Ball
League. The style of play compared
favorably with that exhibited by the
Greek nines. The stellar pitching of
stellar pitching of Goodman, Mac
hurler, and the hefty swatting of the
graduate players featured the play.

Maci Win 13-0

In a game featured by the slugging
of the entire Mac team and the air-
tight pitching of Goodman, the Macs
walloped the Senators 13 to 0. The
Macs early rang up a lead on hits by
Sheer, Leviton, Semmtr, and Good-
man for six run lead. In the fifth
inning hits by Fellheimer, Lerner,
and Anderson added four more runs
and for the remainder of the tilt,
the Macs kept pegging away and in-
creasing their lead.

Goodman rang up fourteen
straight strikeouts before the Sena-
tors touched the horsthide. Leviton
pitched the final inning and struck
out two men, making a total of
nineteen out of a possible twenty-
one strikeouts for the two pitchers.

Hitchcock Defeat* C. T. S.

In the closest battle of the day,
Hitchcok hall barely won from the
Chiago Theological Seminary nine
by an 8 to 7 count. The winners
opened the game with heavy hitting,
scoring all of their runs in the first
three innings.

weakened in the fourth and the Sem-
inarians garnered four runs. This

WHAT o/ IT?

8tO\« MORGENSTERN

Monsieur Thomas Mulroy, head of
the track interscholastic and an old
dog at such affairs, has again shown
his wisdom in counsel. M. Mulroy
has evolved a most sage ruse for
making the visiting high school hoys
see the merit of old Chicago as a
place of education, etc. His clear
grasp of the fact that the rushing
done at past intersholastics somehow
failed to click has resulted in his
evolving a new plan of campaign—
one that utilizes campus women on
the rushing end of the interschol-
astic!

According to the official Mulroy

gave Mandes, the loosing Hurler some |)U|| announcing the happy arrange-
encouragement, and he tightened up m^nts. Miss Catherine Fitzgerald,
to hold the victors scoreless for the |)ianager of the strongarm brigade,

rest of the game.

Mandes and Carpenter brought in
runs in the last inning to bring the
score to 8-7. With only one out
against them it looked like the C. T.
S. outfit would tie the score. Dunaz
and Banks fell before the stellar
pitching of Bezazian, and the Sem-
inarians hopes faded out.

Hinkle - Crisler Team
Being Repeated Now?

Those who remember the famous
Hinkle and Crisler combination of
five years ago see reincarnation of
these athletes in the Hoerger-Mc-
Donough combination. Hinkle and
Crisler were both all-Conference ends
in football, teamed together as
guards on the champion basketball
team of 1920, and both were mem-
bers of the baseball team.

'Chuck Hoerger and John McDon-
ough were the best guarding com-
bination in the Big Ten last year on
the basketball floor, and both are
members of this year’s diamond
squad. And it is rumored that Stagg

will make the trip include Hudlin,

Reed predicts a creditable showing
for the tennis team in future starts,
now that they have hit a winning
pace.

The local squad was expected to
have been very powerful this year,
but the failure of George Lott to be-

Spring broke up hopes for a superior
Maroon net team.

Despite the absence of these men
and the lack of tourney experience
of most of the present squad, it has

one out of three of its meets thus

STERLING FIELDING AND PITCHING

Maroons Play Errorless Ball and Hammer Out Dozen Safe
Blows; Hoerger With Four Hits Leads

In Clouting

By Victor Roterus

Joey Gubbins, Maroon pitching ace
fooled, mystified and otherwise an-
noyed Northwestern batsmen with
his southpaw benders yesterday af-
ternoon, and the Maroons handed the
North Shore outfit a 7-0 beating to
ponder over in their idle moments.

Gubbins and his team mates, who
gave him faultless support, enjoyed
the exhibition immensely for it was
the same Northwestern team that had
defeated them some time ago in the
icy cold left over from last winter.
The visitors sawed the air in vain
। for they were only able to garner
1 but five hits, each of them coming in
a different inning, off the accomplish-
ed tossing of Gubbins. He has such
a big lead that he could afford to
snicker at the Northwestern threats,
none of which assumed noteworthy
proportions.

Hoerger Swats Four

Chuck Hoerger’s cruel nature
broke out when he slapped a trio of
Purple moundsmen for four hits, one
of which was a ringing triple that
cleared two tenanted bases of their
occupants to send them where they
belonged, at home.

The Maroons grabbed three runs in
the first. Anderson got on through
some flat-footed playing by North-
western’s short stop, and Macklind
sacrificed him to second. With two
out Brignall walked, and Webster
crashed the ball over second to score
Anderson. Then Gubbins slammed
one over first and Brignall jockeyed
home. Hoerger’s first safe blow
brought in Webster, but Chuck was

Schultz, heaving for the Purple, got
into trouble again in the next chap-
ter, but Palmer who replaced him
weathered the storm.

In the third McConnell and Brig-
nail banged out hits and they cant-
ered across the plate when Hoerger
unloosed his three base sock. Hoerg-

ger clubbed in another tally
fifth when Webster legged
from second.

I should be most happy to see M.
Mulroy prevailed upon to outline just
what the “right attitude’’ is; perhaps
if 1 have time I shall approach him
myself on this point. The reference
to “moonlight dance” and “last night
of meet” also has an ominous under-
tone. Something more than appears
upon the surface, methinks, is in
all this.

Not only has M. Mulroy with a
devilish cunning laid these pitfalls
in the path of the interscholastic
boys, but he has also shown his sa-
gacity in another direction. M. Mul-
roy did not leave the personnel of
his women’s committee to any hap-
hazard or random process of selec-
tion; he picked it himself. To any-
one who knows M. Mulroy at all well,
the significance of this move is in-
stantly apparent.

“It is only with the utmost co-
operation of the campus women,”
said Mulroy, in announcing his fell
scheme, “that this meet will be a
success.” /

men having almost made the varsity 25 counts in two meets, the only

squad this year. Among these are

western, so we are left with the job
of compiling the contribs. We make
no complaint at being left behind,
however, for the first and last time
we ate in that dinky old lunchroom
out there in Evanston was plenty.

AND besides the boys will prob-
ably get hooked into buying bids
for the dance that their hosts are
sponsoring next Friday night. In
recognition of his decision to have
us stay at home, we shall always in
the future look to Terrible Turk as
a veritable Saviour!

Now What Will Stevie’s Girl Say!

Dear Sir:

Women are like nickels. They are
found everywhere. When they are
new they are bright and some think
them beautiful, but they are hard
beneath the surface, and they soon
become dull and ugly. They serve to
amuse children. They are worth live
cents.

AN interesting communication was
received this morning, so, feeling
that it will help settle a question
that has been worrying all of us late-
ly, we take great pleasure in print-
ing it:

MR. and MRS. GIRL
announce the engagement of
daughter

MISS STEVIE’S GIRL
to

MR. STEVIE

their

The wedding will be held sometime
in June

NOTICES of this kind always
make us feel happy. We suggest
however, that the intended bride and
groom get together sometime before
the wedding and make up their minds
as to what they think of each other.
It might prove rather embarrassing
if they were to wait until after the
knot is tied. And besides, they both
just hate noise and battle!
