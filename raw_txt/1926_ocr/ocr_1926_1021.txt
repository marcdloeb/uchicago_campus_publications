The open season for politics is on.
The boys are beginning to “line
things up.” There is a considerable
amount of handshaking in progress.
There is much inquiry as to the
health of acquaintances. Bargaining
over the festive board in the Com-
mons lunch hours is widespread, and,
in the opinion of the boys, of some
importance. “Deals” are being con-
cocted. “You give me support for
this,” I hear on all sides, “and I’ll
see your man is put in as chess team
manager.” Even the dear old Y. M.

of several of the machines. His lieu-

even bargains made between his sup-

he fears there were. It is true that
he himself never allowed his hands
to get besmirched in the dirt of the
campus political ring. He merely sat
serenely back, innocent as a lamb of
what it was all about. Not so some
of the party chiefs who were super-
intending his candidacy. They knew

and on the previous occasions, con-
tests of the greatest interest have
taken place, largely due to the Ox-
ford style of debating. This method
which calls for a more informal type
of discussion, is used by most modern
teams and increases the interest from
the spectators’ viewpoint inestim-
ably.

The University team has not been
selected as yet, the first tryout being
next Tuesday in Harper Assembly
Hall. All students are eligible for
positions on the team and are strong-
ly urged to try out.

The subject for debate with the
University of Sydney is: “Resolved
that the results of the World War
have tended towards the peace of
the world.” Work on the prepara-
tion for this subject will start as
soon as candidates have been chosen,
and upon the completion of the de-
bate, work will immediately start for
the University of California contest.
The subject for that debate will be:
"Resolved that the Democratic idea
is a mistake in sentiment.”

Pep Maroons For
Purdue Tomorrow
Night in Mandel

The annual
which was to

next week on

freshman frolic
be held Friday
postponed until
account of the

Purdue pep session; according

to Miss Frances
charge.

Right after dinner
the band will start

Kendall in

parading the

campus, picking up men from the
fraternity houses, and working up
enthusiasm for the Purdue game
generally. The women of the Uni-
versity have postponed their fresh-
man frolic for a week on account
of the doings, which are scheduled
to start early in the evening so that

everybody can come.

fault that he was beaten on
choices, under the celebrated
system.

At

least, that is the way in which ।

he was told he was beat. True, ru-
mors drifted in to him months after
to the effect that there was even a
deal got up among some of the boys
on the Undergraduate Council to de-
fraud him—but this he never gave
credence to. The Undergraduate
Council he felt then (and has always
felt) was a body of the Campus Fa-
thers like the old Roman Senate—
a council of wise men gifted with a
paternal interest in the welfare of
the great mass of the students. It
was the province of this group (the
writer felt) to grasp the helm of the
ship in their firm, capable hands, and
to weather such storms as might
come up in a manner calculated to
benefit the largest number possible.
Farther than this, he felt, the activ-
ities of the Undergraduate Council
did not extend. The writer, in his
position as unsuccessful candidate, is
only too happy to take this oppor-
tunity to clear the onus from the
fair name (if any) of the Council.

committee in charge of Saturday’s

only a little more energy).

Donald Gallagher, sophomore as-
sistant in the business department of
The Daily Maroon, is at home with
a serious inflamation in the tissues
of his knee, which the attending phy-
sician said might confine him to his
bed for three months.

And

so the writer’s acquaintance

with the political situation of the
campus is, as you can see, founded
on experience. He knows what is up
when it is up, and the symptoms
which have been wafted in to his
keen nose by the autumn zephyrs
lately have led him to come out with
such statements as take up the first
paragraph of the current disserta-
tion. But because he points out the
fact that there ARE politics around,
he does not wish to give the feeling
that he thinks that another EVIL
has sprung up to plague the campus
for the time, until a better evil turns
up. Not at all. Politics, he has al-
ways found, have their place in the
American college system. It would
be useless to deny it. They are re-
freshing—as an avocation—to delve
in. Possibly they are even, to a cer-
tain extent, beneficial in their effect.
No, he does not complain about the
politics, but about the politicians:
they do not- seem to know that he
is “out of th’ game,” and, further-
more, that he wants to stay out.

Dedicate Joseph

Dedication services for the Jos-

pleted in July, will take place to-
day at 4 :30 in the new chapel. A
reception for all students and fac-
ulty members of the University-
will be held immediately after the
services in the commons room of
Swift hall. Speakers at the serv-
ices will be President Max Mason,
President Emeritus Harry Pratt

PEP SESSION FOR
OHIO GAME HELD
AT HONOR DANCE

Time out will be taken from the
Score Club-Skull and Crescent dance
for an informal pep session. The
honorary societies have, cooperated
with cheer headers in having this pep
session in connection with their dance
at the Shoreland hotel on the even-
ing before the game. “The Ohio
game,” says Robert Harman, man-
ager of the dance, “should add pep
and excitement to the hilarity of the
evening. Although we expect a large
crowd to attend, this fact should in
no way detract from the informality
of the occasion.

Enthusiasm for the Pledge dance
is being manifested in the rapid sale
of tickets. There will be represen-
tatives of the honorary societies at
the different fraternity houses, so
that everybody who wishes to attend
can be accommodated. Non fratern-

made to men of the University of

The pessimistic opinion that
the majority of University men
have not the remotest reason for
attending institutions of higher
learning has been disproven in
most cases. The majority of the
answers were definite in signify-
ing the student’s intention of be-
coming a dentist, doctor, an artist,
a teacher, or a writer. A few bold-

and one was merely “curious to
see how it would be.”

use of automobiles has been prohib-

THE CAMPUS CROSSES ELLIS AVENUE

MEW BUILDINGS on the University campus have been so common
of late that they have come to be a matter of course with us.
Breaking ground for one or placing the last coping stone on another
pass almost unnoticed with football games, dances, dates, pledging,
class elections and even studying to occupy our attention. The last
few years have seen tremendous strides made in the Unversity’s
building program. We do not appreciate this progress until it is
forced upon us. When a once vacant plot of ground seems suddenly
to have burst forth with a creation of magnificent beauty in stone.
And even then not much impression is made. We soon become as
habituated to the new arrival as the oldest inhabitant hereabouts is
to Cobb.

Rarely we venture to say is the great and painstaking labor nec-
essary to their construction even considered. Our buildings are not
slapdash affairs of brick covering a quickly erected frame work of
steel and concrete. The high speed construction methods that send
hotels, office-buildings, and apartments towering to the sky in a brief
sp^n of weeks cannot be used on the edifices that line the Midway.
To build in stone is to build slowly. Each great block of limestone
must first be planned for in the architect’s specifications, then care-
fully cut, and finally lowered into its allotted position with crane,
spirit-level and sight. Bricklaying is a matter of enough brick and
the men to lay them but each stone is an individual problem.

And now we see a long cumulation of effort taking its final form
across Ellis Avenue. Slowly but surely the new medical group has
been lifted into the horizon. Its massive yet delicate towers have
now melted into the Midway skyline. But for their white newness
one would think they had always kept their more easterly brethren
company, so well do they blend with them. The long finger of uni-
fied beauty invisibly stretches across the black asphalt that separates
Classics and the Billing Memorial Hospital and the physical void be-
tween them is obliterated in the binding power of a common con-
ception and a common loveliness. The new buildings fit perfectly
in a harmonious whole. The old rectangle is no more but east and
west it has widened its bounds in a tremendous sweep of line and
beauty along the Midway. The campus has crossed Ellis Avenue.

NEWSPAPER SPORTSMANSHIP

N THE “Chicago Evening American” for Tuesday, October 19, the

“Cork Tips

column, conducted by Jimmy Corcoran, was de-

voted almost entirely to the football situation at the Midway. In it
appeared several remarks about the Chicago team which »were rath-
er presuming, and not of the calibre expected of a good columnist.

The next morning, Wednesday, October 20 saw a double col-
umn space in the * Tribune" given to as satirical a football article as

the Chicago team, its coach, and his system.

Why should an article of this nature appear in the sport section
of any paper? A newspaper should carry in its sport pages the same
qualities of sportsmanship that appear in the sports themselves. This
article shows poor sportsmanhip on the part of those responsible for
its printing, and this can hardly be overlooked in any newspaper.

STAGG SCRIMMAGES VARSITY TO STRENGTHEN ATTACK

GYM TEAM IS OUT
FOR ANOTHER BIG
TEN CHAMPIONSHIP

Coach Hoffer Pleased With
Outlook; Many Vets
Return

With all but two men of the 1926
national collegiate championship
gymnasium team back this year
Coach Dan Hoffer is “Looking at the
World Through Rose Colored Glass-
es” and expecting nothing less than
another conference championship for
1927. After the conference meet,
which will be held here March 11 and
12, another national title will be
the goal of the Maroon Gymnasts.

While at the present Coach Hof-
fer’s aim may seem a trifle high, the
records of Chicago’s gym teams dur-
ing the past fourteen years, since
Coach Hoffer took charge, fully jus-
tify it.

Seven Time* Champa

During that period the world war
kept the gym team inactive two
years, leaving only twelve years of
actual competition. Out of the 12
years Chicago took the conference
championship seven times, and the
national championship twice. In
1923 Wisconsin defeated the Ma-
roons by a margin of one point. Be-
fore Coach Hoffer came to Chicago
the gym team had won but one con-
ference championship in seven years.

Four letter men, ex-captain Quin,
Captain Davidson, Nelson and Flex-
ner, supported by two minor “C”
men, Benson and McRoy and a squad
of sophomores will compose the team
this year.

Several of the letter men ranked
high in the individual championship
competition last year. This year will
probably see them at the top in their
events.

Schedule Arranged (

Before the conference pieet the
team will compete with Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin, Purdue and the Milwau-
kee “Y” teams here and Ohio, Illi-
nois and Navy on their home gym-
nasiums.

Illinois, the ancient rival of the
Maroons has won the conference
championship but twice during the
past twenty-one years. Wisconsin,
with seven championships since 1905,
ranks second to Chicago in the num-
ber of titles won:

MAROONS IN MANY
EAST-WEST GAMES

Chicago has engaged in more foot-
ball games with eastern schools than
has any other member of the West-
ern Conference, except Michigan.
The Wolverines have played no less
than forty-nine such contests and
lead the Big Ten in this respect by
far.

The Maroons, who are second,
have played seventeen games with
eastern schools as opponents, seven
of them being with the University
of Pennsylvania. Of these battles
Chicago has won four, lost ten, and
tied three.

STAGG TO COACH

I-M TRACK MEN

Plans are now being made for the
Second Annual Intramural Cross
Country Run which is to be held on
November 10th over Washington
Park’s two and one half mile course.

As an added incentive to partici-
pation in the event Coach Stagg has
volunteered to personally coach the
runners. . For this purpose a- class
will be held every morning on Stagg
Field between the hours of 10 and
11.

Numerous Award*

The awards will consist of a large
trophy to the winning team; a cup to
the runners up, and a smaller cup to
the third-place winners. A gold med-
allette will be awarded to the first-
place winners, and a silver medal-
lette to the runer up. Third to
tenth place winners will receive
bronze emblems.

As this is the only Intramural
track event during the autumn quar-
ter a large turn-out is expected. A
medical examination is required be-
fore the run. Varsity track men and
those failing to pass the examina-
tions are the only ones barred from
competition.

A three weks’ period of training is
required of each candidate; therefore
all entry blanks must be in early.

Last year the Delta Sigma Phi
team won the race in a spectacular
style. They have already started
the grooming of this year’s team and
are confident.

Dark Hor*e* Prevail

Because of the presence of such
stars as Williams, Giest, Burke, and
Ault in last year’s list of entrants
the result of the tourney was perhaps
a forgone conclusion. This year,
however it is truly a dark horse af-
fair, everyone being conceded an
equal chance. This many men will
come out who woth otherwise be dis-
uaded by lack of confidence.

As the track is in superb condition
the Intramural Department feels
confident of running the meet off in
a highly successful fashion.

PURDUE OFFENSE
BEING BOLSTERED
FOR MAROON GAME

Phelan Discovers New
Star In “Dutch”

Koransky

Lafayette, Ind., Oct. 20.—Drills
of the Purdue football squad by
Coach Jimmy Phelan this week are
seeking to develop an offensive punch
that will mean points in the pinches,
and to bolster the Boilermakers’ de-
fensive to withstand the pounding
that it will receive from the heavy
Chicago backfield and line at the
annual Purdue-Chicago football
game on the Midway next Saturday
afternoon. This week’s practice per-
iods opened with a light drill Mon-
day, were speeded up yesterday af-
ternoon and will be stiff today, with
a hard scrimmage against Coach
Swank’s freshmen team as a feature.

Offenae Falters

Purdue’s defensive play against
Wisconsin Saturday was an improve-
ment over other games this season,
but it could be much better in the
opinion of Coach Phelan. The offense
faltered for three-quarters against
the Badgers, and only blazed forth
then fell short of a winning score by
the margin of a few yards. Getting
strong in the final quarter and even
these final few yards is the aim of
the coaching staff this week.

“Cotton” Wilcox performed in his
usual brilliant fashion last Saturday,
but the game developed that Purdue
has a fullback of the first water in
“Dutch” Koransky, a junior from
Chicago, who has played much fine
ball Tor the Boilermakers, but who
reached new heights of offensive and
defensive skill in the game with the
Badgers. It is needless to say that
these two offensive stars will come
in for some close watching from the
Maroons.

Will Bring Band

There is no doubt but that Purdue
will have its largest delegation at the
game, as 2,500 seats have already
been sold here and 1,000 more order-
ed. The game will dedicate Chi-
cago’s new stadium, with its 50,000
seating capacity. A special train
will carry Purdue’s rooters and the
famous Purdue Military Band, which
will parade between halves and fur-
nish music for the contest.

Each section of the pool will
measure 30 by 60 feet. At one
end, divers will use the four spring
boards unobstructed by swimmers
and will plunge into water nine to
eleven feet deep. The pool’s bot-

First String Men Work Hard To Prepare For Purdue Contest
Victory Over Strong Purdue Boilermaker Squad
Will Mean Regained Prestige

By Victor Roterus

The Maroons, who have been the
butt of more wise-cracking than any
other team in the country this year,
again went at it hard and earnestly
last night. From the way the play-
ers conducted themselves during the
practice it seems that they have a
great deal of faith in this “he who
laughs last” stuff; and would like
very much to give the dear public
the merry hee-haw on some of these
coming Saturdays when the Maroons
are expected to be buried under an
avalanche of touchdowns, drop-kicks,
safeties and what not.

The boys realized that if they top-
pled Purdue over on Saturday it
might be an occasion to affect a few
smiles, while if they should fail and
become toppled instead, theirs will
be a hard lot to bear. Coach Stagg,
himself, is not immune from the gen-
tle panning being directed from all
quarters, and he would probably like
to see his team win. So although the
game with Purdue will do nothing to
decide in which direction the confer-
ence cup will go, it means a little
something to a group of individuals

ML TAMM N

that hang out quite a bit around
Bartlett.

The team was hitt fig on all seven
last night. Stagg harped mostly
about the offense ,of which there was
none at Penn. Although the Frosh
shot some Boilermaker formations
at the varsity, the plays in order for
the* greater part of the sesion were
Stagg’s own concoctions. Again the
varsity failed to gain with the con-
sistency that they should have. The
freshmen, who every night look to
have the makings of football play-
ers, disported themselves in a man-
ner not at all in accordance with the
usual policy of freshman teams when
battling the varsity . The yearling
outfit stopped the passes and rushes
of the first-stringers as if they had
a perfect right to do so. Hoerger at-
tended practice in civies, while Mc-
Kinney did not report at all, he still
being troubled with injuries.

Reports have it that Purdue is also
devoting most of its time to offen-
sive actions. The Boilermakers came
out of the Badger game without any
serious injuries and will have their
full strength on the field Saturday.
