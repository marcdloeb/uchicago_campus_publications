PHI BETE KEYS
NOT ONLY GOAL
SAYS CHARTERS

Newer Education Stresses
Personality and

Character

“It is of little profit to gain a Phi
Beta Kappa key at the expense of
social forcefulncss, friendliness anti
unselfishness,” asserted Prof. W. W.
Charters of the school of education
in a discussion of education and char-
acter development, broadcast last
night from the University through
The Daily News radio station,
WMAQ.

Modern colleges and universities
are already paying much attention to
the personality of their students,
Prof. Charters said, and cited the ap-
pointment of counsellors for enter-
ing students at the University as an
example of the new type of work.
In his opinion, even the impersonal
contacts of classroom and lecture hall
go far toward building character by
mental discipline.

Gives Formula for Success

“My formula for success in social
relations, at least, is this: Success in
handling people equals two parts of
personality and one part brains,” was
one of the startling pronouncements
of the lecturer, who is an authority in
the field of vocational training. Many
universities have special agencies for
vocational guidance, he said, and re-
commend a choice of profession only
after careful diagnosis and test of ।
the student’s abilities.

Education must teach high ideals ।
to be a beneficial social agency, Prof.
Charters concluded. Partly through !
books and partly through personal
contact, every university should strive
to develop character at the same time
as it imparts information;

Clashes With Newlin

Prof. Charters’ statements con-
cerning the worth of a Phi Beta Kap-
pa key recalls the recent denunciation
of student attitude toward scholar-
ship voiced by Prof. W. J. Newlin, of
Amherst College.

That undergraduates considered
the worth of the scholastic emblem
in terms of dollars and cents —
namely $6.50 provoked the plea of
Prof. Newlin for higher standards
and a more respectful attitude to-
ward scholarship on the part of
alumni.

Scholarship Considered Secondary

“Thousands of dollars for a new
stadium, and how much for a chem-
ical laboratory?” asked the eastern
scholar. “Scholarship is secondary
to social distinction, and the man or
woman who wins scholastic recogni-
tion is scorned by his classmates.”

The problem of the Phi Beta Kappa
key and its actual value has long
been the keynote of sociologists and
scholars.

GREEKS TO PREPARE
Pi EDGES FOR ‘RAZZ’

SESSION NEXT WEEK

That week so feared by freshmen
pledged to fraternities has come
around again to haunt the neophytes.
Wierd stories and tales of past in-
itiations are being passed around and
to the men concentrate their “gray
matter” on the best methods to avoid
their just dues. Snme have al-
ready had their “Hell Week,” while
others are now enjoying the efforts
of their upperclassmen.

Delta Upsilon initiated their
pledges last week, and, according to
the new fratres, a merry time was
had by nearly everyone present. Phi
Pi Phi is initiating this week, and the
features are two freshmen plays, the
nature of which is not revealed. Tai
Delta Phi pledges are going through
the ordeal, which will culminate in a
house party after the formal initia-
tion on Saturday. Kappa Sigma, Pi
Lambda Phi, and two or three others
are looking forward to next Monday
to start the proceedings.

WILKINS RESTING
QUIETLY, STATES

DR. KRETSCHMER

“Although Mr. Wilkins is get-
ting along well, we are unable to
say when he will return to his
University duties.”

This statement was made early
today by Dr. Herman L. Kretsch-
mer, of the faculty of the Rush
Medical school, who is in attend-
ance upon Dean Wilkins in his ill-
ness, at the Presbyterian hospital.
Other physicians under whose ob-
servation the dean has been
placed, concurred with Dr. Kret-
schmer’s statement.

Mr. Wilkins is suffering from a
slight internal disorder, and, in
addition, from a nervous condition
brought on by overwork and phy-
sical strain. While his condition
is not serious, a complete rest has
been ordered and he has been re-
lieved from all University work for
the time being.

“Mr. Wilkins is resting easily,
and his general condition is great-
ly improved,” concluded Dr. Kret-
schmer. No more specific state-
ment than this was issued.

SERVICE ORDER

WILL INITIATE

Kedu Remthett Holds Cere-
monies for New Members

Initiation into the order of Kedu
Remthct, honorary service organiza-
tion for men of the University will be
held next week, according to William
W innet, Khenti of the organization.

Those who are eligible for admission
into the order are to hand in their
papers describing their activities in
the field of social service.' The defin-
ite requirements for these pikers may
be obtained from the officers of the or-
ganization.

Admission into Kedu Remthet is
based not on scholarship as is the re-
quirement in other organizations, but
upon actual service. All applicants are
men who have had at least one year’s
experience in the field of social serv-
ice, having given on the average of
one night each week to work in one of
the Settlement houses or other char-
itable organizations in the interest of
serving those persons who could in no
other way receive the advantages thus
offered.

The experiences of members in these
fields are already on file in the form
of papers written for initiation. They
are now at the headquarters of Kedu
Remthet and are open to members of
classes in sociology and other courses
as well as to prospective members of
the order.

Members of Kedu Remthet have
been connected with the social service
committee of the Y. M. C. A. The
two organizations have been cooperat-
ing to get men placed in the various
charitable institutions of the city. The
University Settlement house looks for-
ward yearly to these two associations
as well as the Y. W. C. A. to supply
many of its leaders for the classes
and groups which meet there.

WOMEN SPEAKERS

Pres. Max Mason will be the guest
of honor at the Senior class dinner to
be held Thursday, Jan. 21. The din-
ner is the first social function that has
been planned for the class as a whole
this year, and it is expected that a
representative number will attend. The
committee in charge has not yet an-
nounced where the dinner will be held.

Name Speakers

them early. The places of sale will be
announced later.

“As this is the first senior dinner
for the year,” said Miller, “we shall
expect all members of the class to at-
tend. The committees are chairmaned
by capable seniors and that in itself
should insure a successful affair.”

Hagey Withdraws
From Nomination
In Freshman Race

Harry Hagey, who had been nom-
inated for treasurer of the freshman
class in chapel on Monday, handed his
formal withdrawal to Addison Wilson,
who is conducting the election for the
Undergraduate Council yesterday af-
ternoon. This leaves four candidates
for the office; Rainey Bennett, Harry
•Bradley, Donald McGuiness, and
Frank Carson.

According to Wilson, all withdraw-
als from the elections must be in his
hands before noon today. The same
is true of all nominations by petition.
This is in compliance with the rules
under which all class elections are con-
ducted.

Several more withdrawals are ex-
pected before the election is finally
held next Monday.

THREE WORKS BY
FACULTY MEN IN

A. L. A. BOOK LIST

The American Library Association
has named, at the request of the com-
mittee on intellectual development of
the League of Nations, what it con-
siders to he the leading books of 1924.
Three of their selections were written
by men connected with the University.

The association named forty books.
It is declared that these forty will be
included in the list of 600 titles of
the leading literature of the world, to
be published soon by the League.

Under the heading of Social Science,
the committee has listed Professor
Charles Edward Merriam’s work.
“Non-voting: Causes and Methods of
Control.” Harold Foote Gosnelle was
joint author of the book.

Albion Woodbury Small’s book on
“The Origins of Sociology,’ and Dean
Shailer Mathews “Contributions of
Science to Religion” were also includ-
ed in the list, the first under Sociology
and the second under Religion.

Grit Your Teeth, Knit Your Brow,
And Be a Phi Bete, Says Bills

When you knit your brow and
clench your fists you can think harder
than when you relax, it is shown in
recent studies of muscular tension con-
ducted in the University Psychology
department by A. G. Bills. His inves-
tigations illuminate the problem of
muscular and mental cooperation, it is
stated.

The results were obtained from ex-
periments on University students to
find out whether their mental ability
was accelerated or retarded when they
were under extreme muscular tension.
It was discovered that in every case
th<. student could do faster and more
accurate work when the muscles of
hi- arm were tense.

While he gripped a dynamometer, a
device similar to the hand gr.ps used
by athletes in training, the subject was
given a series of psychological tests
in addition, memorizing and percep-
tion. Then he was made to repeat the
tests while he sat quietly in a relaxed
position. He reacted more efficiently
in the first tests.

Appoint Prominent Men to^in in Bartlett

Assist University

A Citizens’ Committee on Chemis-
try to assist the University in the de-
velopment of its Department of
Chemistry has been announced by
Charles H MacDowell, president of
the Armour Fertilizer works and
chairman of the committee. The
committee will undertake to raise, in
co-operation with the University,
$3,235,000 for a new laboratory
building and the endowment of in-
struction and research in chemistry.

The new laboratory building for
research and graduate work, costing
$1,285,000, is the immediate objec-
tive.

The Committee is made up of
twenty-six of Chicago’s prominent
business men. Harry Gottlieb, sec-
retary of S. W. Straus and Company,
is vice president, and Dr. H. I. Schle-
singer, professor of chemistry at the
University, is secretary.

MacDowell Acclaim* Chemsitry

In commenting upon the enter-
prise, Mr. MacDowell said:

“Chemistry is pre-eminently the
science of industry. It deals with the
composition and decomposition of
matter. In the twenty year period
since 1905 chemistry, particularly in
its application to the industries, has
made greater strides than in any
other period of time in the history
of the world. This too is the period
of Chicago’s great industrial growth.
In these two decades much that was
previously obscure and mysterious
has been made clearer and more un-
destandable — the ultimate composi-
tion of matter, the structure of the
atom, the cause and effect of radio-
activity, the structure of metals and
alloys, the colloidal state, catalysis,
heat and pressure chemistry, which is
making epochal progress in Germany,

SARGENT SPEAKS AT

PHI BETE MEETING

Undergraduate Phi Beta Kappa will
hold its first meeting of the quarter
today at 4:30 at the home of Prof.
William A. Nitze, head of the depart-
ment of Romance, at 1220 East 56th
Street.

The Undergraduate council has been
invited to attend this meeting at which
Prof. Walter Sargent, head of the Art
department will speak on “How to
Study Exhibitions of Paintings.” Ac-
cording to Allen Miller, President of
Phi Beta Kappa, various groups of
students have been invited to meet-
ings so that they may further realize
the meaning of the organization to the
University.

curate work the effects of muscular
tension were found to be less beneficial
than where great speed was required.
Contrary to accepted theories, when
he continued at the job for a long time
under tension he was still able to
keep up his speed and seemed to ex-
perience less fatigue than when he
worked in a relaxed state.

Just exactly what happens to the
body and the mind is explained by
scientists as due to a heightened ton-
icity or tension,

MAROON REPORTERS

SLEEP IN BARTLETT

Two Maroon Frosh reporters, S.
Victor Roterus and Jack Welty, spent
half last night in the Intra-mural of-
fice in Bartlett gym as a result of
too zealous attention to duty.

Roterus and Welty were assigned
to cover last night’s Intra-mural bas-
ketball games and stayed in the gym-
nasium afterwards to write the story.
They were to report to the printers
with the copy as soon as they had
done the work.

After several hours of waiting with
the proofreaders, the sports editor re-

from Roterus—
gym—saying that
the two had strayed all over Stagg
field trying to get out and were now
looking for a night watchman.

Roterus started to dictate the story
overthe phone, when an unknown per-
son intervened, saying that he was
sending a special watchman to Bart-
lett immediately to let the two out.

At about 2:30 Roterus and his story
finally arrived at the printers—just
in time for the Maroon to pay over-
time on today’s paper.

Phoenix to Start

Contest in First
Number for 1926

A new cover by Rainey Bennett, a
mysterious contest, some fresh jokes
and one or two legends from the pen of
Fred Handschy, some drawings by
Bennett, Cotant, and company—these
are the principal things the staff is
offering the campus in the new and
rapidly approaching Phoenix.

Nor is this all. Many other deli-
cacies are being prepared for campus
consumption, but unfortunately their
nature is such that they must be with-
held for the present.

Handschy, the editor of this naga-
zine, wishes to remind all contributors
and prospective contributors that the
Phoenix deadline will roll around to-
morrow, and that all copy should come
in today if possible.

Addison Wilson, business manager
of the Phoenix, says that its circula-
tion is constantly increaing, and that
good advertising is now easier to ob-
tain.

W. A. A. SETS DATE
FOR WINTER QUARTER
INITIATION AND DINNER

W. A. A. initiation for those women
who have earned the required one hun-
dred points will take place at a dinner
next Wednesday, at 6 in the sun par-
lor of Ida Noyes hall. Preceding the
dinner stunts arranged by Margaret
Heindl will be presented. The initiates
will be the main participants in these
stunts .according to the custom of
previous initiation coremonies.

Tickets for the dinner are on sale
for fifty cents from 11 to 1 in the
foyer of Ida Noyes hall today, tomor-
row, Friday, and next Monday. Tic-
kets may also be procured from Vic-
toria Smith, chairman of the affair, in
Kelly hall.

Women who wish to earn points for
W. A. A. have been requested to meet
today at 3:30 in the student office on
the third floor of Ida Noyes hall.

ANDERSON TO
TELL SENIORS

OF CAMPAIGN

To Describe ‘All for Chicago’
Drive in Chapel

Next Thursday

Preliminary to the “All For Chicago”
campaign few criticisms on all phases
of activity within the bounds of the
quadrangles will be a five minute ad-
dress in Senior chapel next Thursday.

The address will be delivered by
Charles Anderson, president of the
Undergraduate Council.

Anderson will explain to his class
mates the basis of the "All For Chi-
cago” idea. His speech will be deliv-
ered one week before the time of ac-
tual criticism, and will contain a com-
plete explanation of what the Under-
graduate council hopes to attain by its
campaign.

Ask For Criticisms

In Senior chapel, January 21, the
members of the graduating class will
receive “All For Chicago” blanks. On
these blanks they will be expected to
write whatever criticisms they may
have of the University.

It is expected by the council that
the criticisms, based on three years’
association with the life of the cam-
pus, will be invaluable in remedying
what deficiencies remain in the struc-
ture of the school.

“The fundamental objective of the
scheme,” said Charles Anderson, au-
thor of the idea, “is to obtain a frank
criticism of the University from the
Senior’s point of view. The greater
the number of comments the more we
shall be pleased. Every bit of criti-
cism will be considered, whether con-
structive of destructive.”	-----

Chapel attendance on January 21
will be based on the slips turned in
by the seniors, who, although they are
not required to criticize, must hand
in slips if they are to receive credit
for chape! attendance. ,

The opinions and criticisms of the
seniors will be collected and then
sorted to obtain an idea of the most
general objections to the curriculum
found by the seniors. Action will
probably be based on the strength of
the criticism with consideration first
for quality, its advantageous effect
upon the student body, then for its
effect upon the general curriculum, and
third for the number of students find-
ing this common fault.

Seek Seniors’ Opinions

The criticisms are to be classified
according to subject and department
and then turned over to the heads of
departments and those which cannot
be ascribed to any particular class will
be turned over to committees which
will be appointed by the council. A
general report with recommendations J
for improvements will be the result of
compiling all the reports and from this
statement of students’ opinions, prop-
er action~Tnay be taken, which is the
ultimate object of conducting such a
campaign.

Interest in this new campaign, con-
ducted among seniors only, is grow-
ing rapidly. The general opinion of
the fourth year students is that the
Undergraduate Council has taken a
very commendable step which will
result in great benefit to the class
and the University.

ENGLISH JOURNALIST

TO SPEAK ON DRAMA

“The Place of Shakespeare in Eliza-
bethan Drama” will be the subject of a
lecture by Ernest H. C. Oliphant, to-
morrow at 4:30 in Harper M-ll.

Mr. Oliphant, whom both Melbourne
and London claim as a native, is an
authority on the drama of the Eliza-
bethan period. He is author of several
books, “The Place of Shakespeare in
Elizabethan Drama” among them, and
is also a leader writer on the Mel-
bourne Herald.

WHAT A BOOK STORE MIGHT BE

A UNIVERSITY is primarily an institution established for the ad-
vancement of knowledge, and the education of the country’s
young people. Why, then, do we not make every part of the Uni-
versity truly educational?

Take the book store, for instance. One day go in there for candy,
stamps, theme paper, pencils, pennants, and text books. But when
we consider buying a book which we expect to read and treasure, or
when we want to spend a rainy afternoon in reading, we do not turn
to the University book store, which should be the logical place for
us to visit. We do not go there because it is not interesting. Several
things, are required to make it attractive and interesting to the book
lover rather than to the textbook purchaser. And the first of these
is atmosphere—the kind of atmosphere that is provided by soft rugs
and a fireplace which, on cold or dark afternoons, will hold a real
fire. There should be chairs, and a table or two, with attractively
bound books, spread out for examination.

New books, old books, second-hand books, rare books, and bound
magazines should all be included in the stock. True enough, the
student may read and examine many books in the libraries, but he
does not feel the sense of ownership there which is a great part of
the booklover’s enjoyment. But, most of all, the salespeople should
be themselves booklovers, who can sympathetically and pleasantly
help students to know and understand books better.

Education along the lines of real appreciation of literature is one
of the most important needs the University has to fill. We hope that
at some time not too far in the future college and university book
stores may attain this most desirable atmosphere.

ANNOUNCEMENT

'PHE expose which The Daily Maroon promised its readers
J- last Friday must, unluckily, be postponed for a few days.
We hope, however, that our readers will continue to scan this
page daily; we want none of them to miss it when it appears.

TODAY OR TOMORROW?

(In Senior chapel last week Dean Ernest Hatch Wilkins compared
the vast future of the human race with its brief past, and concluded
that our actions today, since they will cast their influence over so
great a period, are far more important than we realize. . He pictured
a “reunion of the centuries/’ in which men and women from all the
ages may be imagined to gather, like alumni at homecoming. We
may in our minds attend such a reunion, he said; we may meet con-
temporaries there whom we now ignore, and feel that they are our
comrades; we may shake them by the hand and say, “So you’re from
the twentieth century, too.”

This point of view—held, we believe, by most of the University’s
builders—meets with disagreement in some of our readers. Mr.
Tom Butcher opposes it in the following letter.—Editor. )i

To the Editor:

The talk in Senior chapel Thurs-
day morning carried with it certain
implications that, I believe, failed to
do justice to the genuine convictions
of the speaker. After an effective
portrayal of the relatively brief
period of time during which man has
already existed on this earth in con-
trast with the reasonable life-expect-
ancy of the race, it was suggested
--that one’s first reaction is to feel the
insignificance of the life of the in-
dividual as such.

Well enough. But the words which

followed in an attempt to see valid-
ity in life here and now had recourse
to what seems to me to be one of the
most insidious fetishes of modern
civilization. For it was affirmed that
life today is of tremendous import-
ance because it has a formative power
in molding the life conditions under
which tl^ men of the future must
live; that if mankind were to last
only ten days more, or even
a hundred years more, that it would
matter very little what we do in the
meantime. Men are wont to regard

SOCIAL SPHERE

By Alta Cundy

Its revolving again,—this sphere of
social activities!

Living in this sphere has its im-
portance certainly when one as busy as
Pres. Mason has time to attend the
many social functions that he is go-
ing to attend this Winter quarter. The
Freshmen banquet on Friday night is
the first of the invitations accepted
by the President. At this banquet the
nominees for class offices will be pre-
sented to the Freshman members and
to Pres. Mason. This affair will take
place at Hutchinson commons where
six hundred guests are expected.

Frank O’Hara has been the
guest for this banquet and
host on that evening.

nasium of the hall. The Wesley club
tea will be given from 4 to 6, and the
Women Speaker’s club has its open
meeting from 7 to 8.

The Reynolds dub wants us to note

the Westminster club dinner at which
Dr. Stone will address the guests.

Sigma Pledge Dance

The Sigma pledges have issued in-
vitations to the pledges of every club
iniviting them to a tea at Ida 'Noyes
hall on Friday, Jan. 15. The guests are
in turn to ask pledges from the frat-
ernities. It is an exclusively pledge
affair, not even the Sigma members
can attend if they have passed beyond
the title of “pledge.” so the story goes.

The Sphere is very much interested
in the problems to be discussed on
Friday afternoon when the class of-
ficers of all four classes will meet with
Mrs. Merrill to plan a social program
for the classes this quarter.

Too often have I enjoyed the words

to believe for a moment that this is
his thought, but it is what he seemed
to many of us to say. If life is not
worth as much here and now as it
shall ever be, if the next hundred
years are not of as much importance
in and of themselves as any that go
before or after, then are we all dupes
in the mighty power of Circumstance.
What can all the science in the world
do to bring to men what a single
Plato has brought? The increasing
complexity of civilization will cer-

conscious direction of it to be mini-

another realm, and woe to him who
thinks to find them more accessible

Gist, Marshall, Kaplan and
Williams Show Up
Very Well

By Irving Goodman

Although not blessed with an over-
abundance of good material, Coach
Fritz Crisler has a few capable yearl-
ing eagers around which to build up
a strong freshman basket team who
will keep the varsity stepping. Among
the oustanding candidates for the
squad are Gist, the elongated all-cen-
ter from Hyde Park, and a fast floor
man; Kaplan, the stock forward from
Englewood who is a dead eye on long
shots and a trickly handler of the ball;
and Cooper of Linblom, a big forward
and good shot but somewhat slow.

Williams of Bowen and Marshal of
Hyde Park are two crack guards who
will give McDonough and Hoerger
plenty of competition to keep their
varsity berths next year. Both are
rugged, clever dribblers, and Marshal
in particular excels on sinking long)
baskets.

Many Show Ability

Among the others who have shown
most ability include “Sonny” Good-
man, former Marshall star, forward;
Kelly, of St. Ignatius, numeral winner
in football, guard; McEwen of St.
Johns, guard; Fellheimer of Pontiac,
guard; McGregor of Yankton, S. D.,
forward; Sheer, of Newberry, Mich.,
guard: Bowman, a six foot four man
from Streator, center; Forkel of Oak
Park, forward; McCarthy of Hyde
Park, forward; Feingold of Marshall,
and Cutter of Elgin.

Fritz will probably make another
cut in the squad soon in order to be-
gin intensive drilling for scrimmage
with the varsity. The team as yet docs
not seem quite to measure up to last
year’s strong five, although there are
many men of varsity calibre. However

WHAT o/ IT?

J^teOl^

While casually strolling about the
basement of Bartlett Gymnasium Mon-
day evening, I saw Mr. Graham Kern-
wein’s prostrate form borne in by a
number of retainers fend placed rev-
erently on Trainer Simon Bensons op-
erating table. Here. I thought, was
something up. And such, indeed, was
the case. Mr. Kernwein, it developed,
was incapacitated with a pulled ten-
don, suffered while jogging about the
track under the eyes of the venerable
Mr. Thomas Eck.

The bad word went around fast.
“He will be out,” was the purport of
the whispering which ran around the
battlements, “for something over a

month
term *

I need not say here that the

“out” signified that

wein would be unable to
his chosen running events

Maroon followers as to the caliber

of future Chicago quintets

of latent basketball talent in

for Fritz
developer

Crisler in his day was a member of
Chicago’s greatest basketball team of
Halliday, Vollmer, Birkhoff, Hinkle,
and Crisler. Fritz was probably the
best guard the Midway has ever pro-
duced. and ever since Crisler has tak-
en charge of the freshman basketball
teams Chicago has always been forti-
fied with strong guards.

Several Have Not Reported

Many strong yearling eagers have
not reported for sundry reasons while
(Continued on page 4)

I am sorely troubled over Mr. Kern-
wein’s condition. Here is a noble
athlete laid low by one fell stroke. Not
only docs his injury hinder him from
indulging in those bursts of speed that
bring honor to the old school on the
running track, but his fraternity bas-
kethall team, embroiled in the rigors
of the Popopulopopouse tournament,
will be grievously weakened, for the
rigors of the football season had so
hardened Mr. Kernwein to the tak-
ing of punishment that he was a par-
ticularly valuable man in those Spar-
tan competitions which are the rule in
the interfraternity league.

Plans have been made by the Intra-

Wrestling Tournament, one of the fea-

Program now in progress. Prelimin-
ary matches will be held on Wednes-

list of the men known to be ineligible
under these rulings is to be sent to the

Many Awards

Awards for the tourney include a

Badger Cage Win
Frightens Maroons?

As a result of their victory over the
powerful Hoosier quintet, Wisconsin
looms all the more monstrous in the
eyes of the Maroon eagers. Meanwell’s
for Maroon teams to solve but Mc-
system has always been a hard one
Donouch and Hoerger are deemed ca-
pable of halting the pivoting Madison
forwards who have not been stopped
this season. '

The Maroon defense is receiving a
thorough overhauling in the secret
scrimmages every night. Norgren is
working his proteges long past the
chimes sound the supper bell to make
up for the late start of the practice
season. Zimmerman and Sackett are
given special instructions on quick
breaking and methods of eluding the
potent Badger defense.

But in yet another way will the col-
legians be induced to sit up late at
night to bear the latest reports on Mr.
Kernwein’s condition. I am referring
to the interest which must necessarily
be awakened in'the progress'of the ail-
ing muscle by the fact that Mr. Kern-
wein is a leader in the annual Wash-
ington Prom, an event which marks
the height of the collegians’ social year.
If Mr. Kernwein is still “out” when
February 22 rolls around, there is in-
deed going to be great to-do. It may,
in fact, be considered even more of a
cause for anxiety than if Mr. Kernwein
should not be in shape for the annual
quadrangular track meet at North-
western university late next month,
although it would be difficult to con-
vince Mr. Tom Eck of that view.

had an unusually hard time getting
started they show promise of becom-
ing very successful. The classes were
started and organized by Harriet Ray.
who is prominent in W. A. A. The

any individual event will make the reg-

Many Events

The events to he run off are: the
50 yard dash, low and high hurdles,
the 440 yard run, the 880, mile, two

and .high jump. Entries may be given
any afternoon to Elmer Lampe on the
main floor of the gym. Lonnie Stagg
also says that those who are not stars
need not be afraid to enter since most
of the varsity and numeral men are in
very poor condition so that at the out-
side. chances for medals are excellent.

THREE FRATERNITY QUINTETS LOOM

UP AS POSSIBLE CONTENDERS FOR
INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL CROWN

Alpha Tau Omega Beats Psi Upsilon; Kappa Sigma Defeats
Last Year’s Champions; Delta Sigma Phi
Also Wins

By V. Roterus and J. Welty

In the most significant game of an
evening of hectic battles, the Phi Kap*
pa Sigma basketball machine upset
the Phi Kappa Psi aggregation, last
year’s champions, by a 19-10 count.
The victors’ accurate basket-tossing
and superb defensive skill resulted in
the triumph. The Alpha Tau Omega
team also furnished food for thought
in fraternity circles when they
trounced the vaunted Psi Upsilon out-
fit 24-16. George Lott, recently de-
clared ineligible for varsity competi-
tion, was held to a lone point. The
biggest score of the night was con-
tributed by the Delta Sigma Phi
group who ran up 41 to Pi Lambda
Phi’s 1.

Showing a brilliant passing game
coupled with some excellent shooting
Alpha Tau Omega scored one of the
bigges upsets of the evening when it
defeated the Psi U’s by a score of 24
to 16. The A. T. O’s showed the best
class thus exhibited and look like this
year’s champs. Murphy with his close
guarding and long shots was the star
of the winners. Anderson showed his
scoring ability by garnering five field
goals. The remarkable guarding of
the game is illustrated by the fact
that George Lott, ineligible varsity
forward, was held without a basket.

Kajppa Sigs Win

Phi Kappa Sigma defeated the Phi
Psi’s last year’s champs 19 to 10 in
the other upset, Hibbolt with four

Lambda Chis Lose

Led by Anderson who got six goals
from the floor the S. A. E.’s beat
Lambda Chi Alpha 22 to 4. The of-
fense of the losers was unpolished
and much below par.

In a very close game featured by
close guarding of both teams Tau
Delta Phi downed Delta Upsilon 8 to
5. The scoring work of the Tau Delts
was equally divided between four men
each of which scored a field goal. The
scoring work of both teams was far
from polished but the defenses stood
out.

The
going

Dekes Down Kappa Nu
Dekes, after a slow start got
and easily downed the Kappa

Nu’s 18 to 6. Webster with five bas-
kets and Cummings stood out as the
stars of the contest.

Phi Beta Delta showing a good
fighting spirit but a poor eye for the
basket went down in defeat before
the Sigma Nu’s 21 to 9. Hoey with
five field goals and Koerber with two
were mainstays of the winners.

Frosh Heaves Shot
For Season’s Record

a

Clifford Strong, a freshman, broke
season’s record yesterday when he

five.

The Delta Sigs

with five were the
on the victorious

with a powerful

team left over from last winter
showed that they still have a power-
ful offense when they ran over the
Pi Lambda Phi’s 41 to 1. Gray and
Gaskill starred each sinking 6 count-
ers from the floor while the Ferris
Brothers notched four each.

heaved the shot 38 feet and 10 inches
to win his green shirt and a place on
the Frosh track team. Such an effort
often wins points in Conference meets.
In addition he cleared the ten foot
mark in the pole vault, another frosh
team requirement.

DOWN WITH THE DANCE

He limped about with halting steps
And filled the air with groans—
He stumbled and they heard him cry
In wild and angry tones—
‘‘No more will I attempt to try
To master this dance course,
I’ve strained the muscles in my legs—
I’ve got a Charleston horse! ?

“EXPERIMENT Upon Alarcon
Athletes With Violet Ray”—Maroon
headline. Fortunately it is against our
editorial policy to make puns.

Great Idea! But Who’ll Be Treasurer?
Dear Mr. Turk:

Please, what do you think of us con-
tributors organizing a club of our own?
Then I could get to know GeoG, Sis,
and all the other nice, little girls and
boys who write for my beloved Whis-
tle.

Lovingly yours,

—Little Jackie

The Co-ed

The co-ed had a tricking smile,
Her eyes were black as night,

And everywhere that woman went

She vamped with all her might.

She vamped the Prof in class one day
Which was against the rule—

The Prof just looked at her and said,
“I’ll see you after school.”

—Flamingo

A HUNTED look on the faces of
the freshmen; a lordly attitude on the
part of the upperclassmen; a strained
atmosphere about the house and cold
water in the bathtubs; school and in-
itiation season—obviously, a great dif-
ference between the literary bent, and
the fraternity bend.

ENUF’S ENOUGH
“Now,” said the math prof,
“You will assume the angle ...”
A sudden crash, and slam of
the door—the freshman in
the back part of the room
had left the class!

How About Masks

Dear Turk:

In view of the Maroon headline,
“Borneo Pygmies Without Beauty
Aids.” I make the following

(CITIZENS TO AID |
BUILDING DRIVE

(Continued from page 1)
doctrine secretions, hormones, vita-
mines in biological and physiological
chemistry; all have affected directly
and intensely the industrial life of
Chicago.

' “Before the war rare organic re-
search and laboratory chemicals came
almost entirely from Germany and
France. Today Chicago is the world
center for the production of many of
them. The world market for rare
sugars has been largely won by a
Chicago concern. Amine acids, of
which seventeen are known, are pro-
duced here for the entire world.
Chicago ranks third as a producing
center in the heavy chemical indus-
try, and second as a consuming cen-
ter.

Need Power, Raw Material, Food

“We need power for our industries,
raw material for our industries, food
for our workers, and medicine for all
of us. Whether we look at general
chemistry, physical chemistry, col-
loidal chemistry, or any other branch
of this pure science, there are gigan-
tic tasks waiting to be done.

“In the emphasis put upon gradu-
ate work and the development of
highly trained investigators and pro-
fessional experts, the University re-
presents in the Middle West both in
quality and purpose what the gradu-
ate schools of the great eastern uni-
versities, such as Harvard, Yale,
Columbia, and Johns Hopkins, and
the great universities of Europe,
stand for. The department of Chem-
istry at the University has easily held 1
its place among the leaders in the
highest type of effort for many years,
but it is now doubtful that it can do

this longer if it continues to be
peded by enforced economices
the lack of financial support.

Plan Ten Year*’ Research

“The plans of the department

the next ten years, if adequate finan-
cial support is given it, are directed
not only toward duplicating the re-
cent advances of eastern institutions,
but also toward research in chemistry
surpassing in certain respects the pre-
sent opportunities of the East.

“A committee of the American
Chemical Society, a few years ago,
elaborated a plan for a ten-million
dollar Chemo-Medical Institute of
Research, in which investigators in
the fundamental sciences, chemistry
and physics, would be working on the
great problems of medicine jointly
with medical research men. With

the erection of the Albert Merritt Bil-
lings Hospital and other medical
buildings at the University, and the
installation of the new medical de-
partments on a graduate and research
basis, the University will have on its
campus all the components necessary
for such intensive co-operative work
as presented by the proposed Chemo-
Medical Institute, provided the De-
partment of Chemistry is given the
opportunity to carry out its plans to
put itself on the same high plane as
the medical departments will be.
These plans involve the strengthen-
ing of the research staff by calling
leaders in their fields to new profes-
sorships, and providing a new labora-
tory to be devoted exclusively to gra-
duate and research work.”

resenting the same organization will
be allowed to meet before the final
events, and no one contestant may
wrestle in more than one class. How-

shortly. Baker of Seattle, who had
quite a “rep” on the coast is out for
wrestling. However, the yearlings
with a little more practice should
measure up to the standard of previous
freshman outfits.

OBSERVATION

They say that pygmies go without
All modern beauty aids.

In Borneo there is no need

For beautifying trades.

But that is not a real excuse—

My research work discloses

That campus girls aren’t cannibals
And still have shiny noses!

Please have it noted that this is
not dedicated or directed to anyone in
particular. This lad*is not taking any
chances!

Yours for powder puffs.

THE organization of a Whistle

might work out on campus. At North-
western their line fraternity holds reg-
ular meetings, elects officers, wears
pins, and probably chooses the column
conductor. Any ideas on the subject?
