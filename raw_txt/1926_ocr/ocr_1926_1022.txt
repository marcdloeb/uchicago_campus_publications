WHATo/ IT?

JOHN MEYER SKIPPER OF ’27

The announcement in yesterday’s
Maroon of the forthcoming activity
of the debating team has caused
numerous thoughts to swell up like
dough out of my head. (The oppor-
tunity I leave in that simile for my
esteemed friend, Terrible Turk, to
get off a cutting jibe of some sort or
other I am fully cognizant of. I
therefore anticipate Turk, and save
him the trouble of bothering.) The
main fault with Chicago debating
teams of the past, as I see it, was
that they did not stick purely to de-
bating (in the proper, or high school,
sense of the term), but attempted to
meet their opponents half-way in the
business of what we are inclined to
call “kidding”. The terrible result
of this was seen in the debate with
Oxford last year, when the Maroons
were driven to cover in a rout that
was as complete as the recent de-
bacle at Franklin Field.

•	• •

As long as the boys stuck to pure
reasoning, they at least kept the
score respectable. But Oxford’s
representatives, with a devilish cun-
ning, forced the Chicago men to
change their tactics in favor of an-
other sort of attack which they were
not sufficiently masters.of to work
smoothly. The English method of
debating was to take the argument
out of the realm of reasoning, and
make it the cause for a couple of
hours of gracious fooling. The result
of a few minutes of these tactics
was to cause the Maroon orators to
look mildly foolish. So, coming out
of the huddle after one of their
whispered consultations, our boys
adopted this same sort of offense.
They attempted to return tongue-
in-cheek for the same, but somehow
or other the Oxford cheeks bulged
out the farthest.

*	* *

And so the dear old debating team
fought, bled, but eventually died
just the same, for the cause. I do
not wish to see the debating team
fall into any such habit as has the
football athletes in its grip at
present. Hence, I counsel the boys
to stick to bona fide arguing, and to
leave the business of fooling to the
Oxford boys, and other ne’er-do-
wells like myself, who have nothing
better to do to occupy their time.
This is the best advice I have for
the debating team. I wish I had
known before the schedule was
drawn up that the University of
Sydney, Australia, and the Univer-
sity of California were the prospec-
tive Chicago foes. I should have
counseled against giving these
schools a place on the card. These
intersectional affairs always seem to
come out badly for us Chicago
fellows.

•	♦ ♦

I hear that some of the campus
frats are sending their boys off to
sing the old songs over the radio
Thursday nights. The idea is a good
one -in some ways. Many bald-
headed old grads of what the an-
nouncers jocularly term “th’ radio
audience” will have memories of
their more or less bright college days
wafted back to them again. Patient
wives, who have been forced for
years to hear the mutilated strains
of the “Sweetheart of Sigma Chi,”
“The Beta Blessing Song,” “We
Come,” “Now That We’re Here,”
etc., rising above the noise of the
rushing hot water during the morn-
ing period consecrated to the ghostly
office of shaving, will now be offered
an opportunity of hearing these
hymns sung in all their glory in the
way which they ought to be sung.
These are good—sufficiently good—
reasons for the singing of any fra-
ternity songs, which are usually sung
for no good reason at all, but well
up out of the night apparently with-
out provocation.

OFFICIALS NEED
TWO MILLION TO
SECURE BEQUEST

“A Significant Program of
Medical Education”—

Mason

A new medical school, one of the
most modern and complete in Ameri-
ca, which will provide hospital and
clinic as well as facilities for medical
study on a large scale in close prox-
imity to the established scientific de-
partments of the University was
launched on the Midway yesterday
with the announcement by President
Max Mason that a gift of $3,385,000
had been received from the General
Education Board of New York for the
support of a signficant medical project
on the south side of Chicago.

To meet the conditions of this gift
the University must secure an addi-
tional $2,000,000 for endowment of the
medical program.

Mason Cites Plan

President Mason in making the an-
nouncement called attention to the
magnitude of the medical program
which the University is about to in-
augurate with the opening of its Goth-
ic medical buildings covering two
square blocks on the Midway. The
project is one of the most significant
programs of medical education and
research ever attempted in America.
It will be partially supported by as-
sets brought up to $20,000,000 by the
recent gift. But if it is to succeed it
will need the generous support of
those able to give who see in Chicago
an opportunity for almost phenomenal
progress in medical sciences, President
Mason affirmed.

Establish Clinics

“Perhaps the most striking ’feature
of the program is the establish-
ment on the campus of the Univer-
sity of clinical departments which are
to function in the graduate school of
science,” Dr. Mason continued. “This
makes the medical sciences a definite
and integral part of the University
tying them up in a very effective way

HARSHE LOVES HIS
GREEN CAP’ DUTY

Sheridan’s ride fades Into mere
obscurity before a more notable de-
monstration by Bill Harshe, a Phi
Gam freshman. Bill, indisposed be-
cause of an injury yesterday was de-
termined not to miss the daily exer-
cises of the Green Cap Club, to
which he is an aspirant. Accord-
ingly, combining haste with a good
color combination, he sped to the
scene of festivities in a Yellow Cab
and limped across the Circle in time
to keep his record untarnished.

The upperclassmen say that such
spirit among the Freshmen is to be
commended.

Year Book Needs

Frosh Candidates

The chance still remains for
Freshmen to get a position on the
Cap and Gown. Those who are in-
terested in trying out should report
Monday at 4 to McGraw, business
manager at the Cap and Gown Office.

Paper Club Badges to Decorate
Shoreland Hotel for Honor Hop

Enlarged club pins surrounded by
the colors of the various women’s
clubs will decorate the ballroom of
the Shoreland hotel for the dance
given by Skull and Crescent and Score
club from 9 to 1 Friday, Oct. 29.

One dance will be dedicated to each
club represented and will be begun by
the new- pledges. Programs will be in
the shape of a Phoenix and will con-
tain besides the ordqr of the dances,
general information about the affair.
One of the main features of the eve-
ning’s entertainment will be adver-
tised at a pep session to arouse enthu-
siasm for the Ohio game on the fol-
lowing day. Refreshments of punch
and cake will be served.

Charlie Agnes’ band has been se-
cured through Walter Ford’s agency
and will supply the music for the eve-
ning. According to Ray Murphy,
president of Skull and Crescent, who
heard the orchestra play before it
was engaged, the music will be “red
hot.” It has also been announced by
the leaders of the two organizations
that further arrangements are near-
ing completion and that posters ad-
vertising the dance will appear on
campus today.

Murphy has urged upperclassmen
to turn out as well as underclassmen
and added that many freshmen have
purchased bids. Tickets are on sale
at the various fraternities and at the
University Bookstore. Ample check-
ing facilities nave neen assured by
the management of the hotel, acord-
ing to Robert Harman, president of
Score club. '

The preparations indicate that five
hundred couples will attend the
affair, breaking all quantity records
for University dances exclusive of
the Washington Prom. The new
Shoreland Hotel ballroom is the most
commodious site that could have
been chosen for the dance, Harmon
says, and the large number of dan-
cers will not crowd the floor.

James Root and William King. Bar-
bara Cook and Eunice Hill were a
weak second and third in the fight
for the vice-presidency.

WELCOME, FATHERS

THE enthusiasm with which plans for the first Fathers’ Day have
been received on the campus practically insures the success of
the event. There is every indication that there will be a goodly num-
ber of fathers at the University tomorrow to celebrate with their
sons and daughters.

Arrangements have been made for a tour of the campus in the
morning, the Chicago-Purdue football game in the afternoon, open
house at the Reynolds club and at fraternity houses after the game,
a dinner at 6 in Bartlett gymnasium and a student vaudeville show
in the evening in Mandel hall. Nothing has been left undone to
make the program pleasant for our visitors.

For the first time in many years the “C” section will be open
to others than ^University students. The fathers may obtain tickets
that will permit them to sit with their sons and daughters and with-
out the students having to purchase extra tickets.

The Daily Maroon welcomes the fathers to the campus.

SUNDAY, 8 O’CLOCK

THE DAILY MAROON, while frequently accused of being irre-
ligious and even unreligious, appears today with two full pages
of news concerning the activities of seventeen churches which have
in co-operation with the Y. M. C. A. attempted to interest students
in religious activity.

To those of us still under the parental roof, the appeal being
made by the local churches does no' touch. But to those from the
far off corners in Texas, or from dis’ant Maine or balmy California,
the call of the church brings with it a touch of home.

Public opinion enjoys and revels in accusing the student of
breaking away from ecclesiastical connections as soon as home bound#
are broken. Students may not boast of their church activities, may
not chalk up on the wall their church attendance record, but when
Sunday morning rolls around, the quiet atmosphere and serenity
which the clergy offers, if it does not always stimulate, is at least a
relief from an otherwise too full program.

But if the Sunday sermon cannot attract one, the innumerable
discussion and lecture clubs admitting University students, in fact
inviting University students, will help to form the religious side
of life.

Campus organizations, sponsored by churches, have grown in
number until every major denomination can lay claim to a strong
body of student followers. And their enthusiasm is manifest on the
bulletin boards, as we daily see announcements of their group
meetings.

But try staying away from church, for a month, or two, or
even more; you will soon find yourself creeping back, and bash-
fully taking a back pew, for the sake of once more experiencing
that incomparable serenity.

KING JONES OF
ARTIST COLONY
• DAMNS SOCIETY

By Al Widdifield

Down across the Chicago river in
the dark alley district there is an
isolated colony known as La Boheme.
It has a King whose name is Jack
Jones. All over this Lower North
Side realm his renegade writings and
strange court have brought him a
unique popularity.

I saw him the other evening in the
coffee house of the Dill Pickle club.
Jack is proprietor there. He stood
in the middle of the room with Edgar
Miller, an artist, looking over some
futuristic portraits the latter had just
scrawled on the walls. The sharp,
misshapen features of his face were
almost hidden under a tangled mass
of wirey hair. It could not have seen
a comb since his fourth wedding re-
cently. A tattered blue shirt, open at
the throat, was tucked into a pair of
short tuxedo trousers and although
he wore no socks at all a pair of
brand new patent leather oxfords
were on his feet. That is about all
one can really say about the personal
appearance of Jack, unless it is to
mention the three fingered left hand
with its peculiar knack of handling
a wood-carver’s pinion. Of course
there was that devil’s face of his—a
broad forehead tapering down to a
smooth sharp chin, an aquiline, beak-
like nose, and a pair of black eyes
that had a peculiar quality of eluding
you and seeing you at the same time.

TALKS ON HECHT

I walked over beside the two Bo-
hemians and began surveying the
portraits Edgar Miller had just
drawn.

“What do you think of them,” Jack
said, unexpectedly, in a shattered sort
of voice.

I looked at him. “Well, I’m not in
a position to judge—I don’t under-
stand them.” I had decided to be
frank. The three of us went over
and sat down between two board-
backs of built in benches. Jack leaned
over the middle of the table and
drummed a tattoo with two fingers of
a three fingered hand.

And so we talked, Edgar Miller
sitting there beside me humped up
and disinterested, Jack and I carried
on a meagre conversation. Somehow
I wanted to ask a lot of questions yet
didn’t know just how to approach
him. It was not until we began talk-
ing about Ben Hecht that Jack seemed
to get inspired.

“Hecht,” he said contemptuously,
“is a chit-wit, a radical young up-
start.”

“Know him well?” I asked.

“Know him? Well I ought to. It
was the club here that started him
out. Many a night I gave him food
when he was hungry, lodging when
he was weary, and encouragement
when it looked as if he would never
gain recognition. But he’s forgotten
us now. That’s the way. It never
pays, it never pays.”

JACK CYNICAL

, “You seem to have become quite
cynical.”

“Yes, thank God. Cynicism is the
only indication of a mature mental-
ity.”

“Do you believe that?” I asked.

“As much as I believe anything,”
he answered. “We must accept every-
thing with a grain of salt. We must
be consistenly pessimistic.”

Jack Jones was becoming philo-
sophical. That was what I wanted.
I looked over at Edgar Miller. He
had lit a cigarette and was puffing
contently.

“And society?” He looked at me
rather disgustedly.

“There is no such thing.”

A woman entered. I tried to catch
a glimpse of her as she stood some-
where over to my left in the gloom.
Jack whispered a word in my ear.

“Goodbye”— -

'Ui - .

OFF THE SHELF

Mr. Van Doren bases the scheme of
the “Ninth Wave” on the analysis’of
John Thane’s “Drama and Melo-
drama” who in criticising the trend of
contemporary fiction asserts that “A
very few thoughts that man has had
may explain his career more accurate-
ly than any possible number of hap-
penings chosen from it could do. 1
keep waiting for a novel, though I
have never read one, which will go
behind events to impulses, resolutions,
convictions which mark the essential
life of man.”

One would suppose that the whole
technicality of this novel would lack
interest, vitaliy, and harmonious pre-
sentation of events since its ultimate
object is psychological and sociologi-
cal instead of the romantic and super-
ficial drift of our ‘best sellers ’ Much
praise is due to Mr. Van Doren’s
style which sweeps along in a majes-
tic course eliminating superfluous de-
scriptions, events, and inner-most pas-
sions which is given to the reader to
imagine what he will.

Van Doren’s Plot

The story opens with the leading
character, Kent Morrow, winning a
horse race, the ambition of every boy
in the small town of Charity. This is
Ken’t first conquest of that overwhel-
ming attainment, success. Returning
from abroad after a college education
Kent accepts a teaching position in a
great university. In becoming one of
the Lords of the Treadmill he discov-
ers his need of youthful association—
this he finds in Margaret Peyton whom
he marries. After twenty years of ar-
duous labors he is awarded the gden
prize for the most scholarly book of
historical - research. This is the ninth
wave, the culmination of hopes, striv-
ings. and ambitions which marks the
zenith of success.

On the whole Mr. Van Doren ex-
emplifies the tendency of modern real-
ism but there is a great gap which
needs to be bridged. No obstacle op-
erates against the achievements of
Kent. We are lead to form our own
conceptions of his trials and labors.
Kent is presented to the reader only
at the climax of each advancement.
This defect in the realistic treatment
of Kent is indeed unpardonable from
the pen of Mr. Van Doren whose fiery
attacks against improbable results is in-
deed not forgotten.

STILL WATERS

The national prohibition question is
soundly rated in August Thomas’ new
three-act play, “Still Waters.” The
story is that of a United States sena-
tor’s campaign for re-nomination. It
revolves around the means used by
the prohibitionists to force the state-
ment of his stand on the enforcement
of the Volstead Act. The love story
of his daughter and the attache of the
British ambassador is cleverly inter-
woven, but the play as a whole is rath-
er overdraws.

Mr. Thomas’ style reminds one
very much of Galsworthy, in his choice
of subject, treatment and general at-
titude. The book is unusual because
the rather long preface is as interest-
ing as the book itself. A clever simile
is used in the statement that the hon-
esty of a man is handcuffs is not a
virtue, it is an hypothesis.

JORGENSEN

The extension of the railroad in
many devious paths over Western des-
erts and through long tunnels, has
brought down upon the society of the
last three decades a deluge of a cer-
tain type of undesirable local color
story. Tristam Tupper’s “Jorgensen”
however, does not run true to the pat-
tern of the usual railroad tale, for
there was no opportune signalling of
a train as it rounded the last curve be-
fore a washout, and no foreman’s
grandchild was snatched from the
tracks just as Number 13 sped by.

“For millions of years this mountain
stood inert, immutable; this river flow-
ed on and on. Then came men. They
laid hold with their hands, their minds,
their wills; they laid hold with their
lives." And with these men came Jor-
gensen,—gaunt, with a scar across his
life. He conquered the mountain and
completed the tunnel through its huge
mass, and yet he could not overcome
the results of the treacheries, the per-
fidities, the wiles and ways of his fel-
low men.

Offer Variety in

New Non-Fiction

The physical and social sciences,
philosophy, education, theology ana
language have formed the subject
matter for recent University Press
publications. All the books have
been writen by University professors
preeminent in their respective fields.

“The Nature of the World and of
Man,” the product of sixteen mem-
bers of the University faculty, is an
outline of our knowledge of the
physical and the biological world,
and man’s position in it. Beginning
with the story of life from the origin
of the earth to the point where man
is defined as man, each of the six-
teen authors has described that
phase of development with which ho
is most familiar.

THE DEMOCRATIC WAY OF LIFE

“The Democratic Way of Life” is
the title of T. V. Smith’s book whose
basic questions are democracy’s di-
rection, its ideals, its compatibility
with actual human nature and con-
crete circumstance. Henry C. Mor-
rison’s “Practice of Teaching in the
Secondary School” is a book for ad-
ministrators by an administrator,
and for teachers by one who has
spent twenty-five years in the ex-
perimental study of teaching.

RELIGIOUS BOOKS

Several new religious and theo»^
ical books have appeared, of which
probably the most interesting is
“The Formation of the New Testa-
ment” by Edgar J. Goodspeed. Here
the well-known translator of tb*
New Testament has stressed wc
geographical influences that played
so large a part in assemoiing the
books of the Testament. A conec-
tion of the addresses of the late
Ernest DeWitt Burton has been
made since his death and published
under the heading “Christianity in
the Modem World.” *

PAN-HELLENIC SHOWS
ANNOUNCEMENTS OF
SORORITY PLEDGING

Following the lead of the National
Pan-Hellenic Council, a a sorority at
the University of Minnesota, will not
announce their pledges this year.
This is the initial move to shun pub-
licity, which the groups have agreed
to avoid on minor social functions
during the year. The same idea has
been followed somewhat at Beloit
College. During freshman week,
when there are many functions spon-
sored by the upper-classwomen for the
purpose of becoming acquainted with
the new class, sorority pins are
abandoned by the members. Thus a
spirit of friendliness may prevail be-
tween all the women, unbiased by the
knowledge of the sorority to which
one may belong. All the women are
required to reside in the women’s
halls, a fact which tends to eliminate
a certain element of cliqueishness
which is bound to arise if the groups
isolate themselves.

Elizabeth Graham, president of In-
ter-club Council and a member of
Wyvern, when questioned on this idea
for the ^omen of the University, said,
“The plans adopted by the University
of Minnesota and Beloit College might
well be considered by the women at
the University of Chicago. We all
feel that the feeling of distinction
between club and non-club women
should be eliminated as far as pos-
sible.”

Coins Give Clues
To Vanished Ages

“Coins are often the only authentic
records we have of vanished stages
cago Archeological Society, at the
University.

Mr. Noe brought out the fact that
most of the coins, though they are
thousands of years old, are found in
a wonderfully preserved condition,
secreted in vases or jugs and buried
under the sites of ancient battlefields.
The lecturer showed slides of coins
from various ancient countries and
ages.

Are University Men
Good Golfers?—No

“ ’S awful. ’S terrible!”

“Most University student golfers
ought to be. shot at sunrise,” the
outraged golf starter informed us.
“Some of them don’t even know
what a divot is.” We trembled at
his ravings; we didn’t know what a
divot was either.

“A lot of University men come
here at the busiest times and expect
to tee off for a game immediately.
Just because they know I’m a Uni-
versity man—” He was interrupted
just then by the appearance of a
young man.

The young man’s shiney golf
clubs and his nice clean bag were
obviously new. “Don’t sign until
your play is called,” snapped the
starter. “Another young cub from
your school.” Sarcasm.

Silence reigned as we watched
the eager players. The accused stu-
dents weren’t Pavlovas but they
weren’t so bad either, we didn’t
think. Our meditations were inter-
rupted by the golf starter himself.
“Don’t forget your ticket, sir,” he
was calling kindly to a hurrying
player.

We looked accusingly at him and
drawled in triumph, “We-ell?” The
starter grinned, “Oh, he wasn’t from
your school.”

We left. We knew his opinion
of student golfers.

SOCIALL Y SPEAKING

Delta Upsilon is having a houes
warming party this afternoon from 4
to 6. It is in celebration of the open-
ing of their new house. The D. U.'s
have moved from 58th and Blackstone
to 57th and Woodlawn where they
will be right among the other fraterni-
ties. We hope their new house is very
satisfactory, and that their party to-
day is a success.

Delta Tau Delta is having a house
dance tonight and Mr. and Mrs. Gor-
don Smith will chaperone the party.

Saturday is a big day on the social
calendar for this week. Tea dances and
evening parties are numerous. Maybe
the Purdue game is partly responsible.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Alpha
Tau Omega are giving tea dances after
the game Saturday. We are glad to
see that these affairs are becoming in-
creasingly popular. Tea dancing is
something that is all too rare in Chi-
cago.

Delta Sigma Club is having a dance
Saturday night. It is to be held in
Ida Noyes theater, and wc hear it’s
going to be a good party.

There’s going to be a party at the
Alpha Sigma Phi house Saturday night
that sounds pretty good. The house
will be decorated is green and white,
and there will be green caps for favors.
Our informant did not say whether
or not the wearers of these caps would
be required to carry out the tradition
of the caps. Bill Hahn’s orchestra
will play. His music has been good
at mixers, and he will probably surpass
himself for the brethren.

The members of Delta Sigma Phi
are having a busy week-end. A house
dance Saturday night and a tea for
their parents on Sunday. Such energy
is astounding. We should think one
party a week would be enough for
anybody.

GLOOMY MAROON

OUTLOOK WORSE

Midway Harriers To Open Season
/With Quadrangle Meet Tomorrow

Boilermakers Drill
At Two O’Clock

Loss of Regulars In Last
Minute Blow To

Midway Hope*

On the eve of the conference open-
er with Purdue all is not rosy in the
Maroon camp. It was announced yes-
terday that McKinney, regular half,
and Lewis, regular tackle will not play
Saturday. Also that it is very prob-
lematical whether Hoerger and Free-
man, substitute ends, will be able to
play due to ankle injuries. Freeman
twisted his ankle in last night’s scrim-
mage.

McKinney is still out with injuries
that have been with him since the op-
ening of the season, while Lewis is
confined to bed with an attack of ton-
silitis.

Frosh Outplay Varsity

On top of this the Maroons who
will play have been having in discour-
aging fashion throughout the week.
Night after night the freshman team
has been outplaying the varsity and
last night was no exception. The frosh
employing Purdue plays and with
Fritz Crisler bolstering the backfield
swept over Stagg's regulars in alarm-
ing fashion. The varsity attack failed to
get anywhere against the crack fresh-
men. So unless Purdue is a lot worse
than the yearlings the Maroons will not
accomplish very much on Saturday,
unless the Old Man’s oratory inspires
them to bigger and better things as it
has done in the past.

Signal Drill Today

The scrimmage was most likely the
last for the week for the team has
worked hard and there is a possi-
bility of staleness.

Coach Phelan and his dangerous
Boilermaker squad will arrive on
the Midway at noon today, and they
have made arrangements to use
Stagg Field for their final practice
at 2 o’clock this afternoon.

Many fans from Lafayette were
in town already yesterday afternoon
anxious for the big game. Five or
six special trains are to bring
around 5,000 more Hoosier enthu-
siasts this afternoon and tomorrow
morning.

HAWKS HAVE IT

TOUGH AT OHIO

IOWA CITY, la., Oct. 22.—Iowa’s
football team, backed by the unsul-
lied record of Hawkeye teams against
Ohio State is ensconsed today at
Columbus, the home of the Buckeye.

Thirty-one hours of rest after the
600 mile railroad jaunt will put the
Hawkeyes in fine shape for the sec-
ond conference game of the season.
A light drill Friday afternoon in the
Buckeye stadium is a further con-
ditioner.

Warning that the current Ohio
State team closely resembles those
which made a romp of the Big Ten
race in 1916, 1917 and 1920 has been
given by the Buckeye’s sensational
victory over Columbia last week.

Passes which caused Iowa’s down-
fall in the Illinois game will not suc-
ceed so easily this week if the cauti-
ous Hawkeye defense functions prop-
erly.

Saturday morning at 10 o’clock
the Maroon cross country team will
make its 1926 debut in a quadrangle
meet with Wisconsin, Indiana and
Northwestern over the two ana .
half mile course in Center play-
ground at Washington park, starting
just west of 55th street.

Chicago will be represented by
Hitz, Hegowick, Williams, Burke,
Jackson and another man yet to be
selected by coaches A. A. Stagg, Sr.,
A. A. Stagg, Jr., and Walter Bowers.

Wisconsin, conference champion
for the past two years, will bring
Captain Schutt, Chapman, Petaja,
Gumbreck and Zola, all members of
former championship teams, here for
the run.

Indiana has a star in Rose and
Northwestern is pinning its hopes on
Garby and his teammates.

After the long distance run
Coaches Frank Hayes, of Indiana and
Tom Jones, of Wisconsin, will attend
the Chicago-Purdue game with their
teams, as guests of the university.
The Northwestern runners will re-
turn to Evanston to attend the Notre
Dame-Northwestern football game.

The first man finishing will be
numbered ‘one’ and the others in
the order of completion. The team
with the lowest total will be winner.

Following the main event a race
between teams representing Coach
Stagg, Jr’s 11:15 cross country class
and Coach Bowers’ 5:30 class will be
run over the course.

Both Bands Play
At Game; Chicago
In Collegiate Style

It will be a battle between bands as
well as football teams tomorrow when
Chicago meets Purdue. The renowned
Boilermaker Band of 100 pieces is to
accompany the team and be on deck
for Purdue any celebrating that may
be in order following the grid team.

Along with this appearance of the
first foreign band to invade Stagg
Field this season will be the appear-
ance of the newly outfitted Chicago
Band. Brand new maroon-colored
sweaters, white pants and snappy ma-
roon ties will give the Midway outfit
a real “Collegiate” style. In addition,
the local band will have it’s four-man
“world’s largest” drum on hand when
they parade the field.

Purdue’s music makers will paiade
the downtown district in the morning
before coming to Stagg Field.

TICKETS AVAILABLE
FOR SATURDAY GAME

Plenty of tickets are yet available
for those wishing to attend the Pur-
due game, says A. A. Stagg, Jr., who
anticipates at least 45,000 to attend. If
this number of football fans are there
it will be the largest crowd that ever
attended a game at Stagg Field.

All Freshman football men have the
same privileges as those holding C
books and will be able to purchase tic-
kets to the Northwestern game for
$1.00, the Football Tickets Committee
announced today.

PHI PSI, PSI U,D.U., EXHIBIT
MID-SEASON FORM IN TOUCHBALL

WINS; Z. B. T., KAPPA SIGS, TIE

Large Scores and Long Runs Characterize Day’s Play; Root,
Sherubel, Watrous, Gist and
Farwell Star

By Bob Stern

There was much running up and
down and much swinging of arms at
the touchball games yesterday after-
noon, both on the field, where the play
was fast, and on the sidelines where
the wind was cold and cutting. In
spite of the cold, the contests were
fast and furious, and many of the
teams exhibited mid-season form.

D. U.’s Win

Phi Pi Phi and Delta Upsilon play-
ed one of the closest games of the
day with the D. U.’s finally winning
out, 12 to 6. For their first touch-
down the D. U. outfit tried a number
of short passes and put the ball over
the line in short order after a whole
series V 15 yard gains. Root of the

Phi Pi’s made a sensational 90 yard
run on the next kick-off and on the
next play Kraft carried the ball to a
touchdown.

Zeta Betes Tie Kappa Sigs

The most exciting game of the ses-
sion, however, was the Zeta Beta Tau-
Kappa Sigma battle which raged thru
two overtime periods to a scoreless
tie. Both teams played tight ball and
the forwards seemed to be all over the
field with the ball. Sherubal and Hoke
of the Kappa Sigs displayed rare end
running ability: Metzenberg, Kir-
schiemer and Kramer starred for the
Zeta Bete’s.

Psi U. S Win Again

church affiliation but who have
a desire for help in their spir-
itual and moral problems this
church gives a particular invi-
tation. It seeks to help—that
is its purpose.

“The Hyde park Congrega-

S. Patton, formerly minister of the
First Congregational church of Los
Angeles, will be the preacher at the

comes to the Congregational church
here after a long pastorate in the
First Congregational church of Mari-
etta, Ohio.

During the war, he served with the
Y. M. C. A. in the army camps of this
country and in France. All of his pas-
torates have been in college communi-
ties and in churches that drew very
largely on such communities for
membership. In Manhattan, Kansas,
he had charge of Congregational stu-
dent work at the Kansas State Agri-
cultural College. At Topeka, where
he was assistant to Dr. Charles M.
Sheldon, the Central church was
again a “college church,” being near
the campus of Washburn college. The
Marietta church, of which he has
been pastor for seven years, played
an important part in the life of Mari-
etta college.

Mr. Goldsmith was an honor gradu-
ate at Washburn college in 1908 and
of Union Theological Seminary, New
York, in 1912. Of his choice of career
he says:

“I cannot remember when I was
not going to be a minister. My par-
ents insist that my first congrega-
tion as a little fellow was my small
sister and her numerous dolls, and I
can remember preaching to the chick-
ens many times as a boy, to the
disturbance of the flock hut to my
great satisfaction.

To Its Meetings

The following statement, printed '
on its weekly Calendar, expresses !
the spirit and ideals of the Univer-
sity Disciples of Christ church: This
Church practices Christian union;
has no creed; seeks to make religion
as intelligent as science; as appeal-
ing as art; and as vital as the day’s
work.

The young people’s organization
: whose members are largely students
j is known as The Wranglers. They
have a class, taught by Dr. Ames,
from 12:20 to 1:00 on Sundays. A

dancing and other forms of recre-
ation.

Students are also invited to the
monthly meetings of the Social Ser-
vice Council, the Arts Club and to
the dinners served at one o’clock on
Sundays. The sermons on Sunday
morning at eleven frequently, deal
, with the problems which are of spe-
cial interest to those seeking to
understand and participate in re-
ligion in ways consistent witn tnc
outlook and experiences of conegi
men and women. The music is in
charge of Mr. Basil F. Wise. Miss
Clarinda Brower is the Church Sec-

this church. The student committee
of the church has issued the follow-
ing statement:

“We know that you will add much
to your knowledge while taking ad-
vantage of the superior opportun-
ities found in your well equipped
school, and ere long you will be
ready to take your place in the work
of the world.

“But this is not enough—the rent
issues of life are in the realm of
ideals, purposes and motives. We
hope that your sympathies will be
aroused, your vision greatly en-
larged and your ideals advanced.
In other words, we believe that with
head knowledge, you will also want
heart knowledge.

“So we invite you to make the
church your headquarters during
your student days. You will be
charmed with the new and beautiful
edifice where the spirit of worship
pervades. You will like the music
and the service. Every Sunday at
6 you may enjoy tea and good fel-
lowship with the Luther league. This
, is the best possible way to get ac-
j quainted, for it would be difficult to
find a place where one could meet
a hundred such delightful young peo-
ple. The devotional meeting and
j discussion forum at 6:45 will give
i you the right start for the week’s
I work.

Personality Will Be Discussed by

Von Ogden Vogt Sunday Morning

“Names, Tags, Labels and signs’’
is the subject of the sermon to stu-
dents on next Sunday morning at the
First Unitarian church. It is not
meant as a facetious discussion but
as a searching inquiry into some of
the meanings of personality and of
the relations of persons to the social
forces of the times.

The Unitarian church is one of the
nearest to the University. Its beauti-
ful Gothic chapel is at the corner of
Woodlawn avenue and Fifty-seventh
street. Yet it is also one of the old-
est churches in the city of Chicago,
having been established in 1836. As
early as 1840, it erected its first meet-
ing house in Washington street. For
many years it worshipped in a Gothic
church on Michigan boulevard at
Twenty-third street. Although de-
pleted in numbers by the encroach-
ments of business before the move to
the University neighborhood, its pres-
ent life is vigorous and promising.

The Unitarian church is the liberal
branch of the original Congregational
body of New England, the Pilgrim-
Puritan movement. It happens, how-
ever, that the University preacher for

select any one for their own needs.
The Triangle class taught by Mr.
Burhorn, is enrolling young men

parish which was originally an An-
glican church, King’s Chapel, Boston.
There are said to be more Unitarian
! names, proportionally, in ’’Who’s
j Who” than of any other body.

The special ideal of the First
Church, briefly, to to unite the en-
tire open-mindedness of the most lib-
•eral religious thought with the richer

and warmer use of the arts which has
characterized the older bodies. It be-
lieves that a great national culture is
founded on a noble and comprehen-
sive cult, a joy in itself, inspiring
free thought and high ethics.

On four afternoons each week,
Tuesday through Friday, at 5:30, the
regular vespers of Meadville The-
ological School are held in the Uni-
tarian church. These services are

appeal to those who value a brief
worship service without an address—
though not without ideas.

club, followed by a discussion open to
all. The club is the student organ-
ization of Unitarian and other religi-
ous liberals. Visitors are welcome.

terian Church to which all students of

the University wild arc interested are

St. Paul Tower
on Midway

The tower of St. Paul’s Universal-
i ist church looms across the Midway as j
an invitation and a challenge to Uni-
versity students. St. Paul’s not only
serves as a church home and a place
of worship for many young people,
but it also invites them to have a
part in a coinunity center which
reives hundreds of young people
every week. St. Paul’s gives them an
opportunity for growth and all-round
self-expression.

I Dr. L. Ward Brigham, minister of
I St. Paul’s, has chosen for next Sun-
| day’s topic, “What’s the Use of an
Education?’’ which will be of interest

I to all students who enjoy a thoughful
j and careful presentation.

More than eighty years ago, near
j the corner of Clark and Washington
streets, St. Paul’s church was first
built. As Chicago grew, developing I
from a hamlet of a few thousand to
a throbbing city, the home of millions,
St. Paul’s Universalist church has
built new plants in five different lo-1
cations, always endeavoring to keep
close to the people, ever serving in the
upbuilding of the community.

Established “on the Midway” in
1918, St. Paul’s has made itself a
vital force in the community, and is
well known as one of Chicago’s lead-
ing liberal protestant churches.

Nothing is much good which is not
god for daily use. A Christianity
that really counts in the lives of men
and women is one that finds expres-
sion in action seven days a week.

OBTAIN PAMPHLETS

C. A. office. It contains information
for those interested in the student
attitude toward the church.

MODERN CHURCH
FOR ST. JAMES

COSTS FORTUNE

Gym, Social Halls, Kitchen
Included in Building

Equipment

St. James Methodist Episcopal
church has recently completed a new
type of modern church building at
the approximate cost of $500,000. One
of the reasons given for the erection
of a building of thisdiind was that it
could be used to more adequately
serve the young people of the com-
munity, institutions, schools, and col-
leges. In this beautiful church. Uni-
versity students will find complete
provision made for their welfare,
both intellectual and social. The
building includes social halls, well
equipped kitchen and dining rooms,
and a gymnasium with lockers and
showers.

Young people's societies for both
social and religious studies are main-
tained. Chief among these is the
Epworth League, with an attendance
of well over a hundred, which meets
each Sunday night at 6:30. The Ep-
worth League devotional services are
preceded by an afternoon tea and
social hour at 5:30. to which all Uni-
versity students are invited. Sunday
morning Bible classes of the School
of Religious Education meet at 9:30.
Mr. Brittenham’s class for young
men had an attendance of fifty last
.Sunday, while the class for young
women, conducted by his sister, Miss
Brittenham, had three more than this
present.

St. James church pulpit is credited
with an enviable record. Such men
as Bishops Robert McIntyre, William
A. Quayle, Charles B. Mitchell, and
Theodore S. Henderson have occupied
pastorates here. Dr. William R. Wed-
derspoon has just closed a ten year
ministry and is followed by Dr. Kirk
D. Beach, who comes to St. James
from a long pastorate at the First
Methodist church in Grand Rapids,
Mich. Mr. Beech graduated as a
bachelor of arts from Albion college
in 1905 and in 1921 he received the
degree of doctor of divinity from the
same school. After graduation, he
spent one year at the University of
Pennsylvania and two years at Co-
lumbia university, specializing in
psychology, economics, and sociology.
He was granted his master of arts
degree from the University of Penn-
sylvania.

Several of his congregation have
stated that his sermons, both morn-
ing and evening, show keen insight
into the problems of modern life and
are analytical and logical, refreshing
as well as helpful to the trained mind.
They believe that University students
will find in the services at St. James
a spirit of deep devotion, fine music,
and sermons of a high order.

CHRISTIAN SOCIETIES
COOPERATE TO PLAN
STUDENTS’ CHURCH

The two Christian associations,
working through a committee headed
by Miss Olsen of the Y. W. C. A.
and Mr. Steiger of the Y. M. C. A.
and representatives of the Denomi-
national groups on campus are pro-
moting a special Student Church
Sunday.

Roth groups are vitally concerned
in developing genuine interest in
church life, this being one expres-
sion of their interest.

Mr. Steiger came to the campus
from Elmhurst College where he had
considerable experience in young
peoples’ work. He was a delegate to
the Evanston Student Conference
last Christmas and was appointed as
a member of the Continuation Com-
mittee. During the fall quarter he
has been active, becoming ac-
quainted with the work of the de-
nominational groups and the young
peoples’ societies in the local
churches.
