FRANKIE REVIEWS
SYMPHONY CONCERT

By Alfred V. Frankenstein

I'he two most important composers
of modern Germany were represented
on the program of the symphony con-
cert played at Mandel hall yesterday
afternoon. Both were represented by
early works, each for a small section
of the orchestra.

Richard Strauss’ serenade for wind
instruments was written when Strauss
was imitating Brahms. The serenade
imitates Brahms' best mood—a
dreamy Sunday afternoon mood, the
mood the “Student Prince” attempts
so valiantly to capture, when it
achieves sentimentality.

The tone poem “Transfigured
Night” for strings, was written by Ar-
nold Schoenberg when he was under
the influence of Gustav Mahler, “Gus
the Grandiloquent” as he has irrever-
ently been called. Like the works of
Mahler, it has a deep program, de-
scribing as it does a man forgiving
his wife's adultery while walking
through a forest.

NOMINATE FOR

COUNCIL TODAY

Juniors Announce Candidates
for Honor Commission

Candidates will be nominated this
morning in junior chapel for member-
ship on the Undergraduate council.

Two men and two women will be
elected from the nominees this year,
where as formerly two men and one
woman were elected. The elections
will be held on March 2.

Nominations for positions on the
Honor Commission were announced
by that body today. The nominees
are: from the sophomore class, Elea-
nor Wilkins, Helen King. Earl Baker,
and Ted Lockard; from the junior
class, Dorothy Kennedy. Ruth Burtis.
Parker Hall and Ben Goble.

Nominations for positions' on the
Undergraduate council will be made
from the floor, or may be made by
petition after chapel.

I. S. A. CELEBRATES
INTERNATIONAL NIGHT

IN MANDEL, FRIDAY

International Night will be held by
the members of the International Stu-
dents’ association Friday at 8 in Man-
del hall. The affair will be celebrated
on a much larger scale than the one
held just before Christmas, according
to H. Y. Cho. president of the organ-
ization.

A program consisting of vocal se-
lections. instrumental music, and read-
ings will be presented at this time.
A three act tableau will be presented
called ‘‘International Night.” The
tableau will be concerned with the ex-
periences of a foreign student at the
University. The first act will picture
his lonesomeness, the second will deal
with his becoming connected with the
I. S. A., and the last will portray his
happiness at finding friends and a wel-
come in the organization. Further de-
tails will be announced in a later edi-
tion of The Daily Maroon. It is
planned, however, to secure the best
entertainment in the form of student
talent which is available.

Tickets may be purchased for fifty
cents from members of the cabinet of
the organization, or at the University
Bookstore, or the Y. W. C. A. and
Y. M. C. A. offices. All those who are
interested in the organization have
been urged to attend, continued Cho,
as the evening promises to be both
interesting and entertaining.

FROSH, SOPHS
HOLD ANNUAL

PROM APRIL 9

Chicago Beach Hotel Is
Chosen for Spring

Formal

Social activities for the Spring quar-
ter will commence on April 9, the eve-
ning of the Freshman-Sophomore
Prom. The councils of the two classes
decided upon this date for the annual
dance sometime last week. The Chi-
cago Beach Hotel has been selected
as the probable location on account
of its spacious promenade.

Announce Music Later

So far no suggestions as to the
music have been brought forward, but
Paul Lewis, president of the Sopho-
more class, assures all those who will
be present that no expense will be
spared to secure the best possible. It
is also unknown what entertainment
will be afforded, hut a committee has
been selected to consider the matter
and an announcement will be made in
the Maroon as soon as conclusions are
reached. Members of the Sophomore
council realize from their recent ex-
perience with the Skull and Crescent
dance that adequate checking facilities
are requisite to the success of the
dance and are taking action to see that
they are available.	*-'

Success Last Year

Last year the Hyde Park hotel was
the scene of a very successful ball
which ended in a gala affair with con-
fetti and streamers, affording a splen-
did environment and thus completing
the pleasure of the evening.

WHEREIN THE WOMEN
DISCUSS THEIR IDEA

OF PROFESSIONALISM

Is college a fitting preparation for
a woman going into business?

According to Mr. W. B. Towsley.
Assistant General Superintendent of
Marshall Field and Co., the average
woman is not looking forward to a
career, whereas the college woman
feels that she must realize on the
money that has been invested in her
education.

“The greatest fault of college wom-
en is their lack of patience.” Mr.
Towsley went on to say. “The col-
lege graduate is four years be'mifl the
high school graduate in her business
education.

“The college trainig lies in the
greater adaptability which it makes
possible. Therefore although it is
necessary for the college graduate to
begin on the same footing with the
woman of less education, her greater
experience will enable her to advance
relatively faster.”

This talk is one of a series now be-
ing given on “The Graduate Activities
of the College Woman.” Further lec-
ture titles will be announced in later
editions of The Daily Maroon.

The consensus of opinion at the
meeting seemed to he that college
training was of value to the business
woman.

COMPLETE FIESTA
PLANS AT MEETING

Plans for the Spanish Fiesta to be
given under the auspices of El Cir-
culo Espanol will be completed at
the meeting of the club today at 4:30
in the north reception room of Ida
Noyes hall. The discussion will be
followed by a program and refresh-
ments.

Tickets for the fiesta may be pro-
cured from Yolanda Simiz, president
of the club, Mary Ternsted and G.,
A. Fiorez. !

WASHINGTON’S PROM
RELEGATED TO PAST

Well, it’s over.

The Father of His Country, tem-
porarily disinterred to furnish the
spirit to 700 dancing feet at the thirty-
second annual Washington Promen-
ade, has returned to bis secluded home
in Paradise, haunted by such phan-
toms as “I Love My Baby,” “Sweet
Man,” and “That Certain Party.”

With the blare of Mr. Ralph Wil-
liam’s orchestra at 10 o’clock. 350
couples of the University’s most so-
cially active began the Grand March,
led by two men in faultless formal
costume, with their partners in gowns
that complemented with their charm
the dignity of the ebony-clad escorts.
“Collegiate!” howled the trumpets,
moaned the saxes, and shrieked the
clarinets, while the procession wended
its snail’s pace way about the ball-
room.

At midnight the crowd sated its ap-
petite at what the writer considered
a highly commendable supper, after
which dancing was resumed until 1
o’clock, when an enterprising “ex-’26”
appeared with Patricia Ann Manners,
of “The Student Prince,” the inimit-
able George Givot, and Dorothy Rae,
of the “Gay Paree” company.

And the seven hundred youths and
maidens snatched capes and coats and
departed in a long procession of cars.

Prof. Chamberlin
Has New Origin
of Earth Theory

Prof. T. C. Chamberlin, University
geologist, who with Prof. F. R. Moul-
tod. of the Chicago astronomy depart-
ment, developed the planetesimal hy-
pothesis of the origin of the earth,
has given a new interpretation to the
construction and present condition of
the earth.

Our planet, he says, is better or-
ganized and stronger today than eve!
before, and the reorganizing processes
show no signs of exhaustion. The con-
tinents. stand on solid foundation.
I hey do not float hydrostatically.

The earth is a heterogeneous elastic
solid inclosed in a riveted jacket which
has been for ages forming about itself
from worn and weatnered surface ma-
terial reshaped and bound together by
exudations from within.

1 he most vital agency in the recon-
struction of the earth is the reorgan-
.ization of its heterogeneous material.
I hese reorganizing processes show no
signs of wearing out.

Prof. Chamberlin observes, in elab-
oration: “The inte’nor of uTe earth is
no longer a realm of darkness and
mere speculation. Three lines of spe-
cific evidence now penetrate it. While
their full import is not yet at com-
mand. important light has already
been shed on the tectonic, or architec-
tural state of the interior.

LAW SCHOOL WILL
HAVE ENTERTAINERS
AT ANNUAL SMOKER

Smoke will cloud the atmosphere of
the Reynolds club theatre tomorrow
at 8 p. m. when the law students con-
vene for their annual Law smoker,
which is the one all-law social affair
of the year. Profs. Hinton and Bog-
ert will be the speakers for the faculty.

This year's Law’ Smoker will be
featured by a heavyweight wrestling
match between Clarke, of the wrest-
ling team, and Hunter, both law stu-
dents. Many other hisfrionic and
athletic feats as well as intramural and
vocal music will add to the entertain-
ment of those present.

Boucher Confined
To Home With
Attack of Grippe

Prof. Chauncey S. Boucher, Acting
Dean of the Colleges, has been con-
fined to his home since last Saturday,
suffering from a moderate case of
grippe.

Since his temporary assumption of
the duties of Dean Ernest Hatch Wil-
kins, who was forced to relinquish his
position last month after suffering a
nervous breakdown, Dean Boucher
has taken up most of the official work,
and a general weakened condition sub-
jected him to the grippe which has
been prevalent this winter.

After leaving his office Saturday,
Dean Boucher felt ill, and. upon ar-
riving at his home, took to bed. He
has been feeling better, however, and
is able to execute many of his duties
by telephone.

"Mr. Boucher will return to school
today or tomorrow,” said Mrs. Bouch-
er early today. “He has not been
seriously ill.”

ASK CHURCHMEN
TO CONFERENCE

Expect Over Five Hundred to
Be Present

How churches can cooperate for the
good of society in the questions of
marriage and divorce, prohibition and
crime will be discussed at the inter-
seminary conference held at the Uni-
versity, Thursday, February 25, under
the auspices of the University divinity
school and the Chicago theological
seminary. About 500 students from
seminaries in Chicago. Illinois, and rhe
adjoining states are expected to be
present.

Dr. Shaikr Mathews, dean of the
divinity school at die Uniw-dty of
( hicago, will address a banquet .at
6:15 on “The Minister of the Fu-
ture,” and Rev. Reinhold Neibuhr, of
Detroit, Michigan, the .afternoon ses-
sion on “An Aggressive Faith.” All
Chicago ministers have been extended
an invitation to attend the meetings,
by members of the conference.

hr the 'morning session discussion
groups will consider, "Ways and
Means of Church Cooperation.”
“Church Cooperation with Respect to
Marriage and Divorce,” “Church Co-
operation with Respect to Prohibi-
tion, ’ “( hurch Cooperation with Re-
spect to Crime ” The last group will
be led by Prof. E. W. Burgess,, Uni-
versity sociologist.

WOMEN TO PRESENT
“BOOSTING BRIDGET”

AT SPEAKERS CLUB

“Boosting Bridget,” a one act
comedy by Elizabeth Grieg will be
presented by the Women’s Speakers
club at an open meeting tomorrow
at 7 in the theater of Ida Noyes hall.
The following women will take part
in the play: Bridget, Catherine
Moore; Jane Brewster, Frances Holt;
Harriet, Almedia Hamilton; Louise,
Margaret Bay; Mr. Hastings, Eliza-
beth Donnely; Rowena Brewster,
Carolyn Garbe; Emily, Pauline Shad-
lio, and Margaret Wargo will under
study the lead. Margaret Wargo
and Wilhemena Warner are in
charge of costumes and properties.

This comedy will be offered by the
women who are candidates for ad-
mission into the Women’s Speakers
club. It is the custom of the organ-
ization to admit a woman after she
has exhibited her ability in public
speaking. This play will give an op-
portunity to the entering girls to
prove their ability.

ASSIGN PARTS
FOR CAST AND

CHORUS LEADS

Dramatis Personae T o
Include Forty-five

Women

Esther Cook. Beatrice Cowan, Mar-
jorie Creighton, Ruth DeWitt. Eleanor
Metzel and Ruth Atwell were selected
to give the main dramatic impersona-
tions in the First Annual Mirror, the
forth-coming dramatic production to
be held in Mandel hall, Friday and
Saturday nights of March 5 and 6.

Janet Good, Ruth Holmes, Lois
Russel, and Florence Schwab have
been chosen to lead the chorus num-
bers.

Swirling in the maelstrom of mod-
ern day collegiatism, forty-five Uni-
versity women will pose long enough
to see themselves reflected fin the
prism of blue Mondays, pink teas and
purple twilights. In Mirror, they will
tell us what the college girl really is .;
—or what she thinks she is.

There have been many musical
shows and reviews produced
by college women, according to the
production managers. Many of them
have attempted to imitate Broadway,
New York and Randolph Street. Chi-
cago. But the women of the Univer-
sity of Chicago’s First Annual Mir-
ror are going to interpret themselves
—reflect themselves in dance, in song,
in parody—in picture.

The numerous Apollo aspirants on
campus will find themselves before
their own eyes and at the mercy of a
chorus which rivals their professional
sisters but in true college fashion.
The nature of numerous chorus num-
bers introducing music written by
campus composers is kept secret until
a later date.

Orchestra will meet today at 4:30
in Mandel hall.

A DIALOGUE

YOUNG MAN—1 don't think your quiz yesterday was quite fair,
sir.

You’ll Find February

PROFESSOR—Why not, Mr

(prompted) Mr. Boggs.

Y. M.—Because it didn't test what a man knew about the subject.
One fellow could pass it with very little real knowledge; another fel-
low with real ideas might have missed half the questions.

PRESENTS A RARE OPPORTUNITY for
you to secure exceptionally fine hand-tailored
clothes at Rock-Bottom Prices.

PROF.—I'm afraid 1 don’t understand you. I tried to make the
test very easy. Don t you think that anybody who has read the text
could pass it? Take Question 1: "To what four causes does Wat-
son attribute the War of 1812?” Could any intelligent student, who
has read the text, miss that?

Y. M.—That’s just the trouble, it seems to me. What about the
man who hasn’t read the text?

PROF.—Well, I’m sorry for him. That’s about al! 1 can say. I
consider it a very easy test.

You’ll have hundreds of beautiful new woolens
to choose from—MEDIUM WEIGHTS FOR
ALL-YEAR WEAR, heavy weights for winter,
and New Spring Woolens for those who buy for
the future at Great Savings.

ty well, and do a great deal of reading about it, and even have ideas
of his own—without memorizing Watson’s four causes.

PROF.—All right, Mr. Boggs. 1 shall give you another chance;
1 shall give you a test even easier than this. But—-but 1 considered it
remarkably easy.

Today is February 24—leaving you ONLY
FOUR DAYS to take advantage of this opportun-
ity. HURRY!

Extra Trousers or Knickers

WE EXPAND

YOU are interested in other things besides class mixers and P. C.

requirements. Basketball games and quadrangular track meets
are not your only concern. Even the undergraduate council and its
intolerance of Maroon reporters—even news of this does not quench
your curiosity. If The Daily Maroon is to satisfy you. it must print
more than all these.	.......

You are interested, for example, in books or shows or concerts.
You would like to know what people think. You want to read some-
thing a little more imaginative than the front page of a newspaper
can be.

“Young man,” we might answer, ‘‘are there not magazines made
especially to fill such wants as yours? Have we not one magazine
in particular, published at our own University, which includes within
its field humor, art, and philosophy? You will find the office of this

Featured at our Michigan Avenue Store

magazine, The Phoenix, next door.
We, my dear Sir. are a newspaper.”

We might say this, accept your
thanks with a don’t-mention-it, and re-
turn to our typewriter. But we hesi-
tate. Just what is our job? Of course
we are a newspaper—which means
that we tell you a story as soon as the
story happens, without stopping to or-
ganize, philosophize, or see things ‘‘in
the light of eternity.” We tell you as
much news as we can; therefore we
have no time to tell it formally. Our
manner is chaotic. A magazine, on the
other hand, plays the philosopher. It
systematizes its material; it arranges
its articles, more or less, according to
their meaning. If we tried such a plan
tomorrow’s issue would come off th?
press just in time for spring vacation.

But couldn’t we present, in this
same chaotic, all-inclusive manner,
other things besides the news of Score
club elections and Intramural point-
winners? Isn’t there news of the day
among books and shows and concerts,
and even among ideas? Don’t things
happen rapidly in these fields, as else-
where? They do; and are therefore to
be recorded in two ways. Magazines

Illini wrestlers came up from Cham-

place in the Conference as a result

The feature of the meet was the
defeat of the Illini captain. Kinney, by
Captain Graham of the Maroons in
the 137-pound class. These men went
at it hard for 8 minutes and 7 seconds

Art Sheir of the Maroos lost a bout
to Spenco, the Illini star, after 4 min

the first bout on the card.

The lightest bout of the e.ening
went to Knitz of Chicago after he
had gone rt for 9 minutes and 34 sec-
onds with Pyle in the 147 pound class.

In the 160 pound class Dunloch of
Illinois threw Penstone of Chicago
in 4 minutes and 5 seconds.

Heavy Bouts Exciting

Krogh, a Maroon 177 pounder,
threw Strauve of Illinois after 2 min-
utes and 23 seconds of tough going.
The bout was far more even than the
time would indicate.

In the heavyweight bout Shirly of
Illinois gained a decision over the
Maroon Johnson after the pair had
wrestled for 7 minutes.

Massey’s Injury Cripples Maroons

Bob Massey, Maroon 158 pound
star, was out of the lineup because of
a badly bruised shoulder received in
the last meet. This injury crippled
the team severely and may explain the
defeat.

Few people were present at the
meet and all were seated. A fine spirit
of sportsmanship was d'splayed all
the way through.

Nobody fell through the ropes last
night, and on the whole the meet was
characterized by fair play on the
athletes’ part. But there was no lack
of enthusiasm, both wrestlers and
spectators going at it heartily.

The audience, despite its extreme
sparseness, showed plenty of spirit, for
the onlookers were always upon their
chairs, yelling and throwing hats.
Many persons think it extremely un-
fortunate that the wrestling meets are
so poorly attended.

Gymnasts Lose to Purdue In
First Setback of
the Year

Unless happenings more weird
than those that have beset the Big
Ten cage race thus far occur, it ap^
pears that Craig Ruby’s Illini have
the title practically cinched. By ad-
ministering a sound thrashing to the
Maroons who forgot that the Wash-
ington Prom was over, the Orange
and Blue now have a record of six vic-
tories and two defeats. Its nearest
rival has at least four defeats so
that things look rosy down in Cham-
paign.

As a result of the 24 to 16 defeat
for the Maroons, Chicago dropped to
eighth place. Sackett and Zimmer-
man had an off night and were un-
able to find the hoop in the immense
Illini armory’. Alyea played the best
game for the Maroons with two
pretty ringers and clever floorwork.
Haines played a stellar game for the
downstaters.

Close Games

Michigan’s defeat of Wisconsin
put the Badgers out of the running
and Indiana’s 21-20 defeat by Illi-
nois on Saturday ruined the Hoosier
hopes. Northwestern was unable to
break Iowa’s home floor winning
streak and was nosed out 12 to 11
in a game featured by the tight
guarding of both teams. Purdue
also bent Meanwell’s crew over the
busy week-end.

And out of the scramble the vet-
eran Illinois quintet reaped a har-
vest. It can now drop two of its
remaining four games and still tie
for the title. Indiana, Purdue, Michi-
gan, and Wisconsin still have an out-
side chance for the title.

The Maroons have but two more
games to play, the next game being
with Iowa, Saturday at Iowa City.
The result of this tilt will have no
bearing on the cage leadership, but
will give the Maroons a chance to
avenge their early season defeat at
the hands of the Hawks.

All in all, it appears as if the ath-
letically aspiring Maroons under
Messrs. Norgren, McGillivray, Eck
and Hoffer did not make the past
week-end one which might be trium-
phantly hailed as a howling success.
That is, if four defeats in as manv
chances for victory may be regarded
in a not altogether favorable light.

However, in conjunction with the
Wisconsin swiming meet, the water
polo team did manage to annex what
may be called a victory; and the
fencers came close at Lafayette
where they got an even break. But
—Wisconsin splashed the water more
vigorously than the paddling Ma-
roons; the basketeers returned Illi-
nois’ courtesy of some weeks ago;
the track team finished fourth in a
quadrangular meet, and even Coach
Dan Hoffer’s gymnasts, who were
thought to have forgotten how to
lose, turned graceful somersaults all
in vain at Purdue.

Even the Gymnast* Lose

Illinois showed Alyea and his
mates that when it comes to guard-
ing, the downstaters are not such a
bad lot themselves, the Maroons gar-
nering only four field goals.

At Patten gym the University of
Wisconsin jumped and ran to amass
a winning total of 55 2-3 points. The
Maroons were fourth with 18 5-6
counters, which they won largely
through Berg’s second and thirds in
the jumps, and placing in two relays.
Hobscheid showed what an arch cure
tan do for a man when he took
fourth in the shot.

The gymnasts made a clean sweep
of the tumbling event but Purdue
retaliated with a slam in the parallel
bar event. Score, 1,142 to 1,122.8.
The fencers activities were to win
11-0 in duels, lose in foils 5 to 4, and
tie sabers.

Gentlemen:

'Last evening I had the pleasure
of driving one hundred and sixty miles
to see Chicago defeat Purdue in the
home of the boiler-makers. Knowing
what it means to win a ball game away
from home, I just want to take '.is
opportunity to congratulae Coach
Norgren and his squad on their clean
cut victory. Chicago had five fighters
on the floor every minute and there
seemed to be ten other good men ; ail-
ing tor victory on the bench.

This victory reminded us of old time
battles of Hinkle, Crisler, Gorgas,
Birkhoff. and company. Last night
Captain Alyea turned in a fine game,
Hoerger and McDonough guarded
well, while Sackett and Zimmerman
got in some good licks. Chicago’s
brains predominated and their hand-
ling of the ball was perfection.

Believing the student body would
just like to know that Chicago’s team
this year is a fine aggregation and give
a good account of themselves on the
road. I am,

Sincerely,

H. O. PAGE,
Director of Athletics

Charleston Exhibition And Boxing Match Added To Long
List Of Special Events; Varsity
Trackmen Perform

By BUI Weddell

Entries have already begun to pour
into the Intramural office for the Sec-
ond Annual Athletic Carnival which
will take place on Thursday evening,
March 5th, in Bartlett gymnasium. In
order to reach every individual or the
campus, blanks were sent to every
fraternity and men’s organization and
arrangements have been made to re-
ceive un-organized men’s entries at
any time at the Intramural office on
the third floor of Bartlett gymnasium.

It is the well known aim of the de-
partment to reach everyone with its
activities and in the big Carnival it is
hoped that every man on campus who
can shake a muscle will be on hand for
the competition which will be so va-
ried that everyone, no matter how bi-
zarre his inclination, will find an out-
let for his particular athletic or aesthe-
tic bent.

Everyone Eligible

To avoid mistakes or eligibility, the
Intramural department has issued ihe
statement that absolueiy everyone ex-
cept track men will be eligible for the
various events in the "Carnival. This
means that only Varsity track men
and frosh “green shirt men’’ will be
ruled out of the Intramural contests
and that men on other varsity teams
will be eligible to take part. Several

special events for Varsity and “green
shirt’’ men are on the evening’s card
to add spice to the affair and to keep
them in shape for the Conference meet
the following week-end.

Arnold Johnson, who is General
Manager of the Carnival, announced
today that two new members had been
added to the roster of events. A
Charleston exhibition and a boxing
match are the latest stunts to be an-
nexed to the evening’s card, which
now includes such feature events as
the finals in the Intramural basketball,
wrestling, fencing and track and field
events, fraternity singing, boxing and
Charleston exhibitions, a parade and
band concert, and novelty stunts
which will be announced later by John
Howe who is in charge of that end of
the ball.

Prelims On Tuesday

"The plans are progressing smooth-
ly and efficiently,’’ said Doctor Mo-
lander, Intramural advisor, “We have
arranged to have two different shifts
of officials, one on the upper track and
one on the main floor, to speed up
the numbers and to insure the prompt
execution of the numerous events. The
preliminaries in a/J the events will be
held on Tuesday afternoon in Bart-
l£d 8ym and on Thursday evening
only the finals in each event will be
held.

The life story of 100 average men as revealed by
statisticians who have studied the economic and social
conditions of society discloses the following interesting
facts. On the basis of 100 men 25 years old starting
out in life without resources except their earning power
it is found that at the age of 65 years—

36 are dead

54 are dependent on others

6 are self supporting

4 are well off
