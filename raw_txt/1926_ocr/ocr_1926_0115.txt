PARTIES SHOULD
BE MODERNIZED

SAYS MERRIAM

Tells Radio Audience Defects
In Present Political

System

Reconstruction of the political party
on modern lines, and a hospitable at-
titude toward improvements in the
forms of democratic government were
advocated by Prof. Charles E. Mer-
riam, head of the department of poli-
tical science at the University, in a
radio talk last night from Mitchell
Tower.

"The slacker vote is one of the
great menaces to democratic govern-
ment,” the speaker said. "On the
heels of the civic slackers comes the
dictator.”

European countries are experiment-
ing with preferential and compulsory
balloting, and Germany and Belgium
have succeeded in bringing out as high
as 90 per cent of the eligible voters.
This tendency to make innovations is
one of the chief differences between
the American and continental systems
of representative government, accord-
ing to Prof. Merriam.

Tells of Appointments

In analyzing other peculiarities of
party government in the United States
the lecturer mentioned the great num-
ber of elective offices—estimated at
750,000-—and the even greater number
of appointive jobs. The spoils sys-
tem, founded on these conditions, is
almost without parallel in foreign
countries.

"In the European countries, the
merit system in public administration
is almost universally adopted. Poli-
llV,^,,e, musi draw the fine at UMW
the people’s administrative service as
pawns in the game of politics.’ as-
serted Prof. Merriam.

Pointe to Party Systems

A fourth striking peculiarity of
American politics is the two party
system. Some European nations
have as many as twenty parties, based
on sharp religious, racial and economic
distinctions. These parties elect their
candidates and form coalition gov-
ernments after election.

In behalf of the student body the
Undergraduate council sent Dean
Ernest Hatch Wilkins a bouquet
of roses yesterday to his suite at

A card accompanying the flow-
ers read: “The undergraduate stu-
dents of the University send tieir
best wishes and hope for your
early recovery. (Signed) The Un-
dergraduate council."

“Dean Wilkins is showing a
marked improvement,” stated Dr.
Herman L. Kretschmer today
“His physical condition is better
than we expected it to be in so
short a time, and his optomistic at-
titude has helped him wonderfully.

“After spending an easy night
his pulse has returned to normal
and his temperature is going down.
He was more cheerful today than
we have seen him yet,” concluded
the physician under whose treat-
ment Dean Wilkins has been rest-
ing.

Drs. James B. Herrick and Peter
Bassoe held consultation with Dr.
Kretschmer today and substan-
tiated the reports of the attending

tion.

Oliphant Scorns
Idea Shakespeare .
Was Super-man

Conceding Shakespeare to be the
greatest dramatist of all time, Er-
n ?st H. C. Oliphant of Australia,
speaking in Harper assembly room
yesterday afternoon, scorned the idea
that the Elizabethan dramatist was
a । intellectual superman.

Shakespeare did not have a re-
markable knowledge of law, medi-
cine and science in general, as often
attributed to him the speaker said,
voicing the opinion that he, with his
n eagre knowledge of those subjects,
knows more of them than did Shakes-
peare. Special credit is given to the
Elizabethan dramatist for his legal
knowledge, Oliphant said, but “there
is more knowledge of law evidenced
b. ore page of Ben Johnson’s work I
than in all of Shakespeare.”

Just Got By

"Shakspeare had a superficial
knowledge and made a good show-
ing—just enough to get by,” the
speaker asserted. i

Shakespeare’s lack of originality
was also the target of the speaker,
v ho asserted that the great dramatist
had borrowed plots, and plays of
others, and their phrases and
thoughts. He improved them, it is
true, Oliphant told his hearers, but
asserted that it is less difficult to be
an improver than an originator.

Shakespeare Divine Thief

“All poets have been the most col-
ossal and divine thieves,” the speak-
er asserted.

Shakespeare was original in the'
delineation of character,—according
t<> Oliphant. He drew a comparison
between Shakespeare and Johnson
:”d Marlowe, declaring that had
Shakespeare, born the same yearns
Marlowe, died at the same age, the
latter would stand out now as the
greater.

Interest Is Dying

“They say of Shakespeare that he
wrote for all time. But did he?”
Oliphant asked, pointing to the lack
of enthusiasm for Shakespeare today
as a possible negative answer, and
attributing the attitude not only to
acting, and the decline of blank
verse, but to faults which have be-
come apparent in the dramas.

The speaker closed by repeating
that he regarded Shakespeare as the
greatest dramatist of all time, but
that he certainly was not a super-
man, demi-god or intellectual giant.

HARVARD FACULTY
GRANTS UNLIMITED

CUTS TO SENIORS

The privilege of unlimited cuts
except on the days immediately pre-
ceding and following holiday seasons
has been extended to all seniors in
good standing at Harvard university.
The new ruling will take effect after
the mid-term examinations, accord-
ing to the “Harvard Crimson.”

“The decision of the faculty to
leave attendance of classes by se-
niors to their own discretion is sig-
nificant of the increasing confidence
and reliance to be placed in the stu-
dents,” said the daily.

The success of the Dean’s List
privilege of extending the vacation
period of students with high standing
has been acknowledged by a gradual
increase in the size of the groty? so
benefited. The present action, while
experimental, has been frankly an-
nounced as likely, if not abused, to
be a step toward the extention of
the privilege to members of other
classes. The reason announced for
the decision is to make Harvard a
school for only those who really de-
sire an education.

The European system of clasr at-
tendance was first introduced into
Harvard two years ago when the tak-
ing of attendance in graduate
courses was abolished; at that time
even an undergraduate not on the
Dean’s list, if sufficiently advanced
in some subject to take a graduate
course, could enjoy the privilege of
optional attendance.

YOU CAN PAY YOUR
TUITION AND LEARN

TO FOX TROT NOW

A tuition receipt is all that a
student at the University needs
to learn how to dance. The fox
trot, the waltz, the one step—ev-
erything except the Charleston.

Classes that are to be open to
every one hold a Winter quar-
ter tuition receipt will begin next
Monday night under the direction
of Miss Gertrude Goyle. They will
be held every Monday night at the
quarter of 7 in the gymnasium of
Ida Noyes.

Following the short period of
instruction there will be an hour
of social dancing to which all un-
dergraduates are cordially invited.
No more dancing schools; no more
wall flowers—they’re all going to
learn at Ida Noyes.

Since the dancing is open to
all students and sundry and there
is no charge for admission, the
Monday evening affairs should
prove a rendezvous for those gen-
tlemen who have gone home over
the week end, or have just bought
tickets to the Washington prom

GRANQUIST NEW

As Hospitaller

scripts be shown to him in their un-
completed form at this time.

of the Board of Superiors of Black-
friars, is not in residence this quar-
ter but it is expected that he will

retary, the Board desires to know

ILUNI TO MEET
STRONG SQUADS:

Urbana, 111., Jan. 14—All that the
University of Illinois basketball team
has to do now is to meet Ohio at Co-
lumbus Saturday and then hustle up
to Ann Arbor to tackle Michigan on
Monday. This itinerary is sufficient
to account for the activity on the local
floor this week.

Coach Ruby’s squad will consist of
Capt. “Ted" Haines, Mike Reynolds,
“C huck” Kassel. Ken Deimling,
guards; Russ Daugherty, Johnny
Mauer, Jack Lipe, Holly Martin and
Bud Stewart, forwards. The Illini
will arrive in Columbus Saturday
morning and entrain for Detroit Sat-
urday night, spending Sunday there
and traveling to Ann Arbor Monday
morning.

There seems to be much probability
that Diemling will break into the
starting "lineup. The lanky sophomore
made his debut as a regular against
Minnesota in place of Capt. Haines
and gave a good account of himself as
soon as he recovered from his natural
nervousness. Ruby uses Deimling to
jump center and then pulls him back
to guard. Deimling is a six-footer
who is fast, dribbles well, is a good
shot and is aided by the fact that he
is left-handed.

Providing that Deimling starts in-
stead of Haines, the latter, of course,
will figure in the games later on. The
captain is too good a player to be with-
held.

THE SECRET fraternities are hav-
ing a great time these days, paddling
their neophytes into a brotherly real-
ization of the Bond. The paddling we
are prone to accept as a necessary
impulse on the part of some individ-
uals to pick on someone who cannot
fight back, but the effrontery of those
who refer to it all as representative of
the Secret Fraternity! Years ago,
when fraternities were not frats, and
the members wore their pins only to
meetings, the membership roster of
each organization was kept from an
impertinent campus, oaths of frater-
nity secrecy were held inviolate. Se-
crets were secrets, not confidences.
But in these days, when fraternity
rituals are revealed at parties to the
rate of one ideal per pint of gin, when
the Bartlett shower rooms and blithely
the aBrtlett shower rooms and blithely
swap grips, when a popular girl can
explain the seal on every pin she pos-
sesses, we find it difficult to follow the
popular conception. Probably the
biggest mystery surrounding secret I
fraternities is our naive belief in their [
[secrecy!

Professor D. G. Stewart of

Johns Hopkins University

Has psychologically explained

All womanhood’s diversity.

He claims that woman cannot judge

The time when they are dressing,
And so they are not punctual—

A fact that’s most distressing.

And so my friends, there’s naught to
do.

We men must simply wait

While woman is misjudging time

Or else we get the gate!

WE owe thanks to GeoG for his
administration of the dirty work yes-
terday when we were incapacitated,
but we cannot help doubting the sin-
cerity of his references to our Grecian
nose and other physiognomical char-
acteristics.

What Of It

From the Daily Maroon—“Coach
MacGillivary maintains that it is ab-
solutely necessary to use the foul
whistle often in order to insure clean
sportsmanship in water polo.” Prob-
ably they read excerpts from it until
the combatants are so convulsed that
they haven’t the energy to pursue un-
fair tactics.

SAY!

Do you think that a metaphysician
With a long psychological plan,

Could induce microscopical effort
In an anthrropological man?

Could a flat phrenological failure
With a physiological chill,

Love a sociological expert
With a teleological thrill?

Do you think ethnological records
Astronomical worlds, will embue

With correct biographical statements
As to why my girl’s eyes are so
blue??

BASKET GAMES

Alpha Delta Phi defeated Sigma

No Dope Upsets; Scores All
Close and Tilts Are
Fast

No runaway games, no dope up-
sets, and several forfeitures were in-
cluded in the Intramural Basketball
play last evening. In spite of the
close scores, there were few exciting
contests. Sideline attendance was
also smaller than at the two previous
assemblies. Interest is expected to
pick up in the near future as prob-
able league winners are being dis-
covered in the early play.

Alpha Deltas Win

Alpha Delta Phi, led by the clever
shooting of Smoil, left guard, nosed
out the Sigma Chi quintet by a 12
to 10 count. Both teams were out to
win their first game with the result-
ing hard play that made the affair
interesting and anybody’s victory to
the last toss-up. Duggan and Scott
were the Sigma Chi luminaries.

Deke* Take Forfeit

The other Gamma “A’’ league con-
test which was scheduled for Delta
Kappa Epsilon vs. Phi Delta Theta
was forfeited to the Dekes. This
gives D. K. E. a good start toward
the championship of her league with
victories over the Kappa Nus, Alpha
Delta, and Phi Delta.

Phi Paia Craah Through

Phi Kappa Psi came back in the
second half to put over a 15 to 11
victory on the dangerous S. A. E.
team. Stellar work by Silverwood,
Smith, and Klein kept the S. A. E.’s
in the lead until late in the game,
when baskets by “Bub” Henderson
and “Woo” Laverty sent the Phi
Psis ahead. Laverty was high point
man with four buckets, and Harmon
exhibited some valuable guarding for
the winners.

Chi P*i Unbeaten

Chi Psi was handed a forfeit by
the Acacia team. The Chi Psis were
favorites to win by virtue of the
form displayed in their first game
of the season when they defeated
Lambda Chi Alpha. This leaves Phi

Kappa Sigma and Chi Psi the
undefeated teams in the Beta
leagues.

The more

the skill shown the greater will be
the joy of the coaches, for it will mean

The main purpose of the meet is to

glory unto themselves, but the under-
lying purpose is to give the coaches
a chance to unearth those who are not
confident enough to step forward
themselves.

Opportunities will be given in full
measure to all, for all of the usual
indoor events are to be run off. Re-

WHATp/IT?

^«ORgE MORgENSTEiyi

1 was, you may well belive, greatly
surprised the other day when, aim-
lessly admiring .he Gothic beauties of
Cobb Hall before my 11 o’clock class,
I was approached by a solemn deputa-
tion of representative men who in-
formed me, through their august
spokesman, that I had been selected

to be the so-called

“independent”

standard-bearer in the forthcoming
freshman election for class president.
It took me. I say, completely un-
awares, but I rallied bravely, and after
a few minutes I was again in com-
plete control of my faculties.

“I am,” I replied to the deputation,
"by nature disinclined to befoul my
hands in the common filth of the cam-
pus political ring, but,” and here I
looked about the circle of noble vis-
ages whose eager look was bent on
me, “in such a case”—here my voice
rose with a thrilling ring—“I say, in
such a case as this. I will abandon
personal prejudice, I will lose all
thoughts of self, and, gentlemen, I
will represent in this coming election
them great principles for which the
independent party has ever stood! I
say I will, gentlemen, and indeed I

will be as good as my word.”
thought I heard a faint ripple of
plause run around the circle of
deputation.

the

Such were the dramatic circum-
stances under which I became em-
broiled in the national sport of playing
politics. After having surrendered
myself into the hands of the deputa-
tion in the above described manner, I
immediately set about the business of
finding out what was what in this
matter of my candidacy. I learned
from the august person who headed
the deputation that there were five
fraternity men and a club woman in
the race, and this situation had occa-

Ticket Holders Must
Come to Games Early

According to A. A. Stagg, students
hloding season books will have to pre-
sent their tickets for admission to
basketball games in Bartlett gym-
nasium before 7:45 p. m. This ac-
tion is necessary becauseof the large
number of friends of the university
who wish to see the basketball games.

Since the capacity of Bartlett gym-
nasium is limited by the fire or-
dinance, students who want to be
sure of admission, should be at the

Over 400 Boys Will Run
In Seventh Annual
Field Meet

With twenty four schot|s entered
and over four hundred boys sched-
uled to compete, the seventh annual
Cook County Track and Field meet
which will be held in Bartlett gym
beginning next Saturday promises to
break all previous records for this af-
fair. This is the greatest number of
men that has ever been entered.
Practically all of the teams in the
country have been working out for
this event for several months and it

Saturday’s results should
change the existing situation in
the Big Ten considerably. One of
the leaders is bound to fall when
Illinois plays Ohio state. The
Staters are counted on to win
quite easily. Northwestern should
give Purdue a battle, and the In-
diana-Iowa game also gives prom-
ise of being one of the nip and
tuck kind.

this week, Dan Hoffer’s crack gym-
nasts will entertain the campus sport
fans whod remain at home. The Mil-
waukee Y. M. C. A. meets Hoffer’s
powerful squad tomorrow night at 8
o’clock. The turners from the city
that Schlitz made famous are rated as
one of the most powerful teams in the
state and a close contest is expected.

On the horizontal bars Capt. Jerry
Quinn, Flexner, and Davidson will be
the Maroon reliables. The same trio
will go through contortions on the
parallel bars. Nelson, Quinn and Con-
nor will attempt to defy the laws of
gravity on the horse, and with David-
son will thrill the spectators with
somersaults of all kifids. Flexner,
Davidson, and Connor will go swing-
ing through space on the rings. Capt.
Quinn will also give an exhibition of
Indian club swinging, in which he
was conference champion last year.

Powers.

• Although Ohio
have each lost a

in Hotchkiss and

State and Purdue
game to the other

they are both decidedly still in the
race. Purdue with Spradling and
Cramer, and Ohio State with Cun-
ningham, both have powerful offenses
around which their hopes of a cham-
pionship are centered. Their system
of attack does away with any defen-
sive measures and they rely upon their
ability to out-score their opponents
to win.

Michigan with Molenda, football
fullback, backed by a team of veterans
is without a doubt on par with the
other quintets mentioned. Indiana,
an early season favorite, is declining
and unless they show improvement
they will make way for the others.

Honors From Seniors

third straight Big Ten victory Satur-
day at Madison, and Chicago, by the
same portents, in for its second con-
secutive defeat. The Badgers are al-
ways the most powerful team in the
Conference by the end of the season,
when the men have had time to
completely polish off Meanwell’s sys-
tem to such a point that they are
practically unbeatable, but this is
the first winter in a long time that
they have hit top form right at the
start.

Badger Squad Strong

Wisconsin lost but one of its prac-
tise games, and after that start
Meanwell’s five kept right on going,
taking Minnesota by a safe margin
and beating the crack Indiana team
by a basket in a wild gme. Both
these games were on the floor at
Madison, and if the Cardinals can
put Chicago under they will be off
to a start that may come in very use-
ful when the team hits the midsea-
son road trips.

Chicago looked to have something
of a defense against Iowa last Sat-
urday, but it looked good more be-
cause the Hawkeyes were using but
three men in their attack inside the
scoring zone than because the Ma-
roons had a fairly air-tight guarding
game. The Maroons will need all
they’ve got to keep the Wisconsin
dribble and trailer game from cutting
in for such a number of close pops
as will prove ruinous.

Maroon* Rather Slow

Pat Page, who preceded Norgren
as Maroon coach, used to work a
system against the Cardinals that oc-
casionally pulled out with a victory.
He put all the fastest men he had on
the floor and kept things going so
fast for the first ten minutes of each
half that the Badgers never had a
chance of slowing things down to
suit their deliberate, feinting for
position game. Norgren, however,
can’t do that, for his material is
only ordinarily fast.

There are two sophomore forwards
in Meanwell’s lineup, but Brooks at
center and both guards are juniors
with a year’s experience. Behr, a
frail looking sophomore who is still
remembered for his work for Rock-

New men, sophomore and juniors,

FOR I-M WRESTUNG

With the last of the entries for the
Intra-mural w resting tournament in
yesterday, the preliminaries were an-
nounced for 3:30 in Bartlett gymnas-
ium Thursday afternoon. The finals
of each class of weights will be staged
a week from today.

Unlike the other sports being con-
ducted by the Intramural" department
no participation points will be granted
to the entering fraternity representa-

to the group having the best all-around
aggregate score.

The matches will smack of the more
scientific as nearly all of last year’s
participants are again entered in the
competition. The entry of a number
of varsity football men will add inter-

A Nation Built by Rail

The three preceding discussions in this series have dealt
briefly with trasportation as a whole, the place of the railroads
in transportation and the railroads of the world. The next
subject in order is the railroads of the United States. These
railroads are of personal interest to each one of us, not only by
reason of the essential service they render us but also by
reason of the control that we all exercise over them through
our patronage and through our governmental regulation of
them.

Railroads in the United States arc not yet one hundred years
old, for their introduction into this country followed by a few
years their inception in England, the centennial of which was
celebrated in 1925; yet it is not too much to say that the rail-
roads have meant more to the United States than they have
meant to any other nation in the world. The greater part of
our existence and growth as an indeiendent natiion has heen
coincident with and has been made possible by the railway era.
The history of the development of our vast interior land areas
has been almost entirely a railway story.

Today, with only al>out one-eighteenth of the world's land
area, we possess in this country approximately one-third of the
total railway mileage of the world, and our railroads lead
those of all other nations in the high quality and low cost of
their service. Our 250,000 miles of railway line and their
150,000 miles of additional track could circle our Ixirders ap-
proximately forty-five times or across and recross the country
at its widest point more than 130 times if they were so laid
out. We have one mile of railway line for every 440 members
of our population and for every twelve square miles of our
land area, as compared with one mile for every 2,400 persons
and for every eighty square miles of land area the world over.

Most of our railway statistics relate to our Class 1 railroads,
which are those roads having annual operating revenues in ex-
cess of $1,000,000 and which constitute approximately nine-
tenths of the railway mileage of the country. The present in-
vestment of more than $24,000,000,000 in these railroads is ap-
proximately one-half that in our factories and one-fourth that
in our farms. The annual task of these railroads in recent
years has been to provide for each member of our population,
on the average, a freight movement of slightly more than ten
tons approximately 360 miles and a passenger trip of approxi-
mately 325 miles. This high level of transportation per capita
is one indication, as it is one result, of the exceptionally high
standard of living which our people enjoy. We are better
served and of tetter served by railway transportation than the
people of any other country in the world.

Our Class I railroads have approximately 65,000 locomotives,
55,000 passenger train cars and 2,(1)0,000 freight train cars.
They employ approximately 1,800,000 persons, or nearly one
out of every twenty wage-earners in the country. Their owners
number nearly one million and their bondholders almost the
same. They load approximately one million cars a week and
pay approximately a million dollars a day in taxes.

Truly the efficiency of this gigantic business means a great
deal to every citizen. Intelligent study of our railway problems
is a duty in which our citizens fortunately seem to be taking a
greater interest all the time.

Constructive criticism and suggestions are invited.
