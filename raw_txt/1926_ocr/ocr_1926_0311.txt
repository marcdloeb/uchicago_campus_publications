Henry Sackett, manager of the
tournament has been disappointed in
the past in the attitude of the stu-
dent body toward the visitors that
we have entertained at this event.

The heads of the tournament are
making every effort to get the boys
interested in the student body and
in the University. “The participants
come here to take part in the great-
est interscholastic athletic event of
the year and to see one of the great-
est Universities,” said Sackett. “The
student body should not disappoint
these men who come from every
state in the country.

meeting all those who have, at any
time, contributed to the column, as
well as those who are interested, pro-

work with them, are invited.

Members of the new organization

whether or not they wish to become a

According to Leo Stone (Terrible
Turk) who. at the present time edits
the column, the next editor of The
Whistle will be selected yearly from
the membership of the club. In this |
way he hopes not only to establish i
legitimate wax of picking an editor,
but also hopes to organize a thor-
oughly precedented column.

Beauty or Brains? If you could
have only one of the two, which
would you prefer? In a recent ques-
tionnaire circulated about campus
only 100 out of 300 of the so called
modern college flappers preferred
beauty.

Brains were preferred by the great
majority of the women, the reasons
for their selection were definite and
sufficient to uphold their choice.
Several women stated that brains or
intellect made one interesting, that
interesting people held attention and
their listeners forgot their looks and
believed the brainy one attractive.

Furth*1 explanations for choosing
brains consisted of such replies as
“One must think of the future
generation, where would they be with
only beauty?” “Beauty without
brains is hopeless, so give me brains”
exclaimed another. Those a little
more frivolous made such statements
as, “Brains, because I am through
with men,” and ’Intellectual women

Even if the majority voted for
brains, still many women warmly
supported the opposite side, beauty.
“Beauty makes more of a hit with
the men,” “Beauty is coupled with
dumbness and ignorance is bliss.”

‘Beauty makes one popular.” If
all persons preferred brains it would

THE NEWSPAPERS AND CAMPUS INSPIRATION

By Leo Stone

<^/^RIBBING during the examinations at the University of Chicago
^'has caused the authorities to adopt a new set of rules.” This
is the content of a statement made in a newspaper downtown in re-
gard to our final examination regulations as they had been re-stated
by the Honour commission in accordance with the regular tradition
of many years. Untrue, of course, but how does the gullible and
usually uninformed public know that? It is this and other forms
of journalistic misinterpretation which do a great deal of the dam-
age to the reputation of a University—undeserved damage.

Anyone who is familiar with the rules of the University of Chi-
cago naturally knows that our final examination methods are by no
means a reflection on the honesty of the students. They are no
more stringent than the regulations which are imposed by any of the
other universities. However, the newspaper in reporting the matter
connected it up with an editorial in the student newspaper of North-
western in which, to criticize a faculty action against an athlete who
had eloped with a co-ed, the matter of cheating was brought up as a
justified field for official interference. The Northwestern editorial
writer did not particularly admit dishonesty in the school; he merely
pointed out that the authorities should pay more attention to that
and similar campus problems than to the matrimonial adventures of
their students. But with the Northwestern article employed as an
admission of collegiate guilt, and the Chicago regulations as a result
of it, the reporter made out quite a convincing case. The actual
facts were given, but with a dangerous subtlety.

1\/F^APPROPRIATION of facts is not our only grudge against the
A Chicago papers. Another of thier habits is to report a practical
joke or any sort of silly undertaking on campus as a serious, in-
tentioned event. After the Washington Prom, a few weeks ago, a
newspaper published a picture of a few of the student celebrities who
had attended. A football player, who had the back luck to be nom-
inated in the Maroon Man Hunt, was gravely identified on the photo-
graph as “the handsomest man at the U. of C.”

Another annoying policy of the downtown gazettes is the out-
right manufacture of events purported to have happened on the Uni-
versity campus. A few years ago, it might be remembered, two
morning papers published an account of a “Hard Egg club which
had been formed at the University by students who were tired of
wearing conventional styles and intended to go to classes in their old-
est clothes. Everyone who was namd as a member of the club frankly
admitted later that he had consented to the use of hsi name only
because the reporter promised to publish his picture. The entire
matter was given to the public as an actual happening at the Univer-
sity. No wonder they believe in the Plastic Age!

WHEN the Senior mustache race, a well known tradition, was
being held last spring one of the largest of the downtown pa-
pers came out with a story that the men at the University had decided
to stop shaving. A photographer was sent. He had no difficulty in
persuading a good number of men to paint false mustaches on their
faces with mascara sticks before they posed for the picture. That
was one picture which was never printed. Lack of space, probably.

It is unfortunate that the University must suffer such treatment.
It is still more unfortunate that students of the University will aid the
reporters in concocting the stories which serve to make the public
think us even greater asses than we really are.

When old grads
drop in—and around the
fire experiences of then
are fondly retold

—have a Camel!

^

WHEN famed men re-
turn. And by dancing
firelight they relate their
stories of old — have a
Camel!

For Camel helps all
men who rise proudly to
rise higher and more
jauntily. Camels never
harm or tire your taste,
no matter how plentifully
you smoke them. You’ll
never find more friendly
flavor than you get in
Camels.

So this night when
those from long ago re-
turn to think of the
roads that join. As you
see in their past your
future Anfold, then zest-
fully taste the smoke
that’s prized by the
world’s experienced.

Our highest wish, if you
do not yet know Camel
quality, is that you try
them. We invite you to
compare Camels with
any cigarette made at
any price.

Into the making of this one cigarette goes all of the ability
of the world’s largest organization of expert tobacco men.
Nothing is too good for Camels. The choicest Turkish and
Domestic tobaccos. The most skilful blending. The most
scientific package. No other cigarette made is like Camels.
No better cigarette can be made. Camels are the over-
whelming choice of experienced smokers.

Operating more titan three hundred
stores, throughout the East and middle
West, the Kresge chain constitutes a great
national merchandising institution.

The remarkable success of the S. S.
Kresge Company will be surpassed by still
greater growth. New stores are frequently
being added. These require experienced
managers- competentmen,Kresgetrained.
There are now a limited number of
openings in the Kresge organization for
young men —college men—to learn every
phaze of this great national merchandise
ing business, from the ground up. The
men who start now will be in line for
future managerships with excellent oppor-
tunities to make money for themselves.
This is an opportunity well worth con-
sidering. Write to our Personnel
Department and we shall arrange for you
to meet a graduate of your own college
who has already found success in the
Kresge organization.

Tomorrow night the sixteenth
nual Conference championship

an-
in-

door track meet will get under way
at Patten Gym, and it appears that
the Maroons have but a slim chance
of landing up among the leaders.
Iowa, Illinois, Michigan and Wiscon-
sin with well balanced squads are
conceded the best chance to cop the
indoor classic.

Cusack, Burg To Star

The Maroons have two almost sure
point getters and possibly first place"
winners in Capt. Jimmy Cusack and
Anton Burg, who won the high jump
at the Illinois relays with a leap of
6 feet 2 and one-half inches. Cusack
is almost certain to place in the mile
as he copped the outdoor last year
and has made some fast time in dual

ites who have a chance to place.

The Badgers will place their hopes
in McGinnis for the high jump, Mc-
Andrews in the dashes, Kennedy in
the quarter, and Chapman the sensa-
tional sophomore miler. Ohio State
has the Olympic strr Guthrie for the
hurdles, Irwin in the dashes, and
Arnold and Kennedy in the longer
races. Iowa has a powerful, versatile
outfit in Capt. Dauber who is doped
to win the shotput, Cuhel, the quar-
'ter mile whizz, Roberts also a quarter
miler, Hunn, Beatty and Bergstrom
in the distance runs.

Wolverine* Strong

Michigan as usual boasts an excep-
tionally strong squad with Hester, a
sophomore who won the dash at the
Illini relays, Hernstein in the 440,
Feinsinger likewise a crack quarter
miler, and Freyberg Reinke in the
half mile, Munz in the shot- Illinois'
well rounded^ squad will include Wer-
ner, Gil’s hurdle find, Barnes and
White in the pole vault, Lyons in the
shot, Schoch in the quarter mile, and
White in the mile.

Baseball Team Practically Intact;

Start Outdoor Practice in April

With the conference baskettoll season
over and spring fast approaching Coach
Nels Norgren is putting the prospective
candidates for the baseball squad through
their paces in Bartlett Gym preparatory
for the outdoor practice which will start
sometime soon after the beginning of the
spring quarter. With the team practic-
ally intact from last season when the
Maroons won second place in the con-
ference and only missed a championship
by virtue of one base hit a very success-
ful season is anticipated. The team made
its regular trip to Japan last fall and as
a result all the men should be in fairly
good shape. Only four men, Bill Weiss,
Red Cunningham and the Howells will
be missing from the lineup this season
as a result of graduation.

Hurler* Strong

Norgren is especially well fixed, for
hnrlers having Gubbins and Marks, two
of the best pitchers in the conference
available. Gubbins is working out daily
and is in pretty fair shape while Marks
has been out for basketball all season
and should be ail ready to step into the
spangles. In addition there is George
Lott who was a star slabman with the

the nobbiest of all the sweaters
Cowhey’s drug store and men’s ap-
parel emporium can offer, accord-
ing to announcement emanating
from Mr. Cowhey himself.

He announced at the time of the
recent Chicago-Minnesota basket-
ball game that he would give the
best sweater the store had to of-
fer to the player who turned in
the best game for the Maroons
against the Gophers.

Alyea, winding up his college
basketball career, was adjudged
to have done this on a popular
vote made among Midway sports
observers. Babe is out in Kansas
City right now, learning the latest
mode in spring sweaters.

As a result of a protested game
the Phi Sigma Delta Bowling aggre-
gation will meet the Alpha Sigma Phi
team for the right to play in the
semi-finals of the University Bowling
championship. The Phi Sigs protest-
ed the previous encounter, which was
won by the Alpha Sigs on the
grounds that McConnel was at the
time a member of the varsity cage
squad and therefore ineligible for
intramural competition.

Allow Protest

The Intra-mural department allow-
ed the protest and at the same time
ordered the game to be enrolled.
The winner of this match will bowl
the Delta Chi five and this survivor
will meet the Macs for the cham-
pionship.

At 4:15 this afternoon there will
be a continuation of the first round
of the handball tourney which will
take place in the open courts under
the west stand of the stadium. The
following should appear for matches.
Edelstein, Phi Sig vs. Myer, Ro-
mans. Newman, Tau Sig vs. Witkew-
sky, unattached. Baker, Phi Kap vs.
Greiman, Romans, Gruskin, Tau

Frosh last year hut who is now on the
ineligible list. If he boosts his grades
this quarter his presence will bolster the
already strong mound staff a great deal.

last seasons yearlings and is out to win
his spurs.

do many a major I eager proud. He is
also a great handler of moundmen.

Brignail and Hoargar Back

There are two returning infielders in
the persons of Chuck Hoerger and
Claude Brignail. Both are flashy field-
ers and are wicked men with the stick.
Price a substitute of the 1925 squad will
make a strong bid for the first base posi-
tion left vacant by the graduation of
Captain Cunningham. He has a nice
build for a first sacker and should be
able to make the grade. Tex Gorden,
who was an excellent infielder with the
Freshman nine, is a good prospect for
shortstop.

The outfield will be the hardest hit by
the diploma route as only one regular



Over-Abundance Of Green
Material Makes Spring
Grind Important

The buds of football hopes, along
with the other things that sprout in
the spring and blossom in the fall,
are beginning to hopefully emerge.
In other words, the call for spring
football session has gone forth. The
prospects for next fall’s team appear
rather barren right now, for the grad-
uations have cut great holes in the
ranks of the eligibles. But even
though the Coaches Stagg, both Se-
nior and Junior bemoan the fact
that the team will undoubtedly be
“green,” the hopes of new finds and
the development of last year’s scrubs
brings back their usual enthusiasm.

Urge All To Come Out

Practise is scheduled to start as
soon as the new quarter opens and it
will continue until the Old Man feels
that he has a strong nucleus and a
solid foundation for the new team.

Uniforms are to be issued on the
afterntfon of March 29th at 3:45 to
any one who thinks that he has the
moral courage necessary to make a
football player. Those who are ignor-
ant of the lore of the game are espe-
cially invited to come out by Mr.
Stagg who says that the fundamen-
tal purpose of the season is to de-
velop men who have not had the op-
portunity to learn the art of of the
game.

But he also states that those who
are not in deadly earnest had better
try Their skill in other fields, for the
training is to be thorough and com-
plete.

Numeral Men Will Be Out

The first four or five weeks will be
devoted to developing the men and
when they have reached a certain
point of efficiency two squads under
the leadership of Lonnie Stsgg and

outgardener, Macklind, is due to re-
turn. Macklind is a great little ground
coverer and is also a heavy sticker and
should go great this spring. Wallie
Marks, who cavorts in the outfield when
other pitchers are on the mound will un-
doubtedly do a great deal of work in the
fly chasing department this spring as he
is a fast man in getting under flys and
is also a very capable hitter.

Basetoll is fast regaining its popular-
ity in intercollegiate circles as was shown
by the record crowds which turned out
for the big Ten games last season. Foot-
ball forced the great American game to
take a back seat inside the amateur
ranks during the war, hut you can't keep
a good game down. The sudden growth
in interest, which characterized every
game that the Maroons played last

Large Entry List
Breaks Record at
Purdue Gym Meet

LAFAYETTE, Ind., March 10—Two
hundred and eight athletes, a record
number, have been entered in the annual
Western Conference Wrestling, Gym-
nastics and Fencing meeting at Purdue
university next Friday and Saturday.
The individual championship in the seven
weights of wrestling have attracted the
largest number of entrants, 112. Gym-
nastics ranks next with 64 men and 34
are entered in the fencing meeting.

Every Big Ten school will be repre-

Hats are peculiar things. They get
to be a part of one. So much so do
they become merged in the personality
of their wearers that frequently gentle-
mtU sitting for posed photographs keep
their hats on during the business. True,
this is supposed to give a certain swank,
as one gets from being photographed,
pipe in hand, in a reflective mood. Any-
way, hats, I say. get to be part of one

Last Friday night my hat disappeared.
It disappeared from its peg during the
time I had momentarily separated from
it. I do not choose to think that it was
lost, or stolen; I lean rather to the be-
lief that it strayed, that it was mislaid.
For I found another hat left in place of
mine. It was, to my eyes, a disagree-
able thing, and I could not welcome it to
the place in my heart that my old hat
had occupied. I felt no tenderness for
this hat. I did not smooth its nap on my
sleeve as I bad that of my old hat. I
could not bring myself to cock it over
my left eye—the very eye over which my
old hat had so often been cocked. I
could not do this: I threw the bat in a
corner and borrowed an undersized cap
from one of my companions.

Plan Fountain of
Life Saving Corps

All women who have passed their
Senior Life Saving tests are request-
ed to sign their names and the place
of passing them on the poster in the
lobby of Ida Noyes hall, in order that
some sort of Life Saving corps may
be formed at the University. There
are already about ninety names sign-
ed on the chart, and as many more
are hoped for. If the women take an
interest in this organization, it will
probably be possible for Chicago to
have a Life Saving Corps which will
rival that of any other University.

SOUTH CAROLINA, LOUISIANA TO SEND
ENTRIES FOR INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET

Expect Forty High School Teams to Compete; Charleston
Wins Invite as South Carolina

Entry

By Victor Rotems

Preparations for the Eighth Annual
National IntersCholastic Basketball Tour-
nament, which have, thus far, been in
silent and abstract formation, assumed
direct proportions when the initial group
of invitations were despatched by H. O.
Crisler, manager of the affair. Charles-
ton, South Carolina: Mesa, Arizona;
Brackenbridge High of San Antonio,
Texas ;«Duval High of Jacksonville. Flo-
rida, and New Trier High, Kenilworth,
Illinois; Oakridge Louisiana; Birming-
ham, Alabama, are the first high schools
to to invited to participate in the tour-
nament which begins March 30 and con-

tinues through April 3 at the
gymnasium. They are cxpectel
their acceptances in a few days.

Expect Forty Teams

It is expected that 40 teams
invited with a representation of

champions. Other teams to complete the
list will be selected fro mthe winners of
such events as the Tufts College, New
England Tournament; the University of
Pennsylvania Tournament; the Cotton
States Tourney, and the Rocky Mountain
Tournament. With all the state cham-
pions and the winners of these inter-
state meets coming to the National Tour-
nament, the cream of the basketball
world will congregate at Bartlett.

The contestants will be guests of the
University and the various fraternities.
A banquet for all the players, coaches,
and faculty representatives will be held
in Hutchinson Hall on the night before
the tournament. Educational tours of
the city, including visits to all of the
big business enterprises in Chicago, will
be made so that the boys will be more
than repaid in an educational way for
the time they spend away from their
class rooms. A number of near-by thea-
ters will be open for free enter-
tainment for all those players who wish
to avail themselves of this courtesy.

Consolation Round

The tournament will be conducted, as
in the past, in two sections, a tournament
for the championship, and a consolation
tournament held for the losers of Hit
first round. The sending of the invita-
tions is being delayed as the managers
are awaiting the results of the state

CAGE SEASON ENDS AS
IOWA PLAYS GOPHERS

With the Iowa-Minnesota game yet
to be played, the Big Ten cage season is
almost over for another year. This final
game is an important one because it will
have a bearing tin the championship of
the conference. If Iowa wins there wi’l
be no less than four teams in a tie for
first honors with eight won and four
games lost. Purdue, Michigan, and In
diana already have a share of the title
so it really does not make much differ-
ence whether Iowa joins them or not.
To Iowa, however, this game means
everything, and to Minnesota it means
a lot as they have been hugging the cel-

title with ease. They were represented
in the 1923 meet but went down before
the Charleston Bantams.

Torrington Speedy

From the basis of records to date it
seems very likely that Torrington, Con-
necticut, will go far in the coming tour-
ney. This outfit went to the round be-
fore the semi-finals in the National last
year, and is considered as the strongest
team in New England this season. Its

here; over Schenectady, and Naugatuck,
the team gained lasting renown by de-
feating Passaic.

WIN INTER-CLASS
WIN IN BIG MEET

If the Freshmen can’t play basket-
ball, at least they can swim, as they
proved yesterday by winning the
class splash championship in three-
swimming meets held this quarter.
The total scores for the three meets
were Freshman 104 1-4, Seniors 98,
Sophomores 66, and Juniors 40 1-2.
The rivalry between the Freshmen
and the Seniors was intense, and the
Freshies only won the last meet by
the narrow margin of a half a point.

The events of the meet were
plunge for distance, won by the
Freshmen; side stroke for form, won
by the Seniors; 40 yard free style,
won by the Seniors; Breast stroke for
form, won by the Freshmen; 20
yard back stroke, won by the Fresh-
men; diving, won by the freshmen,
20 yard free style, won by the Se-

Today — Just In
Time For Exams.

Vol. 26 No. 89

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, TUESDAY, MARCH 16, 1926

REV. AITCHISON
DROPS DEAD ON
STREET CORNER

Assistant To President Is
Overcome On Way To

Suburban Train

The Rev. Dr. John Aitchison, assist-
ant to the president of the University,
dropped dead yesterday morning.
Heart trouble brought instantaneous
death to the scholar and educator as
he crossed Lake Park avenue and
Fifty-third street, on his way from the
Aitchison residence at 5524 Kimbark
avenue to the Illinois Central subur-
ban station at East 53rd street.

At one time general director of the
board of promotion of the Northern
Baptist church convention, Dr. Aitchi-
son had been known over the entire
country for years as the man who
handled funds for the missionary work
of the entire Baptist church in Amer-
ica. He came to the University two
years ago at the request of the late
President Ernest DeWitt Burton, to
advise the administration and help in
the campaign for a $17,500,000 en-
dowment and maintenance fund.

Death Is Shock

His sudden death is a shock to the
entire administration of the I niver-
sity as well as to the student body,
among whom he was well known.

“Dr. Aitchison has made friends
with all the members of the Univer-
sity with whom he has come into con-
tact,” eulogized James Hayden Tufts,
vice-president of the University and
colleague of the deceased. “He was
a man of marked ability in organiza-
tion; his personality, was character-
ized by refinement of manner, genial-
ity, and sincerity, and he rapidly
proved the man for his position. His
death is a very great loss to the Uni-
versity, and I do not know where we
can look for a successor.”

“He was a man of the highest in-
tegrity and personal lovableness,” said
Trevor Arnett, of the Board of Trus-
tees. His tremendous ability serves to
emphasize the shock his death has giv-
en us.”

Dr. Aitchison was 65 years old. His
only son, John, is a student of the
University. His wife, Estelle, and two
sisters and two brothers survive him.

LYTLE STARTS WORK
ON ANNUAL PREP
TRACK MEET

Stuart Lytle, chairmen of the 1926
IntersCholastic track meet, requests
that all men who desire to work in
the meet submit their names and ex-
perience to him before spring vacation.
Lytle can be found at the Psi Upsilon
house.

“There is a great future in Inter-
scholastic work,” declares Lytle. “Not
only does it yield highly profitable ex-
perience but leads to prominent cam-
pus positions. The work entails du-
ties in various departments of the
meet. Almost any past experience fits
a man for the job.”

Lytle further urges that all frater-
nities send their freshmen and sopho-
mores out. particularly those interest-
ed in the work and not at present cn •
gaged in any major activities.

SWISS PROF. FAVORS
UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE

That Esperanto, the proposed in-
ternational language, is one factor in
solution of international differences,
an aid in teaching foreign languages,
and an important part of child edu-
cation is the belief of Prof. Pierre
Bovet of the Jean Jaques Rosseau
institute in Geneva, Switzerland,
which he expressed before an audi-
ence at the University of Iowa.

He says that since children’s pre-
judices are acquired, that an under-
standing among children of different
races and nationalities brought about
through an international language
would do much to alleviate those
biases.

Phoenix “License
Number” Appears
On Campus Today

The “License Number” of the
Phoenix, the last issue to appear this
quarter, comes out today. Cover by
Bill Cotant, stories by Morgenstern
and Handschy and others, interior dec-
orations by Bennett and Dewey, it is
indeed a notable issue in the opinion
of the editors.

Handschy, the editor in chief, an-
nounces the discovery of a new artist,
Caldwell Dewey. He contributed a
few drawings to the last issue and is
well represented in tills one.

The cover by Bill Cotant gives the
key to the issue. One of the other
features consists of some excerpts
from the “Ladies Magazine” of 1850-
’56 showing that the nineteenth cen-»
tury was not all that it is cracked up:
to be, either morally or anything else,
according to Handschy.

For this issue Handschy has also
drawn a female head supposed to be
typical of the college girl. The accom-
panying satirical poem was written by
an anonymous sophomore.

having accepted last week.

All these teams are state cham-

Mesa has won the state champion-
ship of Arizona for four consecutive
years and has a remarkable team this
year. They participated in the 1923
Interscholastic, winning two games
before being eliminated by New Trier
of Chicago. Aside from being the
best team the sagebrush state ever
tured out, they are remarkable for
their size, having four men standing
over six feet and weighing over 170
pounds.

Are Midgett

Durham, North Carolina, is dis-
tinguished by having the “Midget”
team of the tourney. Last year, they
were one of the best teams in the
Tourney, winning from Helena,
Montana, and Devils Lake, North
Dakota before being eliminated by
Laramie, Wyoming in an overtime
game. What they lack in size is
made up for in a fast passing attack.

first tryouts for this year’s Blackfriars
production, it was announced today by

the first competition for cast parts
will take place. On the following day,

the production until this time.

large cast is called for. Accordingly,
Mr. Coleman requests that all inter-

INSTITUTE LECTURES

Dr. Quincy Wright, professor of
Political Science and Dr. Wcrritt Wal-
lace Charters, professor of Education,
will close their respective series of
public lectures, which they have de-
livered during the past month in the
Club room of the Art Institute.

Dr. Wright will speak on Thursday

Relations”, discussing whether the
United States can carry out foreign
policies effectively without amend-
ment to the constitution. On Mar. 21

ing the method by which friendly rela-
tions between parents and children

“End Cribbing by
Strong Student
Opposition” - Cole

“A strong student sentiment in op-
position to cribbing is the only ii’ieans
of putting an end to unfair efforts at
obtaining better grades,” answered Dr.
Fay Cooper Cole of the department of
Anthropology when asked his opinion
on the subject. This answer comes in
response to many inquries on a sub-
ject which has gained much publicity
both here and at Northwestern uni-
versity.

‘‘Development in a University itself
should create a student body willing to
uphold the principles of common hon-
esty. ^Cribbing and the need for proc-
tors are hardly practices worthy of
university men and women,” contin-
ued Dr. Cole. Control by the students
themselves without interference from
the faculty, Dr. Cole believes, is the
best way to solve this problem. If
they are not able to handle the situa-
tion then student government is merely
a theory and not applicable to fact.

PRINCETON TO

DEBATE HERE

•	———_-^_

Consider Question of Military
Training in Colleges

Princeton University debating
team has accepted the invitation of
the varsity team for a debate to take
place here sometime during April.
T.youts for the team will be held
the first week of the spring quarter,
and the exact date and time will be
announced in an early issue of The
Daily Maroon. All undergraduates
of the University with nine or more
majors are eligible for the team try-
outs.

The question to be discussed will
be, “Resolved: that the military train-
ing in the universities and colleges
of the country is a detriment to
peace.” The split team system which
is an innovation at the University
will be used. The night of the debate
one Princeton man will join the
ranks of the University team, while
a local man will aid the visitors.

Y. M. CALLS FOR
OLD CLOTHES FOR
SETTLEMENT DRIVE

Old clothes for the needy, is the
call of the Y. M. C. A. in a campaign
to collect cast off garments and to
distribute them at the University Set-
tlement house which can in its turn,
see that they reach those who lack
them.

As the quarter closes, the Y. M.
C. A. asks that students leave any
old clothes which they will not need
at the office of the Association, in-
stead of taking them home to be
stored or thrown away. This facili-
tates students who are moving, giv-
ing up rooms, going home, or “clean-
ing-up” to get rid of excess useless
wearing apparel and at the same time
is of definite, assitsance to the needy
of the city.

Another call has also been received
at the Y. M. C. A. office with the
request that it be passed on to the
students of the University. Sum-
mer camps for Boy Scouts are search-
ing for reliable leaders to act as
councillors for the boys.

Issue, to start the Meet off, and to
welcome the boys who are entered
in the events.

WHISTLING STONES
GET UNDER WAY

It was Friday afternoon in The
Daily Maroon office.

In
once
roon
noon
and

fact it is Friday’ afternoon
every week in The Daily Ma-
office. But this Friday after-
was something unto itself—
to the Whistle Club. For

where all is generally silent and de-
serted on that one day each week,
a meeting of assorted wits buzzed*
at length under the chairmanship of
Mr. Terrible Turk.

And the Whistle Club was form-
ally organized with a howling suc-
cess that actually exceeded the vivid
imagination of Colonel Stone, who
expected the campus en messe.

Twenty-five contributors—all
them famous in Whistle cii

many renowned outside campus lit-
erary striving—appeared and put in
a word or two here and there.

The Whistle Club has tabled the
recently received invitation to join
a national columnists’ fraternity.
Until it is better organized, at least,
the group will remain local. A com-
mittee, appointed in today’s column,
will decide on the fundamental pol-
icies of the club .

Annual Concert
Of Glee Club to

Be “Different

The old type of Glee club concert is
going out of style. The Glee club,
at its next appearance, April 30 at
8:30 in Mandel hall, will inaugurate
the ultra-modern Glee club recital.

Formal clothes will be replaced by
white duck trousers; Polly Wolly
Doodle All Day will be replaced by
light cassical and melodiously synco-
pated music. Lighting effects will be
used to assist the manager in his ar-
rangement of effects.

The fifty members of the Maroon
Glee club will open their spring con-
cert behind a drawn curtain and will
use recently developed and demon-
strated improved methods of creating
an opening impression.

Profiting by their previous experi-
ences with only moderately filled
houses the publicity committee of the
Glee club is making determined efforts
to fill the auditorium at their next pub-
lic appearance. Seats will be allotted
to fraternities and clubs.

DISPLAY PAINTINGS
OF CHINESE PERIODS

“A picture is a voiceless poem, a
poem is a vocal picture,” so runs the
proverb of China bearing the secret
of her art. This spirit expressed in
the old Chinese proverb is illustrated
in the Chinese paintings now on dis-
play in the Y. W. C. A. room of Ida
Noyes hall. The pictures have been

loaned for exhibtiion by Mr.

Uring Tasi of New York.

Co-ordination of mind, eye

Las

ever

guided by the heart, has engeneder-
ed the richness and delicacy of ev-
ery Chinese pictorial masterpiece ac-
cording to Edward F. Rothchild, in-
structor in the Art department. The
paintings represent three great pe-
riods in Chinese art. Five are of
the T’sang period from 618 to 906
A. D., seven were painted in the Sung
period from 960 to 1277 A. D. and
two are of the Yuam period from
1277 to 1368 A. D. The silk on
which the pictures are painted is
very fragile and visitors have been
asked not to handle the paintings.

By Stewart McMullen

For the first time in the history of
the University the convocation will
be broadcast. Station WMAQ has
arranged with Mr. John Van
Zant, director of radio broadcasting
at the University, to put the annual
exercises on the air at 3:30 today
from Mandel hall.

Two hundred and fifty-one degrees
will be conferred by the President
today. One hundred and eleven of
these will be Bachelor degrees,
twenty-nine master’s degrees, and
eleven Doctor’s of Philosophy. The
law schools will confer seven degrees
of Doctor of Jurisprudence and one
degree of bachelor of law. The
medical schools will confer 37 de-
grees of Doctor of Medicine and 55
four year certificates.

Tufts To Preside

Vice President J. H. Tufts will
preside over the convocation. It will
in all probability be his last public
appearance as a vice president of the

University, as his
dered last quarter,
the first of April.

The convocation

resignation, ten-
is to take effect

address will be

delivered by Walter A. Strong, pub-
lisher of the Chicago Daily News.
His subject will be “Newspapers and
the New Age.”

Number Doubled

Over twice as many degrees are to
be conferred today as were con-
ferred last year. 121 graduated in
1925 and 250 will graduate in 1926.

Tickets for the Convocation may
be secured on application at the
President’s Office. Although the al-
lotment has been pretty well distri-
buted, as is customary in the Univer-
sity, among the graduating students
and their families and friends, a few
tickets are still available to those who
will apply for them.

DENVER U. GLEE CLUB
CAUSES BOYCOTT
ON THEATRE

Singing of the Glee club of the
University of Denver in local theatres
was recently made taboo.when the la-
bor union of the city declared a boy-
cott of the theatres. In spite of the
fact, the club insisted upon fulfilling
their contract

(That the Glee club did not realize
the quality of their voices was evidenc-
ed by the fact that the club declared
that had not anticipated this trouble
as a result of appearing in local thea-
tres. When union officials approached
officers of the club attempting to in-
duce them to cancel their engagements
the club still insisted upon fulfilling
the contract.

As a result of this episode labor un-
ions have sponsored discussion on
the relations of organized unions to
higher education hut as to the present
state of the enlightened Glee club the
Denver Daily is not informative.
