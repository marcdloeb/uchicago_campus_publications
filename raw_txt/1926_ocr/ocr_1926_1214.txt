NAME NEW PUBLICITY HEAD

It is curious, i observe, what things
make a fraternity “rate.’’ Not only
do age. fur coats, good food, a nice
house, and exclusiveness of clientele
enter into the final evaluation, but
cVen such an apparently distant thing
from the accepted inventory of stock
and good-will as adverse comment
(taking sometimes the form of consid-
erably worse than mild razzing) counts
as a factor in determining frat-club
prestige. This is a strange thing, cer-
tainly, yet I have undeniable proofs
that it is true. Take any of those frats
which you consider to rate up with
any of them, and you will find that,
almost in proportion as they represent
what passes for "exclusiveness’’ —
maybe “snobbishness” would be a bet-
ter word—in the campus mind, they
are made subjects of ribald songs, low
jests, and generally obscene and derog-
atory reference. Apparently they have
the good-will of no one; seemingly
they would appear to be looked down
upon. Not so! not so! as Dean Dorn
is accustomed to remark with em-
phasis.

♦ ♦ * *

Indeed, as 1 have stated, almost the
converse of this is true. The songs,
jests and reference I have cited are
merely evidences of the esteem, the
ranking in the popular mind, which the
subjects of them enjoy. If the, folk
of the market-place (or of other fra-
ternities) did not think that the clubs
whose lowliness they shout about in
song and story amounted to something
they most emphatically would not
bother themselves with those clubs.
No, sir; they would sing songs about
some other organizations instead. To
back up the point 1 make, I cite that
exhibition of the more or less unvar-
nished truth that appeared early this
year in The Phoenix under the cap-
tion, "The Truth About the Eating
Clubs.” Logically, those frats and clubs
exposed in that article should have felt
the righteous indignation that anyone
who has not heard the bitter truth
about him—after there had existed
all around the tacit understanding that
that truth would not be spoken, how
much it might be FELT. Yet this
was not the case. Indeed, I heard all
around great indignation expressed by
members of the men’s and women’s
organizations that were not mention-
ed in the expose over the fact that
they were not given the same consider-
ation as those listed in the article had
been. They felt piqued, even slighted.
If you doubt the truth of my general
assertion regarding this odd manner
of gaining prestige, just check up on
how many low songs are sung about
Nu Eta Epsilon, or how many tales
of scandal related about dear old
I heta Tau Kappa, and see for your-
self.

1	here has from time to time been
a request forwarded in to me from the
inner office that this column occasion-
ahy engage itself with little items of
interest concerning various people—
that it be more or less of a column of
«hat we call “personals.” The idea
is fundamentally a good one, and I
am rather sorry that it has received
so little attention up to now. But from
now on, there will, as occasion re-
quircs, be just such a collection of
news notes printed here. It’ll run
something like this:

SOPHOMORES DON
CRIMSON PLUMES

FOR CLASS SPIRIT

Feathers Will Be Sold
After Chapel; Adopt

New Color

They're here!

Three hundred and fifty bright crim-
son feathers, ten inches long, to adorn
the hats of members of the sophomore
class as emblems of class spirit have
arrived and will be sold today after
chapel by representatives of the soph-,
omore council for fifteen cents each.

Not to be outdone in spirit by the
senior men who carry canes every
Thursday, the sophomore class coun-
cil went a step farther and devised an
insignia which may represent both the
men and the women of the class. Af-
ter considering many other sugges-
tions for a symbol, including jackets,
shirts, scarfs, flowers, beret caps and
' derbies, a majority on the council were
in favor of crimson feathers to be
worn in the hats of the Sophomores.
The feathers may be worn as they
come, ten inches long, or they may
be broken off to the length desired
by the wearer.

Aside from deciding upon the class
insignia, the sophomore class council
has chosen the color of the feathers
as the future class color, to be kept
through the remaining years at the
University.

As the Sophomores want distinction
on campus from the other classes,
both the color and the conspicuous
nature of the feathers will provide this.

Hungarian Composer
Gives Piano Recital

At Symphony Today

Ernst von Dohnanyi, pianist, com-
poser, and conductor will be heard in
a piano recital today at 4:15 at Man-
del hall, on the program of concerts
by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
Four of his own compositions, three
by Chopin, one by Brahms and one by
Brahms and Dohnanyi comprise the
program.

In 1894, Dohnanyi entered the Royal
Hungarian Academy of Music in Bud-
apest, where he made his first appear-
ance as a composer. At the age of
twenty he won the King’s Prize with
his Symphony in F. Desnite his start
as a composer, Dohnanyi continued
his pianistic work, making a concert
debut in 1897, in Berlin.

Tickets at half price will be avail-
able for students in Cobb 202.

REYNOLDS CIGARET
SALES DO NOT PAY

“Barely making expenses,” was the
report from the cigarette counter on
the second floor of the Reynolds club
yesterday. The reason for the deficiency
of customers is said to be that many
of the men about campus do not know
the sale of tobacco on the University
grounds has been permitted.

BEANS JUST LIKE
LIQUOR SAYS SCOTT

Pork and beans are no worse than
liquor if taken in moderation,
quotes Arthur P. Scott, University
history professor, better known to
the populace as Artie Scott.

Professor Scott was talking of
European influences on the East
and in telling of the habits with
which the Easterners afflicted them-
selves.

Sanction of a rebel junior prom

out from the office of Mrs. Winifred
G. Richardson, dean of women at
Northwestern. The threat of a
group of fraternities to boycott the
official prom marks the high spot
in the struggle between the' two ri-
val groups of fraternities who fight
for the control of campus o ces at
each student election.

THE DAILY MAROON

WM. MORGENSTERN
SELECTED TO PILOT!
DEPT.OFPUBLICITt

Comes To Campus January 1
To Fill Place Left Vacant

By Pierce

The appointment of William V.
Morgenstern as director of Public Re-
lations and assistant to the president
was announced yesterday by the office
of President Mason. Mr. Morgen-
stern will succeed Russeel Pierce, who
recently resigned from the position of
Acting Director, which he has held
since the resignation of Henry Justin
Smith last February.

The new director is a graduate of
the University, having taken his Ph.
B. in 1920 and an LL.B, degree two
years later. He was one of the eight
men to win the Order of the Coif in
the law class in ’22, and was promin-
ent aS an undergraduate, being sport-
ing editor of The Maroon among other
things.

Mr. Morgenstern will probably take
up his new work the first of January.
At present he is a member of the Her-
ald and Examiner sports staff, with
which he has been connected for eight
years. He has been the Big Ten Con-
ference specialist of the Examiner dur-
ing that time, and has also followed
the Chicago National League ball
club. In addition Mr. Morgenstern
has represented the Southern Lumber-
man, a trade paper, in Chicago for sev-
eral years.

It is expected that his thorough ac-
quaintance with newspaper work and
with the University will make the new
director particularly valuable in his
Public Relations work.

Dean Dorn Defends
Faculty Members In

Senior Dinner Talk

“Some people’s idea of hell is a
tete-a-tete with an educator.”

That was the way in which Dean
Walter L. Dorn summarized the atti-
tude of university students towards
faculty members, when he spoke “In
Defence of Cadavers” at the Senior
dinner last Friday in Ida Noyes hall.
The average student, he claimed, re-
gards his instructors as cadavers. He
advocated a return to humanism and
to learning.

Judge Walter Steffen of the Cook
County Circuit court and a former
Maroon football captain, recalled the
days when the athletes gathered in
the athletic quarters on the third floor
and with a bucket of water greeted
all passing friends and acquaintances.
John Meyer, Senior president, and John
Allison, Phoenix editor were also on
the program.

SHAILER MATTHEWS

LECTURES TONIGHT

Dean Shailer Mathews, head of the
Divinity School, will lecture on “Paul
and the Life of the Spirit” at 6:45 to-
night in Fullerton Hall at the Art
Institute.

This is to be the last of a series of
lectures given under the heading “Cre-
ative Personalities,” sponsored by the
University College.

professor of philosophy at the Uni-

Thirty-eight thousand coal dealers
in the United States is an over supply,
believes Professor Taeusch, who has
made extensive study of the work and
is the author of a book on business
and professional ethics. Influx of new
members in any group jeopardizes the
standards and coal associations should
take steps to restrict membership.

showers of pennies and peanuts which
accompanied even the really good
numbers were hardly conducive to pro-
fessional conduct on the stage. How-
ever, neither the performers nor the
audience are to be censured. Both I
think were there in a spirit of fun and
good fellowship and it is ridiculous
even to try to criticize it from the pro-
fessional point of view.

WATER COLORS

SELF-TIMERS

TWO MEN

I AST FRIDAY EVENING the senior class had a dinner, a very
“ good dinner, incidentally, at which two men did most of the
talking. These two men, both of them intimately associated with
the University, represented two vostly different kinds of life. One of
them was Walter Steffen, one of the greatst athletes of his time, an
all-American half-back and at present coach of the only team which
beat Notre Dame this year and a judge in the Superior Court of Cook
County—very much a regular fellow and very much a man of affairs.
The other was Walter Dorn, dean in the undergraduate schools, in-
structor of history and scholar.

Judge Steffen was well received. He reminisced with the broad
and easy humor familiar to after-dinner speakers. He spoke of class
rushes, doings at the Botany Pond, football and honesty, as it is
related to monetary success. Dean Dorn was received somewhat
more mechanically. He started apologetically, but followed up with
something startling. He began to read a formal paper in defense
of the humanities as fields of interest. The paper was written and
read with enthusiasm, and shot through with an effective, if aca-
demic type of humor. But the dinner group was non-plussed. Un-
fortunately, American college groups are not accustomed to hearing
formal papers read at their meetings. And many of the listeners,
we suspected, were in a quandary about just what is included in
the humanities.” The Dean sensed the situation and brought his
paper to a premature close, to the regret of many in whom he struck
a spark of interest.

The two types of talking, and the two types of life represented
by these two men find their ready counterparts here on the campus.
Too often, men can be classed either as "regular guys” or as "book-
worms.” Both types of living are crammed full of interest, and have
in them most of the possibilities for the conduct of a good life.
We believe that the ideal college man, insofar as there can be an
ideal college man, should combine these kinds of life in his own
life, in the fullest measure. He should have a genuine love of foot-
ball, plus a genuine feeling for the intellectual adventure. He should
be smooth and yet be critical. Above all, the scope of things
which he appreciates should comprise the interest of both the Dean
Dorn and the Judge Steffen kinds of life.

WORK, FOR THE NIGHT IS COMING!

^WOODROW WILSON, when president of Princeton, told the fol-
lowing story, with a moral which is now applicable.

The college was struggling in the throes of an arduous evange-
lical campaign. It was ten days before the final examinations. The
revival was gradually approaching its climatic din. Aroused by a
great religious zeal, the students were ransacking dormitories and
club-houses, dragging forth Christians, atheists, agnostics, Moham-
medans, Swedenborgians, theosophists and other species of col-
legians. Suddenly they paused before a door, bearing a placard on
which was neatly printed: “Don’t bother me. I am a Christian, and
am preparing for the finals as all good Christians should.”

So now with all other campus activities and interests. Each
student should placard his door with the legend: "Don’t bother me.
My activity now is final examinations."



should
ization
wise,”

have a powerful enough organ-

to make all dealers do
says Professor Taeusch.

like-

Construct Code

Elimination of slip-shod business
methods and gambling conditions was
seen as a panacea for some of the
evils now present in the trade. “Con-
struct a definite instead of a general
code of ethics and follow that code,”
advises the Iowa educator.

A FREE TRIP TO
EUROPE

or cash commissions

The leading student tour organiza-
tion of America desires an agent on
this campus for the sale of its stud-
ent tours. Must be influenced at
school and have good personality.

SHOWS STRENGTH

OF BASKET TEAM

Work To Overcome Early
Season Faults; Mich.

Aggies Next

Saturday’s game with the Oak Park
“Y” displayed several early season
faults in the Maroons according to
Coach Nels Norgren. The defense,
doped to be very wrong, was, on the
contrary, unusually weak. The passing
at times flashy, was erratic, poorly
timed, and wild, while the floor work
was unimpressive. The basket shoot-
ing however, was good and was the
brightest feature of the tilt.

Weak On Tip-Off

Despite the fact that Chicago was
victor by only one point, the team
showed great possibilities. With hard,
serious work, a well-balanced aggre-
gation, strong both defensively and of-
fensively, can be developed. The most
serious handicap, which the Maroons
face at present, is their inability to get
the tip off. Coach Norgren states that
this drawback, due to lack of excep-
tionally tall men. will probably exist
all season.

Michigan State Next

The Oak Park game was a tough
opener. On the Y team were sev-
eral excellent players, who had fairly
good coordination. On next Saturday
the Maroons will face Michigan State
who, although defeated by Michigan,
is expected to put up a hard battle.

OVER EIGHTY MEN
TURN OUT FOR MAT
TEAM AT MADISON

Madison, Wisconsin., Dec. 4, 1926.—
The University of Wisconsin wrest-
ling squad is practicing diligently in
anticipation of the opening engage-
ment of the current season, a dual
meet wth Iowa at Iowa City on Jan.
15.

About eighty-five men, among them
several veterans from last year, are
working out each day on the mats
under the direction of George L. Hitch-
cock, wrestling coach.

Stiff competition is expected at
Iowa, according to Coach Hitchcock,
as seven letter men, one in each weight
will represent the Hawkeyes.

The Badger squad this year will be
built around William Splees, Madison,
Captain, Thomas Fortney. Wheeler,
Wis., and Wallace Cole ’27, Madison,
who are all former letter men.

TRIANON PATRONS TO
FROUC AT BALLROOM

NEXT CHRISTMAS EVE

Start Work On

New Stagg Track

By Bob Stern

Believe me or not, the first signs
of spring an already here. Over in
the vicinity of Stigg Field work has
started on the new three-phase-curve
running track. You may have been
noted during the last week that much
activity has been going on within the
walled confines of the staid old field,
bleachers have been torn down, goal
posts have been rooted up, the grassy
sward has been thoroughly blanketed
and curiously, wagon loads of cinders
have been carted in through the shad-
owed gates.

All of this is in preparation to build
a quarter mile running track that will
put Chicago in possession of the finest
faclity for holding interscholastics and
intercollegiate meets on a national
scale next spring. Coach Stagg has
personally supervised the construc-
tion work which has to date been
completed. When plans for the new
stadium with its mammoth grandstand
were drawn up he was confronted
with the difficulty of providing a new
track for future cinder meets. The
old path had to be torn away and not
enough space was left for a new' east
and west track with the old-circular
curves.

Whereupon Coach Stagg sought the
aid of three architects and evolved a
new' idea in running track construc-
tion. The track decided upon will
have a three-phase instead of a two-
phase curve at each and thus the
quarter will be squeezed into a space
hardly large enough for a fifth of a
mile of the old-circular path.

So that Chicago, in the spring, will
have an entirely new track prastige,
and the Unversity of Chicago Track
Interscholastic will be a real Chicago
interscholastic and not simply a Grant
Park event.

PURDUE GAGERS

IN OPENING TILT

I niversity students, especially those
who are not returning home for the
t hristmas holidays, have been invited
to frolic at a Christmas Eve party to
be held at the Trianon ballroom, 62nd
and Cottage Grove Avenue, ohe week
from Friday.

I'rec tickets to the party will be dis-
tributed through the courtesy of
Messrs. William Karzas and Andrew,
owners of the Trianon Ballroom, at
the Daily Maroon and Y. M. C. A.
offices Wednesday and Thursday

LaFayette, Ind., Dec. 4. — Minus
such familiar figures as George Sprad-
ling at forward and Carl Cramer at
center, Purdue’s 1926-27 basketball

gymnasium here this evening with the
State Normal quintet, of Terre Haute
as an opponent. Filling the shoes
of Spradling will be Bob Wilson, a
well built performer who played floor
guard last year, while Cummins, a
sophomore and a former Frankfort
high school flash, will appear at the
center job.

Veterans of a years’ experience will
be in the other positions, including

at the other forward, the hard playing

Laurels; Three Get

Insignias

The gym running track is very col-
orful these days, with green the pre-
dominating note, for the green shirts,
insignia of the freshman track team,
having been awarded to the men who
have shown the requisite ability. Quite
a few of the men have completed
their two time trials, while a still larg-
er number have won the first leg on
the coveted shirts by successfully
passing one test.

Schultze Shines

Schultze, the former Hyde Parker,
who won the Tnterclass 440 event in
the fastest time ever turned in by a
freshman, leads the freshman field
with the best performance of the sea-
son, varsity or otherwise. The gigantic
Weaver of Jonesboro, Arkansas, is also
outstanding, having won his shirt with
a heave of 41 feet 3 inches in the
shot put.

Get Numerals

Holt and Faris, both of U. High
have their numerals as well as green
shirts in the mile and cross country
runs. Together with Harry Ault they
were awarded numerals after their
work in a special cross country run
earlier in the season.

Hayden, another U. High lad. win-
ner of the interclass hurdle event,
Simpson of Hyde Park, third in the
pole vault and Whitney of Scott High
of Toledo, are the jumpers who have
w’on their honors. Kennedy of U.
High, due to a sprained ankle has un-
fortunately been unable to take his
second trial.

Meadows, winner of the interclass
50 yard dash, formerly of Lakeview,
and Gartside of U. High, both were
awarded places on the team in the
sprints. Wakeland of Moline, Illinois,
has also won his place recently, put-
ting the shot 37 feet. Numerous other
green shirts have been awarded and
an official list will be given out later.

I-M INKLINGS

Purple and Hawkeye Diamond-Men
Get Southern Trips; Plans Made

As Coach Frtz Crisler sends out em-
phatic statements that the Maroons
will go south on a spring training
jaunt, comes word from two rival
camps, Northwestern and Iowa, that
they will enjoy the benefits of practice
under the ruddy Southern sun.

The Hawkeyes will desert the cold
northern diamonds. Between April 10
and 19. At that time they will have
already practiced for three months in
the new University field house.

University of Mississippi of Oxford
will be the first Dixie team to be met
April 11 and 12. A short rail journey
wll lead the lowans to Clinton, where
on April 13 and 14 they will encounter
Mississippi College. At Starkville, a
double header will be played with Mis-
sissippi A. and M. April 15 and 16,
and the tour will be concluded with a
tilt with St. Louis University, April
18.

Iowa has made trips to the South
for the last two years which have
proved very profitable and in which
they have been victorious 7 out of 9
times.

The Purple’s trip will start the 9th
of April and be completed by the 18,
after which the team will rest up for
their first game with Michigan. Twen-
ty schools in almost every state south
of the Mason and Dixon line have
been corresponded with, among which

Dr. Molander has announced that
Bartlett and Unversity High Gyms
are open for practice for Intramural
teams for the remainder of the quar-
ter.

Any team which wish to practice
may do so by registering at the In-
‘ramural office one day previous to
the work out.

Both fraternity and non-fraternity
organizations have started drilling and
an excellent season is predicted.

All Intramural practice is conducted
only between seven and ten in the
evenings.

“Stadiumenza” Not
A New Disease

An article appearing in the Daily
Northwestern compares the modern
stadium of today with those of Greece
and Rome wherein the “football
heroes” of old contested. It stated
that at present, there are, in this coun-
try, 10 stadia with a seating capacity
of 50,000 or more. The largest of them
is the Yale bowl, which will accom-
modate 80,000; Soldiers’ field, holding
100,000; and the Sesquicentennial sta-
dium at Philadelphia, which has held
a crowd of 140,000.

The stadium or Olympia seated
45,000, a larger one at Athens held 69,-
000, one at Palatine seated 30,000, the
Coliseum accommodated 87,000, and
the largest, the Circus Maximus, held
250,000 and some claim 450,000 spec-
tators. These stadia were originally
constructed in wood and then rebuilt
with marble at enormous costs. They
were first put up several centuries B.
C. and used until about 1150 A. D.

final • arrangements are made North-
western will have six to eight games

Only the fittest survived in the finals
of the Annual Intramural Wrestling
tournament Friday afternoon in Bart-
lett Gym. The three teams tying for
first place with five points each are:
Delta Sigma Phi, Phi Gamma Delta,
and Lambda Chi Alpha.

Individual Winners

In the 118 pound class Winfrey took
first, Landis second, and Yaeger third.
In the 128 pounders Laverde copped
first, Fishman second and Burkhart
third. In the 138 pound finals Mikesh
took first, Marsh second, and Roy
third. The 147 pairings resulted in
Wilson first, Haywood second, and
Ray third. In the 160 pound class the
results were Shangnon first, Tayson
second, and Earsmus third. The 177
pound (battles resulted in Steunkeo
winning first and Zablen taking sec-
ond. In the heavy weights Semmerl-
ing won first, Proudfoot second and
Eikenberry third.

Harry Ingwerson, manager of the
tournament, announces that the medals
for the individuals will be distributed
as soon as they arrive and an an-
nouncement will be put in the Maroon.

THAT’S why Camel is the most
popular cigarette ever made. In
all tobacco history there has never
been a cigarette preference like
Camel’s. Nothing is too good or
expensive that will make Camels
the world’s finest smoke.

Camel is the friendliest cigarette
ever made. From early morning to
night’s last reluctant parting you
just can’t smoke enough Camels
to tire the taste. Camels are the
celebrated smoke that brought an

end forever to cigaretty after-taste.

If you’ve not yet learned how
really satisfying a cigarette can be,
just try Camels. Into this one cig-
arette the world’s largest tobacco
organization puts every good qual-
ity that could be wished for in a
cigarette. All the mild and mellow
fragrance. The most perfect
blending. The utmost in smoking
enjoyment and contentment,
regardless of price.

Their epaulets are silver
Their buttons silver, too.

Face to face they’re standing

Their rapiers brandished high
And shout their curses to the winds

COMPLEX CAUSE OF
MENTAL INFERIORITY
OF AMERICAN NEGRO

The pure bred American negro is
mentally inferior to the w’hite man
largely because of an inferiority com-
plex, declares Professor Charles C.
Nutting, veteran zoologist of the Uni-
versity of Iowa.

Intelligence and alertness of the
West Indian black impressed itself
upon the Iowa professor after several
visits to the Bahamas and Barbadoes.
Complete white dominance of the
West Indian islands has not lessened
the self-respect and reliance of the
colored people and there is a greatly
lessened spirit of inferiority.

Both the American and West Indian
blacks sprang from the same African
stock but the former has cultivated
the feeling of inferiority down through
the years. Professor Nutting points
has this feeling eve nt>onvh his out-
out that the American negro always
ward manner may be insolent and
self-assuring.

In Professor Nutting’s classes, ne-
groes from the West Indies have done
“A” work, similar to that of white
scholars but an American colored man
has never reached that pinnacle in
zoology study at the University of
Iowa.

Improvement is going forward con-
stantly. says Professor Nutting, who
believes that n tme the Amercan ne-
gro will ose much of his inferiority
complex. Then his intellectual nature
will develop until it is on a par with
that of his West Indian brother.
