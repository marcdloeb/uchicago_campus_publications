WHAT OF

One of the biggest faults in the
life of this college, as I see it, is the
lack of intimacy between the pro-
fessor and his students. Humbly I
state the fault, and humbly I pro-
pose a way of rectifying it. I am,
this quarter, in the classes of two
gentlemen who have always a large
following—Mr. Philip Schuyler Al-
len and Mr. James Weber Linn. In
Mr. Allen’s class there are, I should
estimate, about eighty of the better
minds of the school, and Mr. Linn’s
disciples run even higher—well into
the three figures, as the boys say.
It is obvious (and both Mr. Allen
and Mr. Linn admit it) that those
who teach such hordes cannot pos-
sibly hope to ever fully know and
understand each individual student
of the mob. Possibly they don’t want
to; I could understand such a view-
point.

* * ♦ •

But I do not really think such is
the case. Both Mr. Linn and Mr.
Allen (and many other professors
situated as they are, too) are not
only ready, but are actually desir-
ous of setting up contacts with the
boys who come to their lecture rooms
with open minds and (frequently)
open mouths. If there is no other
common ground between professor
and student, there at least is the old
argument that, after all, both are
human. And the cause of humanity
has been offered as an argument for
far worse things than professors’ teas
in the past. /

• ♦ • •

At Yale (that mecca of the older
intellectuals and the younger toss-
pots) it is traditional that Sunday
afternoons be devoted to open-
house affairs at the professors’
houses, where, amid tea .cups, pro-
fessors’ wives, and Huntley and
Palmer biscuits, the professor and
the boys get to know each other bet-
ter. At Illinois, the practice does
not flourish in an open state, but
professors’ pink tea is bootlegged
pretty freely about. Prof. Bruce
Weirick, one of the pedagogues with
less of a custom-built mind than is
usual among the educators of Cham-
paign County, for instance, is al-
ways ready to give ear (and even
tobacco) to any of the boys at the
Greatest State University who hap-
pen to need a hand up in surmount-
ing their intellectual doubts, fears
and inhibitions. And in other cen-
ters of learning, too, the practice of
student and teacher getting together
on terms of .fellowship (or at least
acquaintance) is not unheard of.

♦ * ♦ ♦

But at Chicago nothing has ever
been done along the lines I have
laid down. Possibly their students
discourage the professors; possibly
the professors are a clannish lot;
possibly the students are. Whatever
the reason is, the required contact
has not been set up to any degree cal-
culated to make the world a better
and happier place. True, a profes-
sor has offered us a bit off the cho-
colate bar he was munching, and
another has partaken of midnight
milk and schneken with us, but
these are merely exceptions that
prove the rule. The rest of the
scholarly fellows keep to themselves.

* * ♦ ♦

My suggestion to alter the situa-
tion is simple. It merely asks of
some of the leading personalities of
the school—Linn, Allen, Huth, Moul-
ton, Howland, Wilt (but there are so
many of them!)—well, that they
start the movement. The method of
the get-togethers, should I submit,
follow the Yale plan. If the profes-
sors will promise not to serve up
Postum and A. & P.’s Best tea at
their brawls, I will guarantee to lend
my presence to the affairs. That, at
least, ought to give things a start.

LONDON BISHOP ON CAMPUS

OFFICIALS SAY
THEY WILL NOT

PROHIBIT CARS

Vice-President Woodward
Assures Students

Own Autos

Because transportation in the city
is bad enough without such a prohi-
bition, and because it would be im-
possible to enforce such a rule in a
city of Chicago’s size and nature, the
faculty has decided not to prohibit
the use of automobiles by students,
according to Vice-President Wood-
ward.

Three American universities, Illi-
nois, Michigan and Ohio State, have
recently prohibited the use of auto-
mobiles by students, while among the
outstanding foreign institutions Ox-
ford has a similar rule of several
year’s standing. Mr. Woodward says
it is significant that all of these uni-
versities are located in cities much
smaller than Chicago.

Northwestern University recently
decided not to prohibit the use of
cars by students for approximately
the same reasons, although the offi-
cial announcement of the decision
was accompanied by a notice saying
that Northwestern students would
be expected to live up to the letter
of the law. This was caused by the
arrest of several students for viola-
, tion of the Evanston traffic rules.

Head Aide Back
on Campus After

Year in England

Edna Wilson, head college aide, who
has been studying abroad on a schol-
arslvp for the past year has returned
for her senior year at the Univer-
sity.

While in England, Miss Wilson
served on the National Council of Ed-
ucation at Cambridge in Newham Col-
lege. She has been given full credit
for her work which was in Botany and
Zoology.

When on campus previously, Miss
Wilson was a Federation Sponsor, had
charge of the Women's Fashion Show’
of 1925. algo secretary-treasurer on In-
terclub council and Sign of the Sickle.
She has a Phi Beta Kappa average for
her three years of college work. She
is a member of Chi Rho Sigma.

YALE MEN LEARN
TO LIKE RELIGION

Why Walk a Mile?

Dash To Reynolds

Fittingly kissing tradition good-
bye, dear old Reynolds, yesterday,
broke the hearts of thousands of
loyal Chicago alumni and students
when the lowly weed (known
here as the cigarette) was of-
fered for sale to all who could
afford the usual fifteen or twenty
cents per package.

The Reynolds Club for several
years has seriously debated the
question 4>f selling cigarettes to
save the three or four block walk
to the nearest cigar store but did
not actually gain the courage to
defy so called existing traditions
until this quarter.

So now University men and
women may smoke.(or burn) with
the Reynolds Club as they see fit.

MASON WELL;

RETURNS SOON

President, Ill Five Days,
Confined By Doctor

President Max Mason is recovering
very rapidly from his illness and
will be able to resume his normal
routine in a few days. This promis-
ing news was received from authen-
tic official sources, so that there need
be no alarm in regard to the health
of the head of the university.

It was learned from the same
sources that de-arrangement of the
stomach was the cause of the presi-
dent’s confinement. Not only is he
improving rapidly, but it was learned
that if it were not for his physician’s
orders confining him to his bed, that
he would be attending to his duties
as usual. President Mason’s illness
has already kept him in his -bed for
five days, and it will probably be at
least another week before his physi-
cian permits him to resume his work.

TWO PROFS. NAMED

NEW ASSISTANTS TO

HEAD OF HITCHCOCK

Henry W. Prescott, chairman of
the Latin department, and Captain
Jewett DeWitt Mathews of the Mil-
itary Science department have been
appointed assistant heads in Hitch-
cock hall, men’s dormitory, accord-
ing to an announcement made yes-
terday by Frank H. O’Hara, head of
the hall. Mr. Prescott is an ex-
president of the Quadrangle Club.

Jerome G.i Kerwin, assistant pro-
fessor of Political Science and Royal
W. Montgomery of the department
of Economics, will complete the staff
of assistants for the Hall.

Hitchcock Hall has been under the
management of Mr. O’Hara for the
past year and it is recognized as one
of the more popular men’s dormitories
at the University.

According to Mr. O’Hara, the pres-
ent quarter has drawn a larger number
of men prominent in campus activities
than past years have. No changes or
additions have been announced in the
management of other halls, to date.

Council Plans
Class Ballotings

Undergraduate Council will meet
today for the first time this quarter,
to arrange for the election of class
officers. The meeting will be held
at 3 :30 in Room 20, Classics.

Wendell Bennett, president of the
Council is very anxious that all mem-
bers be present as the meeting is one
of great importance.

Yale students for the first time in
two hundred and twenty-five years
were free to decide whether or not
they would attend chapel, Yale like
Northwestern University has yielded
to the demand of the student body
for making chapel non-compulsory.
According to the Yale Chronicle not-
withstanding this decision of the
Yale administration every seat in
Battell Chapel was filled for the mat-
riculation sermon

President Angell in speaking of
the step taken said that there were
undoubtedly a few who hold all re-
ligion in contempt and would conse-
quently be adverse to the old re-
quirement. It was also annoying in
many cases for the students to arise
early and to be made to attend Sun-
day chapel when otherwise he could]
spend his week-ends out of town. The I
decision would probably not have
been made if it had not been that
the supporters of Christianity
thought that the modern conditions
were harmful

Michelson fs and
Moulton ’s Work

Interest Hermit

In an almost deserted region of
Alaska, living in seclusion in an old
Norwegian fisherman, who has dwelt
alone for thirty years near Smugglers’
cove. He shies at conversation with
modern women, but brightens into en-
thusiasm at an opportunity to hear of
and discuss the latest works and writ-
ings of A. A. Michelsen and F. R.
Moulton, famous University scientists,
and talks freely in trigonometric and
astronomical parlance.

Two Chicago women who recently
returned from a trip to Alaska tell of
encountering the hermit scientist. Miss
Dorothy Judd, daughter of Dr. C. H.
Judd, head of the School of Educa-
tion at the University ,and Miss Mary
Ella Test, graduate of Vassar and
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. F. C. Test,
4620 Greenwood Avenue, were stroll-
ing about one evening when they met
the old fisherman. At first he dis-
played a little desire to talk, but when
the women in some inadvertent man-
n^r indicated a knowledge of cosines
and tangents he became enthusiastic.

(The women found that the old fish-
ertnan had read a large number of
Michelsen's and Moulton’s works and
hrexpiained the findings of Betelgeuse
by drawing cryptic figures in the sand.

Dean Breckinridge
Resigns Post To
Leila Houghteling

Miss Sophinisba P. Breckinridge,
professor of Social Economy and for-
mer dean of women in the colleges of
Arts, Literature, and Science, has re-
signed her deanship in favor of Miss
Leila Houghteling. Miss Breckinridge
will continue to be active in her work
in the department of Social Economy.

Dean Houghteling received her Ph.
D. degree in the department of Social
Service and Administration last March.
She is a graduate of Bryn Mawr and
has held the positions of Juvenile
Court and Probation officer and Su-
perintendent of the Haymarket district
of the United Charities. After receiv-
ing her degree in March, Dean Hough-
teling spent several months in travel
abroad.

Y. W. PLANS DRIVE

Deke Pledges Sing
By Light of Moon

Through the pitchy stillness of
Monday night, while fraternity
meeting, pledge “parties,” and
studying fests prevailed over the
campus, there came the voices of
marching men, marking a singular
and annual occasion—the pledge
sing of Delta Kappa Epsilon.

Followed by the entire active
chapter, the Deke pledges take
their yearly trek about campus
serenading the brother fraterni-
ties as an expression of good will
and inter-fraternity spirit. Com-
mon only to the Delta Delta Del-
ta chapter of D. K. E., this out-
burst goes unprotested, even en-
joyed, by the busy brother Greeks.

FIRST DANCE

OCTOBER 22ND

Score Club Selects Orchestra
Soon

Score club, honor society of the
Sophomore class, is giving the first
official all-university dance of the
year from 9 to 1, Friday, October 22.
A committee has been appointed to
> select the site for the annual affair
and is expected to make its report at
the weekly meeting of the organiza-
tion tomorrow night.

Bids are being considered from the
prominent orchestras throughout the
city. The committee is debating the
advisability of bringing in an out-
side orchestra. Several have sent in
estimates.

The dance this year will be under
the direction of committees instead
of a dance chairman as was formerly
the custom. Robert Harmon, presi-
dent of the club, will be in active
charge.

TOWER PLAYERS ASK
FRESHMEN TO COME
TO MEETING TODAY

All .freshmen who are interested in
dramatic work and who desire to
try out for Tower Players should re-
port at the first meeting, today at
2:30 in Mitchell Tower. The call
was sounded yesterday by Hadley
Kerr, recently elected president of
the organization. Tower Players is
composed of the male members of
the Dramatic Organization.

Plans will be laid and immediate
work will be started on productions
at this meeting. All productions, the
first of which will be “The Knight at
an End” and “The Monkey’s Paw,”
will be presented before the Drama-
tic Organization.

Other officers are Derwood Lock-
ard, vice-president; Arthur Urnstein,
secretary; Charles Cowan, treasurer;
and Herbert Bassett, member-at-
large.

Elect Publications

Board Head Today

The board of student publications
will hold a meeting at 1 o’clock in
the office of Mr. Frank O’Hara, di-
rector of student activities, to elect
a president. Editors and business
managers of The Daily Maroon, the
Cap and Gown, the Phoenix and the
Chicago Journal Commerce should
be present.

Balloting for the position began last
June, after the four publications had
elected their staffs. The attempts to
decide on a head at that time were
fruitless, but unanimity of opinion is
expected at today’s meeting.

NOTABLE TALKS ^
ON PROHIBITION

AND jhS. LIFE
University Honors Clergy-
man at Ida Noyes
Dinner

On a cross-continental tour to dis-
cover the ways and means of prohibi-
tion and the fundamentals of American
college life, the Right Reverend Win-
nington Ingram, Bishop of London,
reaches the campus at 3:15 today. Af-
ter an hour’s survey of the University
he will deliver a public lecture on
ffiese United States, in Bond chapel.

Members of the St. Marks Society
have arranged to take the Bishop on
a tour of the city and also of the Uni-
versity. A visit will be paid to Shail-
er Matthews, Divinity Dean.

Plan Dinner

There will be a dinner held in hon-
or of Reverend Ingram at 6:30 o’clock
tonight in Ida Noyes Hall. The few
tickets that are left for this dinner
may be obtained from the student
chaplain, Rev. Charles L. Street. Bis-
hop Griswold of the Episcopal Church
will represent the clergy at the dinner,
and the faculty members present will
include President and Mrs. Mason,
Mr. and Mrs. Woodward, Dean and
Mrs. Boucher and Mr. Frank O’Hara.

Guest of Many Schools

Bishop Ingram has been the guest
of many colleges and associations
while on his tour, among which was
the University of Iowa where he spoke
to eight thousand students. Last Mon-
day a great many university people
met the Bishop at a luncheon at the
LaSalle Hotel, where he also made an
address.

The Reverend George Craig Stewart
of the Episcopal Church will accom-
pany Bishop Ingram to Northwestern
University and on his way east.

Is Distinguished Visitor

’ Bishop Ingram is the first of a dis-
tinguished series of visitors who are
coming to the university campus this
fall. Crown Prince Gustav of Swe-
den was a summer visitor, but the ex-
tent of his activities on campus was
reviewing the colleges and receiving an
honorary degree.

T he last countryman of note of Bis-
ho plngram’s to visit the university
was the Crown Prince of Wales in
the spring of 1925.

SEVEN MAROON AD
POSTS STILL OPEN

Six or seven positions are open to
freshmen on the business staff of
The Daily Maroon, according to
Charles Harris, advertising manager.

The department is well satisfied
wdth the men who responded to their
first call for entering men but there
are openings for all wide aw’ake
freshmen who think they would like
to get into the advertising end of
the University daily.

Out of the men who try out four
will be retained for1 Sophomore
positions. A cup is awarded to the
man who sells the most advertising
during each quarter and besides the
honor of working on one of the lead-
ing activities on campus ,each man
is given a commission on all the ad-
vertising he ttfrns in.

The addition of the seven men, Har-
ris feels, will make competition fo rthe
places keener and will bring out more
clearly the merits of the candidates.

“The Meadville Theological School,
which has recently transfered itself
from the small town of Meadville,
where it has been for the past eighty-
two years,” stated Professor Fenn Jis
the latest of the seminaries to leave the
isolation of the country location for
the large University city, where con-
tacts with the facilities offered by the
University, and the advantages pre-
sented by the immediate proximity of
a great city with al! its complexities
and problems, are of inestimable value
to those who are training themselves
to meet the varied demands of the
modern ^ministry.

It was most fitting that Professor
Fenn deliver this address, for, when
minister of the First Unitarian church,
he first considered removing the Mead-
ville Theological School from its for-
mer location. The school is now lo-
cated at Woodlawn and 57th Street.

MAROON ADS OF
SERVICE TO BUYERS

IT HAPPENED the other day that an upperclassman, a student
who was new to the campus three years ago, chanced to be in
Mandel Hall when Dean Boucher concluded a short talk of advice
to freshmen with these words:—“Activities are all right, but you
must remember that they are merely the sideshows." Later that
same upperclassman was heard to say that he had been in the wrong
tent during his stay on the campus.

The freshman should be careful to apportion his time between
studies and activities in such a manner that the studies are not stint-
ed for time and the activities overdone. Personal ambition to make
good in campus activities is often supplemented by fraternity ambi-
tion. Fraternities have a perfectly understandable but often unwise
habit of “pushing" their freshmen into activities, willy-nilly. The
newcomer is in no position to see the road clearly. He is more apt to
overestimate the importance of extra-curricular work than to over-
estimate the work of the class room.

The time that a student spends on campus activities is rarely a
complete waste; too much time, however, spent in sideshows often
leads to poor grades and occasionally to dismissal from the Uni-
versity.

Before diving into the activity pond the freshman should ex-
periment with himself as a diver, and should ascertain the depth of
the water.

The zero hour from 7 to 8—the use-
less, boring, lonesome hour, the worse
hour of the day for'the women board-
ing off campus. The worst when it
should be the best, with no appoint-
ments or classes clammering to be
met, no need to worry about study for
a while at least is the perfect time
for something. But what?

An effort has been made by the
powers that be. who are not nearly as
cold or disinterested as they seem as
first, to fill this lost hour. Music will
be provided for a Social hour for
women from 7 to 8, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday evenings in
the theater of Ida Noyes hail. They
may dance if they wish or just
be lazy and comfortable, which per-
haps is the best way to spend an idle
hour following the example of the
Walrus and Carpenter when they dis-
cussed Sealing Wax and Cabbages
and Kings.

PEOPLE at football games, we have observed, have acquired a
definite technique of seeing the game. They sit down and stand
up according to a established scheme. And they stand up most
of the time.

The principle upon which the system works seems to be under-
stood by everyone. For end runs and forward passes, and for ev-

as one man. For line plunges and times out they stay seated.

The only truly scientific Football Game which has just
enough element of chance to fascinate and thrill all College

older grown-up Football fans.

First, most people who have paid for their seats would rather sit what it has to offer. For more

in them than stand in front of them; second, a great many of the
spectators have their view of the field momentarily obscured at the
most interesting flashes of the game; third, short people don’t see
any of the spectacular work at all.

Football crowds have become so habituated to the idea of
standing up and sitting down that they do it almost automatically.
They can, however, be cured. At the Dempsey-Tunney fight in the
Sesqui-Centennial Stadium one-hundred and thirty thousand people
sat through ten rounds of championship fighting, and stayed seated.
The announcers had requested them in advance to be courteous
enough to retain their seats.

Such a solution might be tried at the football games here. The
cheerleaders might ask the crowds to remember that there are peo-
ple sitting behind them who came to see the game and not to exer-
cise. Football crowds are not so lost to civilized courtesy that they
would disregard such a request. Everyone could see the game.

FRESHMEN BATTLE VARSITY IN RAIN

NEW ORGANIZATION FOR NON-GREEK I-M COMPETITION

LEAGUES FORMED
ON HIGH SCHOOL

ALUMNI BASIS

New System Devised To
Raise Level Of

Greek Play

By Hugh O. Potter

In order to increase the scope of
Intramural athletics in the University
of Chicago, non-fraternity men will be
organized this year into groups ac-
cording to the high schools from
which they were graduated, John
Howe, general manager of Intramural
athletics in the university, announced
yesterday.

Freshmen interested in organizing
teams for touchball, horseshoe pitch-
ing, and other intramural sports are
asked to report to the Intramural of-
fice on the west side of the University
running track before Saturday.

Will Create Interest

This is expected to help the^depart-
ment accomplish its purpose of increas-
ing the number of male students ac-
tively engaged in athletics. It will not
only give the non-Greeks a definite
plan for organization so that they
can band together in a systemized
way and get much better co-operation
in their team play, but will add great-
ly to the rivalry in the non-fraternity
group. Epecially will this be true of
the Hyde Park, Lindblom, and other
local high school alumni. This in-
creased rivalry will in turn make the
brand of play in the league of a higher
level, one that will threaten the hereto-
fore suptemacy of the Fraternity
Leagues.

New Award System

An added incentive for participation
in intramural athletics is offered by
that department in the shape of a
new type of participation banner.
Heretofore this award has been only
held for one year by the winning group
bnt now there is to be one trophy
given a year to be retained permanent-
ly by the winners. This highest of in-
tramural trophies is awarded to the
group which makes the highest num-
ber of points during the year in the
various branches of competition of-
fered by the department. It is import-
ant that teams be entered in every
event so that points will no tbe de-
ducted for defaults and forfeits.

The intramural booklet came off the
press yesterday. It contains the fall
schedule, new rulings and all necessary
information concerning the intramural
department.

Last night the intramural staff held
an informal banquet in Hutchinson
Commons.

Wanted—Referees

For I-M Contests

With the first touchball game
only a week away, the Intramural
Department has started intensive
work on the playing arrangements.

Bill King, in charge of officiating
for all Intramural contests this
quarter, has sent out the first call
for men who wish to serve as ref-
erees and umpires for the touchball
games.

According to King there are
openings for several men who have
had experience.

As in former years, all referees
will receive liberal payment for
their services. All those interested
in this chance to earn some extra
money should get in touch with
King immediately. He can be lo-
cated at the Alpha Sigma Phi
House, 5635 University Avenue, or
at the Intramural Office, Bartlett
Gym.

TARPON INVITES

WOMEN TRYOUTS

Judges Assist Entrants at
Open Hour Meetings

Tarpon club, an organization with
the twofold purpose of promoting an
interest in swimming and developing
proficiency in the| sport, has invited
all Freshman women as well as up-
per classmen, to try* out for-'member-
ship.

The Tadpole test, in which is em-
bodied only the rudiments of swim-
ming, must be passed by the candi-
date before she will be admitted to
membership. Tarpon judges, who
may be identified by white swimming
caps, will be present every Open
Hour to assist those trying out. Open
Hour meets Tuesdays and Thursdays
from 4:30 to 5 and Fridays from 3
to 4 in the pool in Ida Noyes hall.
Tarpon club meetings will be held
every Friday, from 12 to 1, in the
pool; business meetings of brief dur-
ation will precede the swimming ses-
sion.

“It is planned to have two social
meetings a quarter, each one to be
featured with an address by some
person prominent in the swimming
world, in addition to the meets and
exhibits regularly fostered by Tar-
pon,” said Harriet Ray, president of
the organization.

“Initiation of new members occurs
once each quarter and we urge ev-
ery girl who wishes to join to try
out as soon as possible,” continued
Miss Ray.

COLLEGES HONOR

MEMORY OF CAMP

AT GRID GAMES

“Walter Camp Day” To Be
Observed Throughout

Country

With the reopening of college class
rooms throughout the country and the
familiar dull thud of shoe leather
against pig-skin heard on a thousand
athletic fields, comes the announce-
ment from the Walter Camp Memor-
ial Committee that “Walter Camp
Day” is to be celebrated in every sec-
tion of the country as a signal mark
of respect to the memory of the man
who did so much to make foot-ball the
pre-eminent American college game.
Out of deference to the wishes of ath-
letic councils in various sections no
one day has been set aside by the
committee for general observance, but
each community has- been allowed to
designate its own date for the mem-
orial.

Special Games

In scores of college communities
there are to be special Walter Camp
Day games. Some of those already
arranged are:

Oct. 16th—New York University vs.
Tulane.

'Oct. 23rd—Harvard vs. Dartmouth.

Oct. 30th—Columbia vs. Cornell.

Nov. 2nd—N. Y. City College vs.
Manhattan College.'

Nov. 13th—Syracuse vs. Colgate.

Nov. 20th—Eordham vs. George-
town.

Nov. 25th—Pittsburgh vs. Penn
State.

Nov. 25th—Nebraska vs. Washing-
ton.

Erect Monument

The observance of Walter Camp
Day is a part of the plan whereby
the colleges and universities of the
entire nation are uniting under the au-
spices of the National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association why the alumni of
Yale to raise a fund of $300,000 for
the erection of a monumental Walter
Camp Memorial Gateway as an en-
trance to the Yale Bowl and other
athletic fields at New Haven. On eith-
er side of the huge gateway will be
great bronze panels on which will be
cut the names of every college and
university contributing to the fund.

Much Comment On
No Excursion Rule

%	_____

As a result of the edict of Vice-
president Frederick C. Woodward
and Dean Chauncey S. Boucher
that no student excursions to foot
ball games will be sponsored by
the University of Chicago this
year much editorial comment has
been made by “Big Ten” and oth-
er collegiate student publications.

E. T. Nicholson, director 'of stu-
dent affairs at the University of
Minnesota is quoted by the “Ohio
State Lantern” as saying:

“There is no reason whatsoever
for the University of Chicago of-
ficials taking such absurd action
as banning co-educational foot-
ball trips. They are merely taking
the word of a distorted former
student of the University of Illi-
nois who is prejudiced and is over-
whelmed with a desire of ped-
dling rumor and hearsay.”

PURDUE PASSES

SHOW STRENGTH

Boilermakers Real Threat
To Stagg

Without disparaging in any fashion
the Saturday performances of any of
the Big Ten members, it can be said
that the high scores run up by most of
them are meaningless when the caliber
of their opponents is taken into con-
sideration.

Only one team displayed a threat to
Maroon hopes. That was Purdue in
their tough battle with the Navy. As
was expected, Phelan’s lightweights
displayed a clever passing game which
bodes ill for the Maroons after the
rather ragged defense the Staggmen
exhibited against Florida’s passes Sat-
urday. Chicago meets the Boilermak-
ers the 23rd of this month, and by that
time Stagg will have polished off some
of the rough edges of the Maroons’
defense against aerial attacks.

Although the Conference teams’ op-
ponents this Saturday are somewhat
more dangerous than last week’s, a
victory can be chalked up for each of
the Big Ten machines right now, with
but one possible exception. Notre
Dame’s “Fighting Irish” invade the
lair of the Gophers Saturday and a
battle royal is sure to result.

TRICKY YEARLING MACHINE MAKES
PROGRESS WITH PENN FORMATIONS

IN MUDDY SCRIMMAGE SESSION

Stagg Continues To Drive Line In Preparation For Powerful
Maryland Outfit; Easterners Boast

Five Veterans

By Victor Roterus

There is a lot to this game of foot-
ball. No one realizes this better than
A. A. Stagg’s Maroons who have been
on the receiving end of a barrage of
lessons for the past few weeks, and
who were required to master quite
an additional chunk of pedagogy last
night when the coaches had them snap
and skip through an exhaustive prac-
tice conducted in slicker-weather.

As a result of Stagg’s intentions
to devote most of the week to drilling
the linemen in the finer passes of the
sport, this particular section of the
squad was in for it again last night.
They got it going and coming. They
were placed on the defense against the
crack freshman team most of the time
but they also came in for offensive
drill when the second string varsity
backs were given an opportunity to
transport the muddy footballs.

Use Penn Plays

The freshman, tutored by Fritz Cris-1
ler, used Pennsylvania plays exclusive-
ly in their attack. As this Saturday’s
opponent will be Maryland, and Penn-
sylvania will not be played for another
week, this was a surprise to some Ma-
roon followers. However, the Penn
game is the more important, and as
Penn and Maryland both employ sim-
ilar methods of attack; the coaches
probably believe that defensive work
spent on the offensive tactics of one
team will give the men sufficient
knowledge of the other.

The freshman team’s execution of
the plays was fairly effective consid-
ering the slippery ground and the wet
ball. Everything was tried and all of
it bordered on the tricky, now-you-
see-it-now-you-don’t sort of stuff
which is charatceristic of eastern foot-
ball. . Criss-crosses capped by either a
line plunge, end run or pass, and dif-
ferent varieties of fakes abounded. The
freshman were smeared for losses
many a time but a number of the
plays were completed for gains. The
varsity backs formed the secondary

defense and they were chiefly concern-
ed with the passing. Mendenhall, Ter-
re Haute flash, did some commendable
heaving for the yearlings. He is a
cool, finished player.

Drives Line

Every lineman was shoved into ac-
tive duty and though they charged in
fine style some of the tackling was
faulty. After a time Stagg took the
first string backs aside and gave them
theoretical offensive practice.

The Maryland team possesses more
poundage than the Maroons but Camp-
bell Dickson who scouted them last
week said that the Maryland players
ewre not in condition when they play-
ed South Carolina. Five of the east-
erners played regularly last fall. They
are Adams, end; Zulick, tackle; Baf-
ford, center; Linkous, fullback, and
Capt. Stevens, halfback. Boyd, quar-
ter, and Leatherman, tackle, played a
good share of last season. Pugh, a
newcomer, has proved himself to be
one of the Old Liner’s best backs. He
is a drop-kicker of unusual ability. All
the Maryland backs are adept passers
and ballhandlers and this is essential
to the success of the Warner type of
attack which Maryland uses.

As Stagg seems to have also made
open playing a vjtal part of his team’s
equipment there should be a very
modern football game played here next
Saturday. ,
