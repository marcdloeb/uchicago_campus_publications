Five of the most prominent athletes I (meet Application for the use of

on campus have been selected by
Burt McKinney, head of the Rush-
ing division of the Interscholastic
track commission, to form a high-
powered rushing organization to rush
the star athletes who are doubtful as
to their plans for higher learning for
Chicago.

It is hoped that this announcement
of change in date will not affect those
who have planned to attend the per-

ernity functions have been planned
for June. 4, the new date seems to
be more favorable, according to

his

cross section view of how the struc-
ture will work.

The corresponding rushing com-
mittee, under the leadership of Jack
Cusack, was the first group to come
into contact with the leading athletes.
Through them, the records of the
various men were secured. The re-
ception committee, under John Ger-
hart then comes into the field and
finds out the time at which each
athlete or group of athletes will ar-
rive in Chicago and makes arrange-
ments for them to be met by either
a member of the reception commit-
tee, or by the fraternity representa-
tive from the house where the boys
will stay on their visit here.

The first day will be taken up by
registration and the fraternity en-

inaries will take place and the cam-

leadership of Wilfred Heitmann will
start functioning. Each place win-
ner will have a member of this com-
mittee assigned as a companion for
the rest of the day. The place win-

week will work in cooperation with
the Campus rushing committee in this
program.

Saturday night the Senior Vaude-

will be invited to attend this. Re-

NAME TAGGERS’
FJR PREP MEET

This question, provoked by the
story of the white-haired Samaritan’s
destitution and loneliness in the
County Hospital, was answered today
by Tom’s oldest University friend—
the Old Man. The fact that the
“dean of all trainers” lies dying in
the County hospital, a ward of the
public, has been interpreted as an
indication of the University’s in-
gratitude and from every corner of
the campus have come cries of pro-
test.

“Tom Eek came to me eleven years
ago,” Mr. Stagg relates, “he was
fifty-nine years old—and fifty-nine
is pretty late in life for any man
to start. I liked Tom—as everybody
liked him. He was a fatherly sort
of chap, and he told me that he
wanted to learn something about the
track game. So I hired him as a
rubber.

George Downing, ’25, now taking
graduate work at the University, has
been appointed an instructor in the
Art department for the Autumn
quarters of 1926 and 1927. He will
offer a course in Italian Renaissance
Painting and will assist Prof. Wal-
ter Sargent, head of the department

with his Advanced Drawing
Painting course.

Downing was recently awarded
of the Carnegie scholarships
art which allows him to spend

and

one
in

one

year to further his study in art at
any American university. He will
leave for Harvard at the end of the
Autumn quarter for one-half year.
In the winter of 1927, after having
taught at the University for a sec-
ond Autumn quarter he will return
to Harvard to complete his year.

Downing is a member of Phi Gam-
ma Delta and is also a Phi Beta Kap-
pa.

Practically Penniless

“At that time Tom was practically
penniless. He had had some appre-
ciable sums of money during his life
as a trainer and athlete, but it had
all drifted away.”

“As to Tom’s being destitute—
that’s very likely. And it’s no one’s
fault. The man was too old to hold
an important position, and conse-
quently couldn’t receive an import-
ant man’s pay. Always giving his
money away, making loans that were
never repaid, his living expenses ex-
ceeded his income. But for six
months, while Tom has been in pret-
ty bad shape, his salary has gone
on—and he is still being paid.

GREY RETURNS
AS INSTRUCTOR

Graduate of ’23 to Teach in
English Department

Lennox B. Grey, class of ’23 is
returning to the University to teach
in the English department. Mr.
Grey at present is head-master in a
boy’s academy in Florida. He went
to the academy from the English
staff of the University of Minnesota.

It was through his efforts that the
Circle was originated, and he was
the first editor of that publication.
He was head Marshal in his senior
year, a member of Owl and Serpent
and a member of Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity.

Cupid Plies Trade Busily; Two

More Couples Set Wedding Date

In the spring when a young man’s
fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
love, one expects a flood of wed-
ding invitations and engagement an-
nouncements. And this year as
ever.

Last week the campus was com-
menting on the engagements of El-
len MacCracken to Hugh Wilson and
of Catherine Campbell to Sam Hib-
ben. Then there was the much dis-
cussed marriage of Betty Emerson
and Fred Law in the Thorndike Hil-
ton Memorial chapel.

And this week brings the an-
nouncements of two more couples
from among the University alumni.
On the second of June the wedding
of Miss Florence Holman to Donald
M. Lockett will take place at the
South Shore Country club.

Miss Holman was a member of

Chi Rho Sigma club, president of the
Federation of University women, and
president of the inter-club council.
Miss Holman was a member of the
class of 1925. Mr. Lockett was a
member of Psi Upsilon fraternity,
chairman of the dramatic association,
member of Owl and Serpent, and a
member of Blackfriars.

The other wedding announcement
is that of Miss Charlotte Montgom-
ery to Lennox B. Grey. They are
to be married on June 11 at the
Church of the Redeemers in the city.
Miss Montgomery was a member of
Sigma club when she was in school.
Mr. Grey was a member of Phi Gam-
ma Delta fraternity. He was also
head marshall and a member of the
Maroon staff. He will return to
the University next year to teach in
the English department.

Two hundred couples and Charles
Dornberger’s Victor Recording Or-

terclass Hop tonight at 9 o’clock in
Ida Noyes gym. The Grand March,
set for 10, will see Graham Hagey

Graham the juniors, John McDon-
ough and Betsy Farwell the sopho-
j mores, and Harry Hagey and Char-

After the March, dancing will con-
tinue until 2 in the flower-decked
hall. Smilax and cherry blossoms
will be used as the floral decora-
tions, while the color scheme of the
whole thing will center on orchid
and pink. A Japanese garden effect
is being aimed at, and Chairman John
McDonough of decorations has state-
ed that no less than two hundred lan-
terns, a latticework cage for the or-
chestra, parasols, and festoons are
being thrown into the business to-
wards that end.

Dornberger Plays

Dornberger’s band is a rather
noted ensemble, having played at
the Congress before the Coon-Sand-
ers outfit and established a decided
reputation there. The band is just
returning from the east, where it
’ played at the Roseland Ballroom,
New York. Charles and his men are
expected to prove a strong counter-

Saturday evening dances will be
held at Ida Noyes hall under the
auspices of the University of Chi-
cago Settlement League during the
summer quarter. The first of these
dances will be held on June 26 and
the last one will be held on August

28. Last summer the League spon-
sored a series of dances which proved
to be very successful, and it hopes
to make the ones this summer just
as popular, according to Mrs. Wil-
bur Beauchamp, dance chairman.

Admission to the floor will be 50
cents a person, or one dollar a cou-
ple. Punch will be served by the
Y. W. C. A. at five cents a glass to
the dancers. Any profits made in
the course of the summer will be
turned over to the League. “We
hope to add to the enjoyment of the
students by offering entertainment
at such a reasonable price and in
such a convenient place, and inci-
dentally to help the League,” said
Mirs. Beauchamp. Further arrange-
ments for the dances will be under
the direction of May Hess, dance
manager, and will be announced in
a later issue of The Daily Maroon.

officers and all
various commit-

tees of Y. W. C. A. The officers are
Kathleen Stewart, (president; Allis
Graham, vice-president; Miriam Wal-
ker, secretary; and Amy Bradshaw,
treasurer.

This will be the second time that
the first cabinet has been together
in a social gathering, the first being
a week-end party at Riverside in the
first part of May. The women in
the cabinet will furnish the amuse-
ments for the meeting, according to
Roberta Cannell, chairman of World
Fellowship Committee.

English 140 is no more.

Its place in the curriculum of the
University has been usurped by three
new courses, officially known as Eng-
lish 130, 131, and 132—introduc-
tions to the Study of Poetry, Drama
and Fiction.

English 140, as defined by the
departmental bulletin, was “a his-
torical study of texts, intended to
define the characteristics of the lit-
erary periods and of the standard
forms.” Its successors, as is to be
expected in view of their youth, are
inclined to slight the historical phase
of their subjects and to 'draw much
of their material from contemporary
writings.

English 130 will consider the na-
ture of poetry, the psychology of the
poet, and will require representative
collateral reading, according to Mrs.
Edith Foster Flint.

TED BLOOMBERG, ’25
VICTIM OF NEPHRITIS

BEG YOUR PARDON

The name of the architect who de-
signed the new University chapel
was yesterday given incorrectly. The
architect who designed the chapel,
working for several years in con-
junction with President Burton, was
Bertram G. Goodhue.

Mr. Goodhue, who is known as one
of the best, and one of the most fa,r-
seeing architects of the present day,
planned the chapel after several yedrs
of research work abroad.

Theodore R. Bloomberg, Law, ’28,
died of nephritis early Wednesday
morning at his home in Charleston,
West Virginia.

During the Winter quarter, Mr.
Bloomberg was forced to leave school
because of illness. He was in the
hospital for several months suffer-
ing from kidney trouble. After par-
tially recovering he returned to his
home in Charleston. His condition
seemed favorable, according to his
physician, and he was planning to re-
turn to the University next year.
Another attack, however, removed his
chance of recovery.

Bloomberg received his Ph. B. in
1925 and immediately entered the
Law school. He was a member of
Pi Lambda Phi fraternity and dur-
ing his Junior year was associate
editor of the Cap and Gown.

of the building are being decorated
along the same lines as prevail on
the floor itself, and subdued lighting
is expected to greatly enhance the
Japanese atmosphere of the dcora-
tions.

More Dance Space

The numbers of dancers this year
will be smaller than at any previous
Hop, for it was decided by the lead-
ers to limit the number of couples
this year to prevent a crowded floor.
Last year three hundred couples
were ready for the Hop when the
death of President Burton occurred
to end the affair, and it was felt by
this year year’s leaders that a reputi-
tion of such a-sale would make danc-
ing conditions uncomfortable.

The favor of the evening will be
a special Hop publication, masked
under a trick name conceived onb
after considerable time and expendi-
ture of energy by the editors of the

There’s no getting around it. The College Man and the fur
coat are the happy combination—one that is very hard it beat.

REGISTRATION for next year has already started. A word of
•• advice, then, is not untimely—“Choose wisely.”

The number of students who register with regard to the clock
rather than with regard to their own educational benefits is stupend-
ous. Too many register for courses for which a friend has registered,
and only in order to be entertained by the friend rather than to be
enlightened by the instruction of the professor And not a few stu-
dents endeavor to register for “snap” or “pipe" courses.

The student who registers for a course merely because the
time is convenient is indirectly defeating his own ultimate purpose
—the pursuit of knowledge. Amusing friends may become boring;
they inevitably do. “Snap" courses are rarely as easy as they are
reputed to be, and in most cases they are the least interesting courses

What’s better to wear at a football

game than a fur coat? What’s better to
swagger across an icy campus than a real keen raccoon or
dogskin coat? You may know the answer—we don’t.



INTEREST in the classics is on the rise or decline. Opinions are j
well divided on the subject. Those who are vitally interested j
in the classics departments feel that students are displaying a great- i
er realization of their value, while those not interested in the sub- :
ject go about all unconscious of the languages and literatures of the I



Some indication of their appeal to the public may be found
in the productions of the Moscow Art theater. “Carmencita and the
soldiers,” the Russians’ version of the Merimee story was presented
fifteen times; “Lysistrata” Aristophanes' comedy, only three times. I
Both of these productions were quite “all Russians’ to the audiences,
but an evident attempt was made to stage them in the proper spirit.
The audiences attending the “Lysistrata” appeared to enjoy and un-
derstand it as well as the “Carmencita.” But, it is left to conjee- i
ture to determine how successful a longer run of the Greek comedy |
would be.

The beauty of it is, there is nothing
to prevent you from getting a fur coat
for next winter. We have devised a part payment plan known
as “The Davis Fur Coat Thrift Club.” You may make your
selection now, pay a small deposit and small weekly payments
and your fur coat will be paid for and ready for you in
November. A credit will be allowed from the purchase price
if payments are made according to schedule. Your coat will
be kept without charge in our cold, dry-air storage vaults un-
til November.

into his room at break of day. There
he lay, his eyes wide open, his

SINGLES TOURNEY

Hudlin and Hall Survive
Doubles; Favorites
In Lead

By Tom Stephenson

Thanks to Chicago’s daylight-sav-
ing system, not a bit of time was
lost to the Tennis World yesterday,
for here on the Midway the day just
overflowed with the best of Tennis.
Starting at 10 o’clock in the morning
and continuing until dusk, Big Ten
net stars assembled here for the
1926 Conference Championship
Tournament, got well under way,
playing no less than thirty-five
matches, and reaching the fourth
round of the'singles competition play.

Those surviving yesterday’s singles
eliminations are O’Connell, Illinois;
Durand, Wisconsin; Gelwick, Illinois;
Shapinsky, Chicago; Sherrill, North-
western; Krickbaum, Michigan;
Shoaff, Illinois; Shay, Minnesota;
Boldenweck, Wisconsin and Vose of
Michigan. The last four of these
men have not yet played their fourth
round, and will meet this morning at
10 o’clock.

Important Matches Today

Other matches at 10 o’clock will
be Shapinsky, Krickbaum, O’Connell,
Durand, and Gelwick, Shen-ill.
Winners of the matches will go into
the semi-finals. The Shapinsky,
Krickbaum battle is the feature
match. Krickbaum is a big favorite
to cop first honors this year, having
reached the semi-finals last year, but
will have a game on his hands this
morning against Shapinsky, sole Ma-
roon survivor, and a dangerous dark
horse in the tourney.

Krickbaum is rivalled by O’Connell
of Illinois as a pre-tourney favorite.
These two men were the class o’
yesterday’s play, but only a few sto
ahead of Shay, Minnesota, and Du-
rand and Boldenweck of Wisconsin.,
Illinois, with three men, and Wiscon-

TRACK AND BALL TEAMS COMPETE .
TOMORROW AT IOWA AND O. STATE

Tomorrow wiM see both the track
and baseball teams in action away
from home. The track men left last
night for the wide expanses of Iowa.
Preliminaries will be run off today
and finals are scheduled for tomor-
row. While the track men. are busy
digging their shoes in Iowan turf,
the ball tossers will be competing
against Ohio State.

Ohio State is leading the Confer-
ence basebailers in batting, and
places third at present. They have
a powerful and consistent machine.
Captain Sloteman is fast on delivery
and is backed by Captain Karrow of
the football- squad and Tarbert last
year’s Basketball captain. The great
majority of Ohio’s hitters are left
handers, thus making it easier for
Captain Gubbins at the mound.

Gubbin’s men are scheduled for a
winning streak and it might just as
well begin Saturday as any other
time. The men have been playing
a good game but needed fortune’s

Goodman Slap* Way
To Handball Tide

In a gruelling match that was
muchcloser than the score indi-
cates, Irving Goodman, represent-
ing the Macs, won the University
handball championship by defeat-
ing Alex Elson, also of the Macs,
21-10, 21-8 yesterday afternoon.
Goodman, who is coholder of the
doubles title, obtained an early
lead in both games and was never
headed. The players engaged in
many fierce volleying duels and
displayed by far the best hand-
ball of the tournament.

In the playoff for third place,
Geisman defeated Silverman in a
ni pand tuck battle all the way,
18-21, 21-9, 21-20. This popular
sport which was carried over from
the winter quarter, is now com-
pleted.

WHAT of IT?

a^eoage mokcpwts^

That awful period of the year
when one looks forward to the long
summer vacation months, feeling
meanwhile one’s pockets, has come.
It seems imperative, in my own par-
ticular case, that work is in order—
hard, greulling, numbing work, as
Horatio Alger so aply terms it—
work of some sort or other. Work,
indeed, of any sort that’ll let me
lay by a little for the rainy day when
college tuition comes due next fall.

It is a favorite occupation of mine
at these times to mull over this sum-
mer work problem, to speculate upon
it, to paw it about as a cat would his
mouse. I make no bones, as the sim-
ple folk say in their pungent idiom,
in admitting that I am looking for
an easy graft. But, of course, there
is the usual hitch in my plans of easy
grafts being few and far between,
and other pseudo-slickers also on the
lookout for them many and alert as
hounds sharpened on a diet of mus-
tard.

hand to give them a push. Perhaps
the good dame will feel that she has
done the squad enough harm and
lend them a helping hand this com-
ing game, since their playing has been
beyond reproach.

The men on the field and on the
cinder trails will be battling for su-
premacy at the Conference meet.
Michigan, Illinois, Ohio State am
Wisconsin will be struggling for first
place while the remaining teams will
do their utmost to trail the placers.
Chicago has a fine chance of taking-
several firsts and fighting for lead?
in other events.

Burg, after showing his stuff at Il-
linois and Indoor Track Conference
meets, is scheduled for a win in the

is being counted upon for a win or

Ann Arbor Men

Next Victims of

Maroon Golfers

By Gen Florez

Maroon golfers are leaving en-
route to take home a possible fifth
consecutive victory by defeating the
state golf team on the Wolverine
course. Four foursomes are to be
played, two in the morning and the
same number in the afternoon. Chi-
cago is the only team that has as
yet been undefeated and although the
course they are to play is said to bt
very short and tricky the local men
have the best of chances to capture
another win.

Michigan succumbed to the Orange
and Blue golfers last week by the
close score of 11 1-2 to 12 1-2, while
the victors were easily vanquished
by the Maroons to the tune of 16
to 5. If former players count, then
the locals can be expected to repeat
their former performances.

Patterson and Heisert will pair up,
leaving Dorsey and Bartlett to play
the other duet role. Fred Feeley,
Conner, Glover and probably I^h-
man will swing the clubs for Mich-
igan. All four men are of first rate
caliber and are expected to give
Heisert’s men a tough battle.

The golf team is apparently up-
holding lone honors for the campus,
since the men have never been de-
feated and are expected to come
through in fine shape. Their practices
of the past week have made them
yet more powerful and chances are
will come through with a clean slate.

PLAN FANCY DRESS
PARADE FOR ANNUAL
WOMEN’S FIELD DAY

A fancy dress parade by the volley
ball and field and track teams will
be the initial event in the annual
Women’s Field day which will be
held Tuesday, June 8, at 3:45 on
Dudley Field.

The parade which is customarily
held to introduce the Field day pro-
gram was not held last year on ac-
count of the death of President Bur-
ton.

Following the parade which will
circle Dudley Field accompanied by
the University band, the events will
be held. They will consist of hur-
dles, races, javelin and discus throw-
ing, broad jumping and champion-
ship volley ball games.

The archery tournament which is
a part of the regular Field day pro-
gram will be held on Monday, June
7, as the sport will require the entire
field. All women enrolled jn Physi-
cal Culture classes will participate in
the Field day program on that day.

GRIDMEN BREAK UP
DRILL FOR SEASON

Maroon gridmen ran through their
final practice session last Wednesday
afternoon before breaking up train-
ing for the season. Coach Stagg
watched the final signal drill from
an ariel vantage point and seemed
rather pleased with the work of the
squad.

The football men now rest until
time for practice for the opening
game with Florida next autumn,
which begins with the first days be-
i fore the opening of school.

FINAL EVENTS OF
ATHLETIC REVUE

RUN OFF TODAY

<	——————

Several Record* Broken
In Races of

the Day

Records smashed, a number of up-
sets in dope, the large number of
entries in the preliminaries but most
o fall the efficiency of the committees
were the outstanding features of the
first round of the Spring Intramural
Carnival yesterday afternoon.

Chuck Anderson and Jerry Quin,
brothers in Alpha Delta Phi were
the record breakers. The versatile
Chuck entered the 100 and 50 yard
dashes—ran like a deer in both and
emerged with two records— 10 2-5
in the hundred and 5 7-10 in the fif-
ty. Quin broke his record in the
broad jump when he sailed over the
take off board with a leap of 20 feet
3 inches. AH of which are marks
that would place well upin any var-
sity competition.

Many Thrills

The hurdles as usual provided the
thrills of the afternoon. Spills were
frequent and completely upset the
dope in addition to upsetting the run-
ners. The second heat was especial-
ly mixed up. Peale, one of the fav-
orites, fell at the second hurdle but
got up again and was running in
fifth place when Stem running in
third place and an easy qualifier fell
on the last hurdle, bringing Peale up
to a qualifying place.

The way Bill Weddell, Spring
Festival manager, and his well chos-
en staff managed the events was
nothing short of near perfection. Ev-
ery event was run o ffon time and'
not a murmur of dissatisfaction was
heard from any of the contestants.
If the efficiency of the staff remains
the same today is it was yesterday
the finals will be perfect in their
ordei at least.

Alpha Delt Leads

Alpha Delta Phi leads the list of
fraternity qualifiers with seven men
ready to run this afternoon in the
finals. The Phi Psi’s are next with
five qualified and the rest of the or-
ganizations are about even.

The complete list of qualifiers is
as follows:

120 yard low hurdles; 1st heat—
Francis, Alpha Delt, first; Griffin,
Delta Sig, second; Moskowitz, Macs
third; Helfrich, unattached fourth;
time, 17.

2nd heat—Budfong, D. U., first;
Wilcox, S. A. E. second; Norberg,
Lambda Chi Alpha, third; peale, Phi
Psi fourth; time, 15.

50 yard dash—1st heat—Wilcox,
S. A. E., McEwen, Alpha Delt, sec-
ond; Gaskill, Delta Sig, third; time,

4th Platoon Wins

Pushball Contest

The Fourth Platoon of the M.

P. C. riding classes won a semi-
final pushball contest from the
Third Platoon yesterday after-
noon, by a score of 4 to 0. The
captain of the winning team was
Cadet Second Lieutenant G. N.
Bench, with Cadet First Lieuten-
ant C. W. Lenth as captain of the
losers.

A final game will be played be-
tween the winners of the morning
sections and the afternoon sections
at an early date. The winner of
the morning semi-finals was the .
second platoon, captained by Cad-
et Second Lieutenant E. Mattick.
There is much interest aroused in
the M. S. Department over the
outcome of the coming match.

WATER POLOISTS

QUITJRACT1CE

Look to Strong Team for
Next Season

Coach MacGillivray’s water polo
men will a^band until fall this week.
No longer will students be turned
away from the tank doors on Tues-
day and Thursday afternoons. Both
the coach and captain elect Hall
think that a fairly strong nucleus has
been developed for next -season’s
workouts and with a great number
of veterans to rely on for future
play, the water men are no longer to
gather on the two afternoons men-
tioned.	’

With the exception of last sea-
son’s captain, P. Petrolowitz who
graduates this quarter, all the men
will be back next fall for competi-
tion. Krogh, Jelinek, Gordon,
White, Feris, Howe and Oker are a
few of the men who according to
Coach will take part in future
battles.

Cornelius Oker, freshman swim
team captain, has developed into a
player of true worth in water polo
play.

Kappa Nu machine. Bus Stevens’
great pitching ability will go a long
way in determining this afternoon’s
results. He pitched a no nit, no run.
game last year in the semi-fianls and
will try to repeat the performance.

Klaff is also a sphere tosser of
fame and has the advantage of pitch-
ing with an air tight infield to back
him. So far neither one of the two
teams have had the change to really
exhibit their playirg ab I t- .m -^
the games having t ^en nV y I cl ►
in or immediately fit'” • v n ■' ’ i
an extremely bumpy and rough fie.J.
With the smooth turf of Stagg Field
beneat their feet and a fast path
between the bases, both Sigma Nu
and Kappa Nu players have an excel-
lent chance to excel their former-
game performances.

A large gold trophy o fbaseball
and crossed bats will be awarded to
the winning nine and individual med-
alettes will be given to each player.

Sigma Nu ball men will face the
Kappa Nu nine at Stagg Field this
afternoon at 4 in what promises to
be one of the most interesting and
closely contested affairs of this sea-
son. Kappa Nu has reached the
semifinals three years in succession
and Sigma Nu has captured the cam-
pus championship the last two sea-
sons.

Stevens pitched a fine game in the
semifinals Wednesday when he elim-
inated the Alpha Delt outfit by a 5
to 3 count. Klaff held out for four-
teen innings against the Delta Sig-
ma Phi batters and finally won the
game by the close score of 4 to 3.
Against the Senators the Kappa Nu
men also showed high caliber in
ending the fray by doubling the four
runs that the Senators brought home.

Bus Stevens, Harold, Koerber and
Windman are the outstandm* ■

i tense, while Klatt, Stone, Kutner and

GYM CHAMPIONS
PRESENTED WITH

MAJOR LETTERS

Two Trackmen, Four Ball
Men, Two Swimmers

On List

Although the final list of “C”
winners will not be made public un-
til after the season has been com-
pleted Coach Stagg announced a par-
tial list yesterday which includes the
names of the athletes to be honored
with a major letter for the first
time.

Burg On List

The list of the men who have been
awarded their letter for the first
time is: Track—Anton Burg, L. T.
Beall; Baseball—A. B. McConnell,
J. R. Webster, Claude Brignall, Wil-
liam Macklind; swimming—Charles
Lane; Waterpclo—John Petrolowitz;
gymnastics—James Conner, Ray-
mond Nelson, Floyd Davidson, James
Flexner; wrestling—George Graham,
Kaare Krogh.

Burg is one of the most outstand-
ing of these men. He broke into
prominence on the track team with
a bang. Although he showed but lit-
tle possibility of being a strong track
man last year, but he perfected his
form in the high jump so that he
was able to clear the bar at 6 feet
6 inches at Columbus. He is going
after a record in the Conference
track meet which is being held to-
day and tomorrow at Iowa City.

Gymnast* Win Title

The gymnasts all combined to win
the Intercollegiate title at Philadel-
jphia, after winning the Big Ten
championship at Purdue. Graham
was captain of the wrestling team
while Krogh won the Conference 175
pound title. Petrolewitz was the
star and captain of the water polo
team. Brignail’s heavy hitting has
placed him with the conference
swat-leaders with an average around
the .400 mark. He is rated one of
the best third basemen in the Big
Ten.
