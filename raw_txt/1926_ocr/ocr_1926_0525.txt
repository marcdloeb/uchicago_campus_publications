California Board Prohibits
Athletes from Entering

Interscholastic

California athletes will not compete
in the World’s Greatest Interscholas-
tic to be held on Soldiers’ Field June 4
and 5. Such was the import of a let-
ter received yesterday by the Inter-
scholastic commission from the presi
dent of the student body at Compton
high school, Compton. California.

The California Interscholastic Fed-
eration passed a new ruling recently
that forbids athletes to leave the state
to compete in track meets, and this
has caused an uproar in the Golden
state schools.

Compton Already Entered

Entries were already in from the
Compton school, money had been
raised from the business men of the
town to defray the expenses of the
prep school stars, and whole-hearted
support received from the coaches and
faculty of the school, when the bad
news was received.

The school in California that will
be hit the hardest is without doubt
San Bernardino high. Jimmy Payne,
holder of the World's Lnterscholastic
record in the 220 low hurdles with a
time of 23.8. has forfeited his chatice
of copping national honors through
the inopportune interference of the
Federation. His entry blank was also
in the hands of the commission, along
with that of several of his team mates.

Plea Via Air Mail

The letter arrived yesterday by air
mail and contained an urgent pica to
Coach Stagg, to use his influence and
have the Federation withdraw its rul-
ing. Since the receipt of the epistle.
Mr. Stagg has done his best tc have
the seemingly unfair rule removed,
but the boards seems to be obdurate,
and stubbornly sticks to its decision.

Without doubt, this ruling is a se-
vere blow to the athletes of California.
Their records in track and field events
are far above the average of the other
parts of the country, and their chances
of finishing high in the National meet
were great.

Many Entries Vetoed

All of the promising track men had
either sent for information concerning
the World’s Greatest Interscholastic,

Gerald Karr Smith, after seven
years’ service as Executive Secretary
of the University Y. M. C. A., has
announced his resignation, to take ef-
fect July 1, at which time he will take
the position of Director of Programs
at the Y. M. C. A. hotel.

Although Mr. Smith requested that
the reasons for his action not be pub-
lished, he issued the following state-
ment: “When I leave it will be with
the hope that I have helped to lay a
secure enough foundation that the As-
sociation may continue to grow on the
campus of the University, and become
an important cooperating factor in
student movements.”

Mr. Smith, known familiarly to the
students of the University as “Jerry”,
was born in Galion, Ohio, in 1882.
His early youth was spent in Belle-
"ontain, Ohio. He entered Ohio Wes-
leyan College, in 1900 from which he
was graduated with an A. B. degree
in 1904. His college activities were
largely in Y. M. C. A., although he
sang for a time in the Varsity quartet.
He is a member of Sigma Alpha Ep-

DISCUSS SYSTEM OF
CLOSED GRADING AT
FEDERATION TONIGHT

Is the closed system of grading su-
perior to the present method of pub-
lishing grades? Are grades an import-
ant-reason for cheating? These ques-
tions will be discussed in detail at the
Federation meeting tonight from 7 to
8 in the library of Ida Noyes hall.
Because almost all the women present
voted in favor of closed grading at a
referendum taken at the last council
meeting it was decided to bring the
question up for discussion by the
complete group.

This subject also includes the points
of whether or not grades play too im-
portant a part in a student’s attitude
towards his college career and if they
hinder rather than help his scholarship.
Several members of the faculty have
been asked t ' attend the meeting in
order to find a real solution of the
problem. According to Hannah John-
son, chairmen of the organization, it
is expected that this discussion will
be even more valuable than the usually
helpful Federation discussions.

Hold Finals Of

Final readings for the Milo P. Jew-
ett contest for the best reading of a
selection from the Bible, will be held
this afternoon at 4:30 in Theology j
106. A prize of fifty dollars will be
given to the winner. The contest is
an annual affair and is limited to third
year students in the Divinity school.

Following the preliminaries held last
week, four men are still competing
for the prize. They are R. F. Judson,
P. J. Rutledge, S. H. Markowitz and
W. E. Daniels. Dr. Theodore Soares,
head of the department of Practical
Theology of the Divinity school will
preside at the contest.

Selections will be of two types: nar-
rative, including Old Testament stories
or New Testament parables, lyrical
readings such as the Psalms. The time
limit is ten minutes for both selections.

Judges for the contest are Miss
Georgie L. Chamberlain, head of the
Institute of Sacred Literature: Mr.
Frank H. O’Hara of the English de-
partment; and the Rev. Von Ogden
Vogt, pastor of the First Unitarian
church.

Boucher Makes Statement

“Probably no one could really fill
the vacancy caused by the resignation
of Dean Wilkin,” said Dean Bouch-
er. “I certainly have no delusions on
that score. Since President Mason
and Vice-President Woodward think
I can serve the University best dur-
ing the coming year as Dean of the
Colleges, it would be poor sports-
manship on my part not to make the
effort. I am thoroughly convinced
that the University will make great
strides forward in the near future un-
der the leadership of Mr. Mason and
Mr. Woodward.”

Dean Boucher, a member of Theta
Delta Chi, the fraternity which re-
fused to establish a chapter at Chi-
cago on the grounds that a large city
was no place for fraternities, has been
in the office which controls fraternities
and other campus activities here since
the Spring quarter of 1926, and by
their own judgment has dealt with
them fairly and squarely.

Sound Experience

Although a young man, Mr. Bouch-
er came here in 1923 with a wide and
sound experience in both his academic
work, American History, and in cam-
pus problems. Work in five Univer-
sities, in widely separated parts of
the country, had enabled him to gain
a comprehensive viewpoint on the un-

KEEPING COLLEGE ALIVE

COLLEGE is not what it used to be. The world, and man, and
v man s knowledge of the world, have all changed fast in the
last thirty years; and college has changed with them. For the college
is not a mill that grinds out so many finished grads each June. It is
alive; it is a group of personalities, a great composite mind. It must
not only teach; it must learn. When the scientists discover new facts
and the philosophers discover new ways of looking at those facts,
and the rest of the world in turn adopts new habits of living, the
college can not continue its old routine.

Dean Ernest Hatch Wilkins has studied and known the needs
of the colleges in the twentieth century. He has commenced the job
of answering many of those needs. He has had a share in the es-
tablishment of Orientation Courses (reflective thinking, the nature
of the world and of man, etc.) to guide students through the ever

more intricate maze of life and learning; in the
dent according to their ability, so that each will
teaching and the kind of classmates he needs.

Dean Chauncey Samuel Boucher, successor to

grouping of stu-
have the kind of

Mr. Wilkins, has

himself studied the question of. adapting the college to the world.
He has studied it as a leader of undergraduate affairs at Michigan,
as a professor in five universities, and as assistant to Mr. Wilkins.
On the basis of such studies he has taken up the active work where
Mr. Wilkins left it.

He has agreed to give time and energy from his work of re-
search in the coming year to the job of leadership that shall make
and maintain a live college. An able intellect, an alertness to the
spirit of the day, the courage to accept a stupendous job, and a sense
of humor that will help him out of many a dilemma—these qualities
seem to fit Dean Boucher for that leadership.

With such men at the wheel, the colleges of 1926 have a good
chance to keep pace’with the world of 1926.

Long Waited Illini
Ball Tilt Tomorrow

Chicago’s baseball team travels
to Champaign tomorrow to invade
the Illini stronghold for the long
awaited return game. The Maroons
are already credited with one win
over the Indians in the season's
thriller two weeks ago when the
team finally took the victory by a
lone run lead after a fourteen inn-
ing battle.

The Illini are especially anxious
to take a win to wind up their sea-
son which ends when they meet the
Gophers Saturday. Coach Lund-
gren will have five pitchers avail-
able for the game and the rest of
the team is said to be in the very
acme of form. Ten of the Illini
players, members of the senior class
•will play their last games for their
university this week.

St. John’s Enter
Full Team For Meet

Positive assurance was received by
the corresponding rushing committee
from St. John’s Military Academy to
thc effect that it will be represented
by a full team of thirty athletes at the
World's Greatest lnterscholastic.

Taylor, Bradshaw, and Capt. Jimmy
Bradshaw are thc nucleus of the team.
In the Ohio Relays; at Columbus re-
cently Taylor was an easy victor in thc
120 yard high hurdles—running them
in 15:01 setting a new world’s aca-
demic record. Babcock has been a
leading point scorer in all of their
meets this year.

St. Johns, for the three years pre-
ceding last, won the meet three
straight times.

He is best known as a star half
back of the Maroon football team,
playing at that position for the last
three years. He finished his grid ca-
reer in a blaze of glory by spectacular
ground gaining in the last two games.
No one who saw the Dartmouth game
will forget how Kernwein lan the ends
for gain after gain. He continued his
consistent w<^rk in the Wisconsin
game. He did most of the punting
for his team the last two years and
has filled this responsible position with
honor to himself and the Maroons.

Graham has also had a brilliant ca-
reer on the track, but was kept out of
the early season meets this year due
to a serious injury received in foot-
ball which has not completely healed.
In former years he annexed many hon-
ors as a dash man. He was a hiember
of the team which took honors in last
year’s Penn Relays.

His highest honor in social circles
came this year when he was selected
as one of the leaders for the Washing-
ton Prom. He is a member of Sigma
Chi.

Golfmen Defeat

Illinois; Other

Teams Lose Out

The most pleasing thing to report
of the Maroon’s strenuous week-end in
athletics is the victory of the ever re-
liable golf team over Illinois by a
12-2 count. The other things that are
not so pleasing are the baseball team’s
defeat by Purdue 7-5; the track team’s
lost to Minnesota 77-59, and the ten-
nis team’s bow to Wisconsin 4-2.

Purdue managed to gather its hits
when they counted and by taking a
few runs every now and then managed
to stow away a victory. Gubbins was
not very successful against the heavy-
hitting visitors granting them twelve
safe blows. A spirited last inning ral-
