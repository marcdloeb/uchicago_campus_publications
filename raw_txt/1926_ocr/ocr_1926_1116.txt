WHAT OF
IT?

There is nothing much left to do
this week but sit around and wait un-
til next Saturday, when the boys will
have a crack at Wisconsin in their up-
hill battle to win a Conference game.
As an observer of all the games so far.
including the debacle at Evanston
Saturday, I am a little bit puzzled by
Mr. Stagg's team. The performance
Saturday and the admissions of the
players themselves leave no doubt that
the team is well coached. Individual-
ly the men aren’t so bad—not so bad
as they ought to be to be beat by any
score like 38-7. I think it must be in
the attitude of the team. They seem
to lack mutual confidence, that esprit
de corps that a team like Northwest-
ern. weak as it is in spots, is made
by. I should like, just as an experi-
men. to see the team take the field
this Saturday feeling confident for a
change. I should not be surprised,
were they to do this, if something
would happen.

♦ * * ♦

The team did not play like it was
keyed very much at the start of the
game with Northwestern. It went to
pieces for a while after that first un-
enrouraging turn of things, and did
things that it would not ordinarily be
guilty of through all the games of the
season. The team will undoubtedly be
keyed up for Wisconsin. The men
know it's their last chance to keep
the season from being wholly a fail-
ure—as well as their best chance to
do so. Then too, that picture of Mr.
Stagg in the dressing room after Sat-
urday's game ought to stick with the
team—the Old Man sitting there quiet-
ly in the middle of all the after-game
activity, his head in his hands and ut-
terly silent. The remembrance of him
at that moment ought to put a little
fire in the men Saturday—a little any-
way. .

* ♦ ♦ •

As for the rest of the games set for
the end of the week, I should not be
surprised to see Iowa knock off North-
western and Minnesota beat Michi-
gan. Both games ought to go the
other way on form, but still I have
always had confidence in the Hawks
through all their defeats, having seen
them play very good football indeed
against Illinois, while Minnesota has
developed undeniable crushing power
in its last three games, and by Satur-
day ought to be able to give anyone
a good run. If the Gopher backs keep
their heads up on passes, there doesn't
seem to be a whole lot more that they
need do, for Michigan hasn’t a whole
lot in the way of a running game that
need bother such a bunch of hone-
crushers as Dr. Spears has in the line.
On straight slashing offensive power,
Minnesota has it on any of them. Iowa,
as I saw it against Illinois, had a bet-
ter line than Northwestern, and a pret-
ty good running game built around
Kutsch. While Minnesota is the bet-
ter bet of the two teams, I distinctly
think Iowa cannot be counted out yet.

* * * *

No matter what happens to the
Maroons Saturday (and I think it may
turn out that things may happen to
the other team instead), prospects are
good for next fall. Krogh and Spence
are back for ends, Weislow, Lewis and
two enormous freshmen named Weav-
er and Ellison, neither of whom play-
ed freshman this fall ,are on hand for
tackles, and Wolff and Heitman re-
turn for guards. Ken Rouse, as good
as centers come, will be there, and
Fulton. McDonough, Anderson, Ley-
ers and Gleason, among others, will
be left in the backfield. Mendenhall
of the freshmen is a fine quarterback
that would help things out a lot, and
Burgess, another freshman, and Kel-
ly. the ineligible, will do any day for
me at halfback. As Pollyana justly
’’emarked, things just around the cor-
ner don’t look ’arf bad.

SECOND ANNUAL
MIRROR TODAY

O’Hara Directs Production;

Parker, Evans, Downing
Chosen Aids

The second annual Mirror begins its
work today, twelve weeks before rais-
ing of Mandel hall curtains upon its
finished product. At 3:30 this after-
noon, tryouts will be held in Ida Noyes
theater, and from the hordes expected
about fifty women will be selected,
according to Betty Graham, president
of Mirror.

“Backed by a four-man array of tal-
ent, and aided by the physical culture
department,” asserts Miss Graham,
“Mirror goes into action with remark-
able prospects. Mr. Frank H. O'Hara
has consented to be general director
of the production, Mr. Mack Evans
to assist in directing and singing, Mr.
Frank Parker to direct the dancing,
and Mr. George Downing to advise in
the scenic effects. Miss Gertrude Dud-
ley has agreed to give partial credit in
physical culture for the dancing
classes.”

All women students interested in
dancing in the Mirror .including fresh-
man women .have been asked to ap-
pear before Mr. Parker this after-
noon.

Frank Parker is a former star of
the Dramatic Association, having ap-
peared in many of its productions, in-
cluding the first American presentation
of Bernard Shaw’s “Press Cuttings,"
and was a star of several successive
Blackfriar shows. After leaving the

Middies and West Pointers, the Fri-
day evening preceding the Army-
Navy game, when the entire Drake
Hotel will be turned over to the 4,000
guests of the Chicago committee for
the game.

Besides the 150 “blind dates” from
the Chicago campus, a like number
will be drawn from Northwestern, and
the remainder from the society and
business world. Fifteen men from each
of the two universities, men who have
had wide social experience, will be
selected to act as ushers for the even-
ing and to introduce the women to
the cadets.

Although Edith Foster Flint, chair-
man of the women’s council at the
University, has announced the com-

Frosh Forum Airs

Views On Petting

“Petting vs. Popularity” was
heatedly discussed at the meeting
of the Freshman Forum yesterday
in Cobb 110.

Approximately thirty-five men
and women of the freshman class
put forth views ranging from the
statement that “Petting is a clean
sport,” to “No one likes a second
hand article.”

One of the members maintained
that unless one has experience in
petting, married life is apt to be a
failure. The point was refuted by
calling attention to Hoolywood, its
petting and its divorce record.

Prince Wishes He
Could Study Here

Prince Nicholas of Roumania,
smiled affably as a representative
of The Daily Maroon, disguised as
a marshal approached him in the
President’s office yesterday.

“I like your school, from what
I have seen of it,” he said. “You
have a great undergraduate body
here. I wish I could stay and be
one of you.”

Psych Prof. Fools
’Em On Telepathy

Mental privacy is once more in-
sured against the wiles of telepathy.
The classes of Miss Margaret Wil-
son, instructor in the University
psychology department, were
throwm into a furor when an appar-
ently successful experiment showed
that the internal workings of the
cranium were not safe from tele-
pathic mediums. A bona fide medi-
um divulged astounding informa-
tion during the experiment. Means
by which this could have been con-
ducted were suggested when the
classes convened today.

When fraud was implied by one
skeptic, Miss Miller admitted having
purposely duped the class.

“Your Majesty—Mr. Mason.”

With these four words the symbol
of the institution of power met the
symbol of the institution of knowledge
in the office of the president of the
University yesterday afternoon. Ira
Nelson Morris, Chicago’s host to the
Roumanian party, performed the intro-
duction.

Two thousand students did their
best to overwhelm the squad of thirty
policement guarding the west campus
entrance to Harper library as the sex-
tet of limousines emptied its burden
of sovereigns at 3:45. The University
reception committee, assisted by the
student marshals and aides, escorted
Queen Marie, Princess Ileana and
Crown Prince Nicholas into Presi-
dent Mason’s sanctum, from which the
royal group emerged five minutes la-
ter to keep up with their crowded
schedule.

After chatting with the president
the queen signed the register of uni-
versity guests and then accepted a
copy of “The Nature of the World and
Man,” on the fly-leaf of which was
inscribed:

“This book is the basis of the lat-
est educational experiment at the Uni-
versity of Chicago.

“As a symbol of the unity of the
world of letters and science, it is
presented to her Majesty, Queen Marie
of Roumania, on the occasion of her
visit to the University.”

The official reception committee of
the University consisted of President
Max Mason, Vice-president F. C.
Woodward. Harold H. Swift, presi-
dent of the board of trustees, Deans
Gordon J. Laing. Henry Gordon Gale,
and Edith Foster Flint. Major F. M.
Barrows. U. S. A., President Emeritus
Harry Pratt Judson, and Professors

He left her company to serve in the
World War. Thereafter he was with

THE UNIVERSITY ENTERTAINS A GUEST

Q

UEEN MARIE, ruler of Roumania, and the first royal head of a
> foreign nation to set foot on the campus, drove to the Univer-

sity yesterday in an ostentatious automobile, received the expect-
ed greeting from students and faculty, returned a conventional smile,
and continued on her extensive tour of the city.

Without doubt, she was received in a manner that was entirely
fitting to the principles and spirit of the University. There were no
elaborate decorations denoting the event, no brass bands blaring
forth Roumanian national anthems, no extensive speeches read ex-
pounding immoderately the pleasure which her presence gave us.
Instead, she entered through one door and was immediately escorted
by the aides and marshals to the President’s office; there President
Max Mason cordially greeted her, as he would greet, on behalf of
the University, any well-known guest. In addition, he presented her
with the book entitled ‘The Nature of the World and Man,’ a distinct
achievement of the University faculty, as a slight token of our es-
teem. She was escorted to her car, and the interrupted routine of
campus life was resumed. ,

We are glad to see that all “kow-towing ’ was absent. In other
places and at other times, great stir has been made over her visit.
She must possess enough honorary keys of various places to neces-
sitate the addition to her party of a royal “keeper of the keys.”
Here, however, there was a simple ceremony. A leader of a nation

paid her respects to a leader in the field of education.

ONE MORE CHANCE

$TAGG’ s MAROONS have one more chance, and the best chance.
M at that, to win a conference game this season. Next Saturday
we meet Wisconsin, the team that has run closest to the Maroons
in the race for the tail end of the division.

But win or lose, Chicago crowds this year haven’t lost their
faith in the Old Man, or for one moment felt that the eleven men on

the field haven’t been giving the best that is in them.

Green, raw, inexperienced in the ways of Big Ten football
teams, the Staggmen have fought through a heavy schedule, holding
the much-vaunted Illini team to one touchdown, holding the best
team that Purdue has had for decades to one touchdown, playing
well against Ohio, and making one touchdown against a title con-
tender.

By the time a team has lost three games most schools begin to
lost interest, and io watch them with a sort of aloofness. Ma
roon rooters last Saturday at Northwestern showed that the game
is the thing, not the score. 14,000 south side rooters watched the
Maroons take the worst lacing that has been administered them for
a long time. But the 1 4,000 rooters stuck with the team and cheered
the men who were fighting a lop-sided tilt, that was all N. U.

And when the game was over “Alma Mater” sounded better
than it has at any other game of the year. Sedate? Dignified?
Lacking spirit? Behind Illinois, and the other state schools, in
team support? Watch the final blowoff at the Wisconsin game.

Transportation by Railroad

The business of a railroad is to move passengers and
freight. To carry on this business involves a good
many lines of work. The actual running of the trains
is administered, however, by one highly organized
branch of a railroad's operating department. This
branch, often called the transportation department,
plans and puts into operation a railroad’s passenger and
freight train service. Time tables worked out by it
provide instructions for operation and schedules for
the convenient and comfortable handling of passengers,
baggage, mail and express and the timely and econom-
ical handling of freight.

Adequate passenger train service requires ample sta-
tion facilities and well-lighted, well-heated and well-
ventilated passenger cars, including sleeping, dining and
other special cars, the through operation of cars be-
tween important centers, perhaps over several lines, and
other items of varying importance, on down to the
provision of newspapers and even market reports.

Freight train service, to be adequate, must be care-
fully planned and maintained as to schedule and must
be properly divided among the following classes: faster
and more lightly loaded trains to handle dispatch com-
modities, such as fruit, vegetables, livestock, high-class
merchandise and the like; slower and more economical-
ly loaded trains to handle coal, lumber, ore, steel, grain
and other so-called “tonnage” commodities; local
freight service picked up and deliver carload and less-
than-carload traffic along the line; switching service in
terminals to gather up, classify and deliver cars.

Seasonal traffic and the varying conditions of busi-
ness demand careful handling of a railroad’s supply of
freight cars. Close contact and co-operation with ship-
pers and advance knowledge of the progressive ma-
turity. volume and movement .of products enable a
railroad to construct and install necessary equipment in
advance of requirements and to distribute its cars effi-
cietly. Specialized types, such as refrigerator cars
dump and self-clearing coal cars and the like, must be
assigned only to certain kinds of work.

l'he handling of perishable freight requires special
care. Stations for icing and re-icing refrigerator cars
must he properly located. Convenient facilities must
be supplied for receiving, transmitting and executing
instructions covering changes in the refrigeration, ven-
tilation and heating of cars in perishable freight serv-
ice, as well as for reconsignment or change in destina-
tion to insure proper market distribution. A good many
railroads also maintain special sendee bureaus to insure
prompt, continuous and uniform movement of all traf-
fic and to provide shippers and consignees with infor-
mation concerning the whereabouts of their shipments.

The transportation department saves money for a
railroad and its patrons by watching traffic conditions
in other parts of the country, in order that surplus and
special type of cars, owned to protect seasonal traffic,
may be profitably rented to other roads when not
needed at home and that corresponding use may be
made of such cars belonging to other roads, thereby
minimizing ownership expense.

Constructive criticism and suggestions are invited.

Seeing is believing.

Anyone who saw the Wildcats in
action against the lowly Maroons last
Saturday should be convinced that
Northwestern was not bluffing about
her Big Ten championship possibilities.
Her final game is with Iowa another
lowly outfit, this Saturday and the
Wildcats should find no trouble in
emerging from this battle with a clean
slate for the year.

Victory is sweet.

There never was a sweeter victory
than 17 to 16 win which the Wolver-
ines experienced over the Buckeyes
last Saturday. It saved the hour, the
day, and maybe the year for Yost’s
team. If it wasn’t for the tough game

that
“if,”

Minnesota next Saturday, Mich-
could rave about her Champion-
possibilities with the confidence
Northwestern can. But it’s a big
when the Minnesota team is con-

cerned, for the Gophers are famed for
the wrecking of title hopes.

What the Gophers did for Chicago
two years ago when they eliminated
Illinois from the Conference race,
Northwestern is counting on them to
do for her this year. And the Wild-
cats have good reason to count on it,
for the Gophers have been gaining
momentum with each contest, beating
the Badgers by a large score a week
ago, and winning over the crafty But-
ler Eleven 81 to 0 last Saturday with
reserves in the entire last half. Michi-
gan will have a game.

IOWA LOSES ONLY
ONE CAGE VETERAN

Victory will not be the only prize
sought by Purdue and Indiana in their
annual football game next Saturday
afternoon in the Ross-Ade stadium,
for possession of- the “old oaken buc-
ket” will be decided by the result oi
the contest.

The bucket tradition was originated
last year, the idea of Purdue and In-
diana alumni living in Chicago, but no 1
disposition was made of it following I
the tie game of last season, except that j
it was left at Indiana. It will arrive J
at Purdue tomorrow and will be on
display here. If Purdue wins, it will
occupy an honor place on the campus,
or if the Crimson is victorious it will be
returned to Bloonyngton. From the
standpoint of “dope” the bucket will
be Purdue’s after the game.

The idea is similar to the “little
brown jug” tradition of Michigan and
Minnesota, which will also be at stake

After a week of inactivity Intra-
mural athletics are coming into their
own again. Old Man Winter called
forth many postponements and cancel-
lations of games but after much re-
scheduling the Department is embark-
ing on an extremely busy and vigorous
week.

There are seven touchball and four
horseshoe games scheduled for today
in the fraternity league, and five horse-
shoe games in the club league. In
horseshoes, in the Club League, the
Cardinals and Burtons are meeting at
3, the Macs and Campus Terrors, Car-
dinals and Romans at 3:30, the Mac
and Cardinals, Romans and Burtons
at 4. In horseshoes, in the Fraternity
League. Chi Psi and Kappa Nu, Phi
Sigma Delta and Tau Delta Phi at 3.
Zeta Beta Tau and Kappa Nu t 3,
and Kappa Sigma and Kappa Nu at 4.

Today in the Graduate League the
Meadvilles forfeited to the Chicago
Theological Seminary. Last Friday in
the same league the Theologians de-
feated the Divinities 24 to 0, Carpenter
making four touchdowns. In the Club
League, the Cardinals and the Burtons
fought to a scoreless tie on a muddy
field. Today in the same league, the
Cardinals defeated the Campus Ter-
rors 12 to 0, and the Manors forfeited
to the Burtons.

ily for the also-rans of the yearling
squad. This new affair will be held
next Monday starting at 3 on Stagg

made an annual game.

Anderson In Uniform—Leads Pass Drill In Preparation
For Wide Open Game; Wisconsin Holds
Edge In Conference Showing

• By Tom Stephenson

Practice last night at Stagg Field
showed that the team has returned
home in better shape than might be
expected after its battle with the fero-
cious Wildcats last Saturday. Even
Anderson, who was carried off the
Northwestern field after playing the
best game of his career, was out in
uniform and was going at it with “wim
and wigor” along with the rest of the
boys.

game against the Boilermakers, the
Badgers are coming for their “Big
Game” with the dope in their favor.
Coach Little was rated at the opening
of the season as having one of the out-
standing Conference squads, but his
championship hopes failed to material-
ize and it is so much the better for
him if he can end the season with a
victory. But a win would mean more
to the lowly Maroons for it is their
final chance to win a conference game.

More Passes

The Old Man continued to drill his
men in forward passes. The success of
the improved aerial attack and the
open formations which he taught the
team last week, as evidenced in the
second quarter of the Northwestern
game, warrants the continuation of
this type of practice. It is the custom
to open up in the final game of the
season and in order to do that there
must be an abundance of new plays
and unusued formations to open up
with. This accounts for the light prac-
tice of last evening, and it is very
probable that signal drills on the open
game will characterize the sessions
for the early part of the week.

Wisconsin, as usual, has been point-
ing to the Chicago game. With a vic-
tory over the Hawkeyes, and a tie

SEE OHIO-ILLINOIS
GAME AS THRILLER

Just because Ohio State missed a
try for goal after touchdown against
Michigan, that one point isn’t going
to prevent the Ohio-Illinois game in
the Illinois stadium Saturday from
being one of the most important bat-
tles ever fought in the Illinois stadium.

For Illinois, victory will insure a
topnotch position in the Big Ten rank-
ings, especially if Minnesota happens
to conquer Michigan. In that event
Michigan, Illinois and Ohio State all

by common-sense rating would
placed on an equal basis and if
unexpected should occur and Iowa
set Northwestern, it looks as if

be
the
up-
the

only fair rating would be a four-sided
tie.

of the 1926 season to win all six and
to tie Michigan, Purdue and Indiana
for the championship, only one man
has been lost.

WHEREVER you travel, by sea or

palaces of pleasure, you find the
friends of Camel. And since the
art of increasing life’s comfort
through smoking was discovered,
no other cigarette ever made and
kept so many friends.

Why does Camel lead the world?
Because only the choicest Turkish
and Domestic tobaccos are bought
for Camels. Because Camel is given
a blending that, regardless of price,

can be found in no other cigarette.
Because the world’s largest to*
bacco organization spares neither
cost nor effort to make Camel the
utmost in cigarettes.

Camel rewards its friends with
never-ending peace and satisfac*
tion. Through the day and into
the night, it’s simply impossible to
smoke enough Camels to tire the
taste. We invite you to answer,
now, the world’s most popular
smoke invitation—Have a Camel!
