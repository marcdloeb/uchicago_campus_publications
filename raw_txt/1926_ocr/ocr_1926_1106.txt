WHAT OF
IT?

fyGeot&Mn&nstetn

A report has gone around that paid
operatives of the enemy have been
working through the week in an ef-
fort to put Captain Wally Marks of
the Maroons into such shape that he
will be unable to do himself full jus-
tice against Illinois this afternoon. It
began Thursday,, when Wally was
prevailed to go over to the Trianon,
that shrine of the more humble de-
votees of the dance on Cottage Grove
avenue. Announcements of Marks’
appearance were broadcast earlier in
the week, and when Wally appeared
on Mr. Andrew Karzas’ well-oiled
floor, he was greeted by all the belles
of Forty-seventh street and points
south. The Trianon “Ballroom Top-
ics" of last Sunday had this to say
about who would be the ones to keep
Wally busy through the evening:
“Numbers will be distributed to every
lady attending, and a drawing will be
held, the lucky numbers drawn en-
titling the holders to a dance with
Wally. These selected ladies will also
appear in moving pictures with Wally
which will be taken at the ballroom.
Everybody attending the ’Campus
Frolics’ will get in on the movies.
Here’s your chance folks—don’t for-
get next Thursday at the Trianon.”

* * • •

It is a matter of record that Wally
submitted himself to the arduous pro-
gram outlined by Mr. Andrew Karzas,
in conjunction with Mr. Tom Sheehy,
Mr. Karzas’ estimable local agent. He
danced with the "lucky numbers” and
was filmed with the crowd at the
‘Campus Frolics.’ It was a big eve-
ning. And then, the next day—only
yesterday, Wally came back for more
punishment. He got up in time for
Phil Allen’s eleven o’clock, took his
daily workout under the fatherly eye
of Mr. Stagg, ate his dinner at the
Sigma Nu house, combed his hair, and
repaired to Mr. Andrew Karzas’ Ara-
gon, shrine of the North Side slaves
of la danse! At the Aragon Wally
went through with the same program
as the night before. Again he danced
with the “selected ladies,” and again he
was filmed with the “lucky numbers.”
That, as I say was only last night.

* * * *

But there is still more. Earlier yes-
terday, before trekking to the Ara-
gon, Wally appeared around the cam-!
pus in a new roadster, bearing on its [
spare tire cover the legend,

WALLY MARKS

Captain, Chicago Football Team
Courtesy Car

Popoff Motors

In this sumptuous vehicle Wally oc-
cupied his leisure hours. He was seen
about Cobb, and Jackson Park. When,
during practice, Wally was forced to
abandon his roadster, he seemed pre-
occupied, his mind somewhere else.

♦ * ♦ ♦

I merely detail all these things as
indicative of one fact—that it must
all be part of some preconcerted
scheme on the part of the enemy to
lessen Wally’s mechanical advantage
to Mr. Stagg and dear old Chicago
this afternoon. But after all, I sup-
pose, when a man can enjoy the ad-
vantages of a roadster and hordes of
adoring “selected ladies,” why should
he not do so? There are few of us
poor mortals, who looking at Wally
with his roadster and “lucky num-
bers,” can refrain from thinking in our
hearts: “There, but for the perversity
of God, go I” The moral to all this, I
suppose, is: “If ya get the breaks, ya
get ’em; if ya don’t, shut up”

* ♦ ♦ ♦

But, as a loyal Chicago man, who
does not forge't the team in his night-
ly prayers, I hope that Mr. Marks’
verve and efficiency are not lessened
by his recent social obligations.

HOMECOMERS VIEW BIG GAME

“YALE” DOWNS “HARVARD”

FROSH PERFORM
WELL FOR GRADS
IN ANNUAL GAME

Blue Team Scores Early
In Battle; Outshines

Crimson Outfit

A long pass, Mendenhall to Burgess
spelled defeat for the Harvard co-
horts in yesterday’s annual Freshman
tilt held before a huge Homecoming
crowd. The fi nal score of 7-0 tells
little of the type of play exhibited, as
the Crimson was at no time able to
penetrate the Bulldog’s defense, while
they offered little opposition to the
Blues attack.

Five minutes after play had been
started, and after an exchange of punts
the Blue scored 011 a twenty yard pass
with which the receiver galloped the
same distance to cross the goal line.
Burgess then kicked the goal to end

Players Nervous

The game was marked by frequent
fumbles and penalties on both sides.
Both these miscues can be traced to
the same source —nervousness. The
yearlings were too anxious in their
big game of the season. Except for
this fault they played much like vet-
erans, showing a diversity of attack,
and a style of play which would have
put teams of much greater experience
to shame.

Many Stars

Burgess of the Yale squad proved
the star of the game, smashing througr
the line and backing up his forward
wall with equal ability. The passing
of Holahan also a Blue player, spoke
well for the success of next year's var-
sity aerial attack. Other players who
shotwed up well were Riddle, Brown,
Priess, Greer, and Abbott of the win-
ning team, and McCurry, Wattenberg
of the losers.

The Yale line proved to be excep-
tionally strong, breaking up every
thing which was hurled against it,
while they charged so fiercely that
practically every Crimson play was
smashed before it had fairly gained
momentum.

Harvard Threatens

Harvard’s one chance to score fail-
ed to materialize when an attempted
place kick from the 25 yard line in
the second quarter was blocked by
Brown. Yale recovered the ball and
pulled well out of danger.

Practically every man on the fresh-
man rooster saw action during the
course of the afternoon as frequent
substitutions were made on both
sides.

Weddell Follows Stagg On Injury

List; Is Latest Maroon Casualty

Chicago Holds Edge With Sixteen
Wins, Ten Losses; Three Ites

Marks’ New Auto

Holds Alligator

Cars and football captaincies go
hand in hand in these days of rapid
progress, it seems. The latest bul-
letin is that Wallie Marks will be
seen from now until Thanksgiving
travelling about in a Chrysler “80”
roadster presented by the Chrys-
ler Motor Company.

This vehicle is of the latest con-
struction, affording accommoda-
tions for alligators and such in the
rumble seat. No wonder there is
such competition between the boys.

Important

With Chicago meeting Illinois, Pur-
due and Northwestern clashing, Mich-
igan and Wisconsin springing at each
others throats, and Iowa bumping
against Minnesota, the standings in
the Big Ten will be noticeably chang-
ed after this afternoons games It
looks like Northwestern, Michigan,
Minnesota and Illinois will be on the
heavy ends of the scores.

Its homecoming out at Northwes-
tern today too, and the undefeated
Purple team is scheduled to rub el-
bows with Purdue before a crowd of
45.000.

Wildcats Favored

The Northwestern team looks
stronger than the Boilermakers and
has the advantage of playing on its
own field before an enthusiastic crowd.

AWARD DELTA SIGMA
PHI FOR ELABORATE

HOUSE DECORATIONS I

Delta Sigma Phi's Homecoming dec-
orations took first honors in the con-
test conducted by the Inter-fraternity
Council, it was announced at the Pep
Session last evening.

A “flash of lightning,” represented
by a huge electric sign, and culminat-
in a big “Go-Chicago” was the main
idea in the winning design. It was
awarded the Shield after a committee
composed of Vice-Pres. Woodward,
Frank O’Hara, and Mrs. Merrill had
carefully considered all of the elab-
orate decorations sported along Frat-
ernity Row.

Janies Cusack, president of The
Council, highly commended the work
of the committee in charge of the
House Decorations Contest. This
committee was headed by Sydney Col-
lins, who was aided by James Black,
Fred Von Ammon and Chuck War-
ner.

Bill Weddell, head cheerleader, will
be unable to perform in his official
capacity today At the pep meeting
held Thursday evening outside Stagg
Field, Bill sprained his ankle while
leading a skyrocket yell. Although his
ankle did not give any trouble for sev-
eral hours, late reports indicated that
he would be disabled for today’s
game. Weddell is the second non-
combatant to be injured this week,
Coach Stagg having received a “char-
ley-horse” when he got mixed up in
a scrimmage Wednesday. One of Wed-
dell’s assistants or some returning
alumni cheerleader will take Bill’s
place today.

Greatest Spirit
In Years Sends

Team To Battle

Three days of pep sessions ended
this afternoon when the “C” section
of the Maroon rooters snake danced
their way into the stadium. Starting at
Bartlett Gymnasium, the dance wound
through fraternity row and the cam-
pus and turned back towards the sta-
dium ending in the “C” section.

Students packed Mandel hall last
night and made the campus ring with
cheers for the Maroons and a victory.
The crowd filled the auditorium and
spread into the corridors. Preceding
the big session, what cheer leaders
called the biggest demonstration ever
seen on the University campus, sev-
eral hundred students executed a
snake dance around the campus and
the University district.

Thursday afternoon the Frosh and
the band practiced their cheers, while
the Varsity practiced bucking Illinois
plays.

“We have tried harder than ever
before to bring the crowds out to the
pep session and to inspire the “Beat Il-
linois” spirit this last week. Last night
showed that Chicago crowds have
more pep than the students of any
other school in the conference. Now
all that we have to do is beat Illi-
nois this afternoin,” declared Bill Wed-
delll, head cheer leader.

“All-Star” Teams
Score on Passes

The “All-Star” touchball game, in-
troduced by the I-M Department as
a part of this year’s Homecoming cel-
ebration, rivaled the Frosh “Yale-
Harvard” game in interest yesterday
afternoon.

The "Maroons,” coming back in the
second half to intercept passes and
turn them into scoring plays, over-
came a 6-0 lead that the “Jugglers”
held all through the first period. They
won the game by a 12 to 6 score on
forward passes to Gordon and Pollard.
The Jugglers also got their score on
a long pass, Bartlett to Scherubal.

Other stars of the g ame were Jim
Curtain and George Lott for the vic-
tors, and Verg Gist and Total Arm-
strong for the Jugglers.

The players were selected from Frat-,
ernity and Club League teams because
of excellent playing during the sea-
son. The game was held on Crisler
Field, and was rerereed by Bill King.

All other touchball games for the
day were called off in order to center
the interest on this big affair. Accord-

ing to Gordon Wallace, Intramural
Manager, the game is to be made an
annual event to serve as entertain-

ment for Homecomers each year, and
to give the players something to work
for during the season.

LOYAL ALUMNI RETURN TO
CHEER MIDWAY ELEVEN IN
TOUGH SCRAP WITH ILLINI

Turn Out For Classic
Struggle Eighteen

Thousand Strong

A generation of old grads—eighteen
thousand of them—have come home to
revoice their mouldy cheers and un-
dying, if somewhat musty, spirit for
Coach Stagg’s bloody but unbowed
Maroons. And that same generation
has come home not only to peer from
the grandstand with a “....now in
’95...” but also to see how the old

school has managed to pull along
without them for the past two, five,
or twenty years.

The campus has opened its arms to
its sons and daughters, and the under-
graduates have escorted the eighteen
thousand around the quadrangles,
showing them with fact and fancy that
things have changed.

But they have also been shown some
things that never change,—the “old
Chicago spirt,” for instance, which is
the same now “....as in ’95...”

Yesterday afternoon they witnessed
Fritz Crisler’s fighting Freshmen in
action, then proceeded to the Mixer
at Ida Noyes hall.

Last night’s ruckus started with the
alumni dinner in Hutchinson com-
mons. From there the eighteen thou-
sand adjourned to Mandel hall to join
the big pep session.

After the fuss is over, the eighteen
thousand will pour into various and
sundry fraternity houses, club houses,
theatres and other odd places—prob-
ably to tell the boys how it was
“.... in ’95.”

CHICAGO’S MAMMOTH
DRUM MAKES FIRST
APPEARANCE OF YEAR

Chicago’s big brass drum makes its
first appearance of the season, today
at 1:10 in front of Mandel hall.

On a balloon tired vehicle drawn
by two men, it will take its place
midst a bevy of bandsmen in the pro-
cession from Mandel and over Stagg
Field. E. L. Milkwick, as drummer,
will do his bit by making resounding
noises issue forth.

The drum, eight feet one inch in
diameter was presented to Chicago by
C. D. Greenleaf of the class of eighty-
nine. Two large stears from the Chi-
cago Stockyards were required to
make the heads which are of one piece
each. Due to miscarried plans, the
drum has not been out at previous
games this year.

A shore perusal of the following list
shows that since 1893, Chicago has
won 16, tied 3, and lost 10 games to
Illinois.

1893—Chi. 12; Ill. 28.

1894—Chi. 10; Ill. 6.

1806—Chi. 12; Ill. 0.

1897—Chi 18; Ill. 12.

The Maroons will again go into the
game this afternoon as under-dogs,
for the fourth Saturday in a row,
doped to go down to almost certain
defeat. Nevertheless a crowd of 50,-
000 will be on hand, among them
cheering students, hopeful alumni, con-
fident Illini and sarcastic LaSalle
Street coaches.

Anybody’s Game—Zuppke

One person not overly confident of
an Illinois victory is Coach Bob Zup-
pke. Yesterday while the Illini were
snapping through their signals on
Stagg field Zuppke said, “It will be
anybody’s game.” And he said it as
if he meant it.

Zuppke also announced that Cap-
tain Kassel, all-conference end last
season who has been troubled with
knee injuries this year, would start.
Stewart, halfback, will also start in
spite of a bad shoulder. Gallivan and
Green, former running mates of
Grange, will be ready to fill in.

Lineup Uncertain

Stagg was still uncertain about his
opening lineup last night. He might
start Marks at a full and then have the
above team play, and then again he
mightn’t. In the lattef case Marks
will play half in McKinney’s place
with Leyers at full. Kyle Anderson
has almost recovered from his knee
injury received in the Purdue game
so he will probably get into the game
sooner or later.

Besides the game itself there will
be some other things to entertain the
eye and ear of the vest congregation.
The famous Illinois band will be there
—at least 160 pieces of it; and Frosty
Peters, the butt of the Illinois public-
ity this year, will also be there with
his boots on. He is the dropkicker
extraordinary who kicked a hole into
Penn’s hopes for a national crampion-
ship last week.

Fans To Say It
With Megaphones

Both teams will be backed by
high-powered yelling in today’s bat-
tle. The volume of the Rah-Rah-
Rah’s will be amplified greatly by
especially constructed megaphones
supplied by A. Starr Best. Five
hundred of these amplifiers, bearing
the school colors have been distri-
buted through each of the rival
cheering sectiins. Similar mega-
phones were distributed at the
Northwestern-Purdue and at the
important high school games

IF ENTHUSIASM MEANS ANYTHING”

ND in a few more hours it will be all over and most of us will be
1 wondering what it was all about. That applies not only to the

football game, but to the entire Homecoming program.

Ever since the idea of Homecoming was first suggested we have
enthusiastically supported it . At Chicago we are used to seeing
alumni return to the campus during the football season. More
than 15,000 of those at the game this afternoon will be alumni who
live in Chicago.

(Continued from page 1)
not shown any conference team this
year. But the fray today will not be
decided by passes. If Purdue with its
crippled tackles can nail the big three
of the Northwestern team, Lewis,
Gustafson and Baker and can through
the strong Northwestern defense for
at least one touchdown, then they
might tip the score the right way.

Michigan Desperate

The Wolverines and the Badgers
meet at Ann Arbor, in the third Home
coming affair of the afternoon. Still
smarting under the 10-0 defeat at the
hands of the Navy last week, Yosts
aggregation is primed to tear into the
Wisconsin lads and show its stuff.
With their conference record still
clear the Michigan squads looks to
“Bennie” Friedman and his two de-
pendable ends, Oosterbaan and Flora
to complete a few long passes during
the game.

In the Cardinal lineup. Burrus and
Straubel veteran forwards will be miss-
ing, due to injuries received last Sat-
urday. The Badgers stopped along the
road for a secret practice and will not
arrive on the scene till just before
game time. The Cardinal game will
center around a defense a against
Friedman and his two ends.

Iowa Meets Gophers

Of less interest is the game between
Iowa and Minnesota at the Iowa Field.
Iowa, with nothing but conference de-
feats tacked to her fair name, will try
to put across her first victory for the
benefit of a crowd of 27,000 home-
comers.

Although Iowa outweighs the Min-
nesotans eight pounds to the man, the
Gophers look like the stronger team.
Seventeen on the Minnesota squad
have a year, or more experience on
the 'football field. Joesting, of the
Gophers, is expected to rip big holes
in the heavy Hawkeye team, through
which Peplaw and Almquist, hard run-
ning backs are expected to follow.

The Gophers have brushed up their
forward pass attack and expect to
cross the goal line with their new of-
fense. Byers and Kutsch of Iowa will
bear the brunt of the running against
the Gophers.

Indiana and Notre Dame play an-
other of the interesting clashes today,
while Ohio has a practice game sched-
uled.

The other alumni are the ones for whom Homecoming is de-
signed primarily. It is an effort to bring back to the Alma Mater
those who live away from the University, so that they may have
their grand reunion with the thousands who live here, run all over
the campus once more, and see a good football game.

The first part of the Homecoming program this year has been
a huge success. The pep session last night drew a great crowd. If
enthusiasm means anything the Maroons will walk off the field this
afternoon with the big end of the score.

Tonight there will be a conclusion to the two day program
and it will be all over until next year. This Homecoming, the sec-
ond annual Homecoming, was greater than that of last year. Next
year it will be still greater.

But before it is over get in your share of the fun . . . while you
are in the stands this afternoon, forget that the dignity of Chicago
ever existed . . and BEAT ILLINOIS!!

SEATS

THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS has a habit of entertaining an
* unofficial complaint that the University of Chicago engages in
the annual viciousness of depriving them of all the good seats
and most of the total seats for the Illinois-Chicago game. But we
have heard more than that specific plaint this year; another howl
of indignation has presaged the Illini arrival: we did not give them
enough seats for their band. All in all, it begins to look as though
the Greatest State School has fallen into the ineffectual disposition
of unofficial complaining.

Rumors spread to the effect that Illinois threatened a rupture of
athletic relations with us because we had limited their visiting band
to one hundred pieces. These rumors were built, perhaps, on the
imagination of the press, but they were none the less unpleasant. In
limiting the Illinois band to one hundred pieces, we were comply-
ing with the conference agreement of last spring to that effect. Which
fact clinches the argument from any point of view.

Lester F. Blair, director of the football tickets office of the Uni-
versity, informs us that 12,500 seats have been allotted to he Cham-
paign crowd. They have been given the entire east stand, 5,000
seats in the south stand, and 1,000 seats in the west stand. And
that is the best tha a ciy of ^3,000,000 persons can do for a univer-
siy town—any university town. The University of Illinois football
ticket manager is satisfied with his allottment. And his word is of-
ficial.

“College Morals” Take Foremost Position Before

World’s Eyes

CAMPUS LIFE AS
MAIN SOURCE OF

SCANDAL‘SCOOP’

News Sheets Turn Search-
Lights On Social Life

Of Student World

“College Morals,” the ‘‘Degenera-
tion of Youth,” “Are College Women
Bad?”.and the “Illini Campus” accord-
ing to Mr. Cross, seem to be up to the
minute subjects for aspiring editorial
and feature writers.

We have at hand an article which
has gone successively through the
press of “The Chicago Daily News,”
‘The Literary Digest,” and a Uni-
versity of North Carolina publication.
Another is on the desk which has been
reprinted in the Ohio 'University
semi-weekly from “The Christian Cen-
tury" of Chicago. Both are articles on
college morals. Daily papers from
coast to coast have been featuring Mr.
Cross. Whether he has provoked this
onslaught, or whether the onslaught
aroused him, we do not know.

Cros» and Aristotle Agree

One specific question brought to
our attention is "Are College Students
Bad?” Mr. Cross wags his head in the
affirmative. Aristotle, or someone
equally as ancient, is known to have
lamented the days of his youth, when
young people had more common sense.
It seems that we have inherited a bad
reputation, and our Illini acquaintance
is out to exaggerate.

One hundred years ago, according to
"The Literary Digest,” there was one
Christian Communicant on the Prince-
ton campus. The University is now
erecting a $1,700,000 chapel. The Uni-

versity of Illinois has expended $2,-
000,000 in the last few years in erect-
ing buildings and furnishing equip-
ment to aid in the advancement of the
spiritual welfare of the students. A
dean to head a School of Religion has
recently been installed at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. Is this con-
sistent with Cross’ theory? Is this
money being spent to force religion
onto young people, or because they
have expressed a desire for expansion
in this field?

Quote Daily News

As a final argument we cite this
quotation from “The Chicago Daily
News.” “Religious life in the colleges
has never been at a higher level than
it is now, nor has it been marked
previously by such tolerance and good
will as prevails at present.”

SofCial Sphere

There’s plenty to keep us busy this
week-end and not the least important
is the informal Homecoming Night
dance, an alumni affair, at the Rey-

orchestras will play to accommodate
the crowds.

Campus Gets Collection of Interesting Oreodant Mammals
Unearthed in Wyoming Hill Country.

A collection of interesting fossil mammals of an extinct branch of
the oreodants group which was discovered this summer by Dr. Paul C.
Miller, associate curator of Walker Museum, has been added to the
collection of geological exhibitions in Walker museum.

The fossils were found embedded about five feet below the surface
of the ground in the hills of Wyoming near the Nebraska state line.
They are related to the pig and camel group, the distinction being gased
largely upon the formation of the hoofs and the teeth. This extinct
animal possessed the cloven hoof and teeth of a nature which indicates
that it belongs to the group of grass-eaters.

Found in Groups

The collection consists of one com
plete skeleton and parts of three oth-
ers which were found grouped to-
gether as though in the time of a
storm they had felt that there was
safety in numbers and had huddled to-
gether for protection, only to be
trapped and left to perish. “It is not
uncommon to find groups of mammals
together,” said Dr. Miller, “for evi-
dences of whole herds of buffalo and
thousands of other animals have fre-
quently been found in the depths of
hills and cliffs. When this occurs, it is
the assumption that they were prob-
ably suddenly overtaken by some dis-
aster.”

“The quest for ancient mammals is
mainly a gamble.” Dr. Miller contin-
ued. “for it is impossible to determine
definitely where they are to be found.
But. knowing that there is something
somewhere in the cliffs, the exciting
search is begun. When a choice loca-
tion is found the explorer is rewarded,
otherwise his efforts have been futile.
But it is all a part of an interesting
adventure.”

Dr. Miller is now putting together
a skull and jaw of one of the fossils,

Rachmaninoff, Strauss, and Sibelius.
The rendition by the orchestra of the

By MARY JEAN ALDEN

We are told that the best way to keep up-to-the-minute in modern
fiction is to keep a little behind it. The person who breaks his neck (so
to speak) to read every well-advertised novel that comes out soon gets
dowdy in his literary conversation. The safe and sane way to travel is
to wait quietly and patiently until the best critics hate given you the cold
facts regarding which of the forty well-advertised novels are best. You
may have four on this list, maybe more, probably less.

The millennium has not yet arrived when all the novels heralded
in the fly leaves of The American Mercury are worth the paper they

MunicipalMiniature

Helped by Campus

are printed on. That day is yet a long
way off.

But out of the last batch of forty or

fifty novels
have been
critics:

the following seemed to
given the O. K. of the

From the shelf this week, we have
picked three recent novels, none of which
has attracted the interest which seems
its due. The three authors, P. C. Wren,
F. M. Ford, and James Stevens who are
already known in modern fiction have
presented three unusual themes, French
secret service, the late war, and woods-
men.

“A MAN COULD STAND UP”
“A Man Could Stand Up," the last of
a series of the late war stories written
by Ford Madox Ford, English critic and
novelist, refleflets the times in the most
effective manner of modern writers. This
very trite theme seemingly more and
more remote from the immediate prob-
lems of life, has been handled in a still
different way by the author.

It is a well-written exposition of the
war of attrition and portrays admira-
bly and not very bloodily, the undesir-
able mental reactions of modern scien-
tific warfare on the mind of a man in
action. If the purpose of the author
is to discourage the glory idea of war,
he has achieved it by the farcical rep-
resentations of the rag-time army dur-
ing “the eternal hours when Time it-
self stayed still as the true image of
bloody war.”

The successful unravelling of matri-
monial difficulties and a clandestine
love affair involving the hero and a
physiqal instructress who does not
know she is in love, brings in the nec-
essary appeal.

“BEAU SABREUR”

To the rather jaded reader who is
looking for something different in a
mystery story, “Beau Sabreur,” by P.
C. Wren comes as a welcome relief.
Those who read “Beau Geste” by the
same author need no introduction to
his plote woven around the French
Foreign Legion in northern Africa.

mainstay of the program. The other
music, charming and delectable as it
is, was purely incidental. Even Si-
belius’ tone poem, “Finlandia,” beauti-
ful and comparatively superficial, was
rendered superflous by contrast. Not
that 1 didn’t enjoy it—but after read-
ing Keats “The Cotter’s Saturday
Night” does seem a little light.

Glinka is charming, of course. Mr.
Evans, in his lecture preceding the
concert, mentioned the great deal of
color which the composer has con-
densed into remarkably simple music.
One can’t help liking Glinka, even aft-
er hearing the great masters of “ori-
ental” music — Rimsky-Korsakow,
Mussorgsky and Borodin.

Rachmaninoff’s Symphony

The Symphony, No. 2, in E Minor,
was Rachmaninoff’s contribution to
the program. Having never before
heard the Symphony, my reaction to
it was decidedly complicated. As a
whole, the number was long-drawn-
out, heavy, yet interspersed with bits
of sheer delight. The first movement,
although it gets nowhere in particu-
lar, is, as Mr. Mack Evans says, “a
beautiful tapestry of sound upon
which bits of colorful music are
thrown.” The harmony is rich but
overdone. Based almost entirely upon
a simple double-trill theme of four or
five notes, the symphony develop into
varying shades of rhythm and key; at
one time the trill theme grades into
an exciting and somewhat startling
crescendo. The clarinet solo in the
second movement was one of the most
beautiful I have ever heard. To sum-
marize, the Symphony |is one that
arouses a keen desire for further ac-
quaintance.

Concluding Music

The last two numbers seemed, after
the Rachmaninoff Symphony, a bit su-
perfluous. The orchestra and the audi-
ence were both too fatigued to ap-
preciate the imperious, victorious and
wearying Strauss “Intermezzo,” and
even the “Finlandia” tone poem by
Sibelius was uninspired. However, the
audience’s reaction to the last two
numbers was undoubtedly influenced
by the newness of the second selec-
tion, the Rachmaninoff Symphony.

Over,” the Theatre loses far more
than ever the producer and the prin-
ciples have to lose. That a fine lively
and amusing play could not have
been devised from .“Brewsters Mil-
lions” casts a slur, splashes a blot
on the ’scutcheon of dramatic art...
In some pieces it might be said that
the pjrinciples deter from the success
of it; such is not the case in “Bub-
bling Over.” Mr. Cecil Lean and
Miss Mayfield’s speech brings to the
stage something so out of the ordi-
nary, the common-place, that the au-
dience begins to smile with approval

one would think of Ted Lewis every
time one sees a high hat; think of
Frank L. Smith ever ytime one sees
a dollar bill. The vaudeville team of
Lean and Mayfield brought with them
several sketches and repartee dia-
logues from the circuit and bring
with the thanksgiving of the au-
dience. Rranker Woods, as the but-
ler, is a comic fellow you may have
seen in and about musical comedies
and if Mr. Woods finds an able tutor
and adviser you may see more of him.

The dancing team of Thalia Zanon
and Alberto de Lina, who do those
tangoes, Valencias et cetera made so
popularly notorious by the late Ital-
ian cinema luminary, add the one
other color of brilliance to the pro-
duction.

As an interpretation for the stage
of “Brewster’s Millions,” the piece
flops, as entertainment it flops and as
a good investment for those so inter-
ested, I am made to believe by its
sudden departure, is has disastrously
flopped. ,

By George Westerman

Chicago has been heralded as the
center of the so-called ‘ Little Theater
Movement.” This movement was cli-
maxed when the Kenneth Sawyer
Goodman theater was completed in
Grant Park. Students on the campus
have been turning more and more to
the little theater for entertainment. At
first it was mere curiosity that prompt-
ed this attention. The Bohemian sec-
tion of the city on the near north side
“s 1 u m m i n g” district harbors some
seven “hole-in-the-wall” stages. The
dramatic offerings of these miniature
playhouses have been free from the
blue pencil of the censor and outside
the scathing sarcasm of the critic. It
has been with an‘amused attitude that
students and people-about-town have
regarded these cock-pits of ham acting.

Chicago) is hailed as “the smart novel”
of the season. “Nigger Heaven”
(Knopf) takes its name from the sec-
tion of New York city where the
negro rules supreme, commonly known
as the Harlem. The lives and prob-
lems of the inhabitants are written
over the entire 284 pages. Hero and
heroine are so-called “new negroes”
which means that they are educated,
intelligent, yet sharing the emotions
of the race. The novel is by no means
confined to their strata but runs the
gamut from low to high life. The Yale
Review says it is “pointed, if not pro-
found.”

Twelve Year Old Child Shames
Collegians In Literary Criticisms

A few days ago in casually glancing
through a current number 'of Vanity
Fair I noticed the heading “A Child’s
Impressions of Lewis, Mencken, Cabell,
Arlen, and Others.” Remembering Bar-
ry and his enthusiasm for girl prodigy
of some years ago and, how terrible
the venture turned out, I stopped and
read the article expecting to be highly
amused. Instead I was first amazed and
then highly interested. I debated with
her on some points, acknowledged oth-
ers, and in fact read the article with as
much enjoyment and profit as would be
possible in reading any of the most rec-
ognized of literary critics writing for
our most intellectual magazines. I turned
back to the editor’s note at the beginning
of the article to reassure myself about
the child part. There in large print was
the statement that the girl was twelve
years old and that she was doing a series
of articles for the same publication.

I have read the majority of the cur-
rent book reviews that appear in the

great deal and are willing to talk about
what they have read. But never have I
heard of a person who has at the age
of twelve read with the voracity that
this young woman has, and, granting
that she could possibly read them, hav-
ing good eyesight and learned her let-
ters, I have never heard of a person that
has read with such intelligence at such

an uncanny age. Nor have I never heard
of very many who have read with such
intelligence at any age.

For example to quote “At the age of
nine I had head all of Dickens, Thack-
ery, Scott, and Shakespeare... .at ten
I had read Hary’s ‘Tess of the D’Uber-
villes’ and ‘Jude and Obscure,’ Butler’s
'The Way of All Flesh,’ a good deal
of Leonard Merrick whom I admired
tremendously, ‘The Captain’s Doll’ by D.
H. Lawrence, practically all of De Mau-
passant, Balzac and Dumas, much of
Flaubert, all of Ibsen’s plays, and the
current American and English novels.”
Qr “There seems to be a great dearth
of genius in America... .though there is
much talent—for we have Fannie Hurst,
Edna Ferber, Margaret Wilson, Carl
Van Vechten, Theodore Dreiser, Sin-
clair Lewis, Leonard Cline, Ruth Suck-
ow, Sherwood Anderson and others.”

These quotations but enumerate a few
of the things she has read. Then there
is her criticism: Cabell and occasionally
Fannie Hurst writing for sheer love of
beauty words, and ideas; Mencken, Lew-
is, Hecht and Van Vechten destruction-
ist with no building tendencies; Dos
Passos, bitter, lengthy, and incoherent.
These of course are but generalities and
we know little about them can say the
same but she does not stop there but
proceeds to analize each one carefully
and as though that were not enough

Within the last two years, however,
the status of the “little theater” has
been in a slow process of meamorpho-
sis. “The Little Theatre Monthly,” a
publication of some quality and char-
acter, has urged along the movement,
and, to some extent, legitimized it.

In a recent article entitled “The
Little Theatre—What It Is,” by Mr.
S. M. Tucker, he bemoans the fact that
current dramatic literature dealing
with the stage has entirely ignored
the movement. He cites the fact the
colleges and universities have launched
their dramatic societies in the “little
theatre” channels as a promising step
in the future of the little theatre.

Freer Than Commercial Stage

These unquenchable advocates of the
miniature stage seem to believe that
dramatics are given a freer, more nat-
ural opportunity to develop when not
commercialized and forced into the
stilted moulds formed by proletarian
demand.

In Chicago the best example of the
more-or-less Bohemian type of “little
theatre” is the Little Theatre Club at
1359 North Clark Street, The Duo-Art
theatre on Delaware 'street, the Radi-
cal Book Shop Repertory theatre,
and the orgiastic den of Jack Jones’
at the famous Dill Pickle Club. The
interest shown by curious campus men
and women have even led to a little
theatre at a place called The Grotto at

Cottage Grove and 57th. What
the next step be?

Bohemian Movements

According to Mr. Tucker, the

will

au-

thor of the aforementioned article, we
are about to witness a great develop-
ment of the amateur theatre. This, of
course, would be all to the good, as
even the professionals admit, that the
commercialized stage is rapidly “going
to the dogs.” And who, pray, will pick
up the torch when the big playhouses
downtown are completely given over
to burlesque shows (of a new sort)
if not the simple amateur?

rise from his tomb. The critics
there are a great many) seem to
on the fact that this book is

he to
(and
agree
Miss

Ferber’s best yet. It is full of spirited
humor, understanding, and sympathy.
It is not yet a best seller, but give it
time. Doubleday did a very neat and
attractive job with the make-up. The
cover jacket is especially attractive in
design.

Next on our list is Miss Sinclair’s
“Far End” (Macmillan). It is an at-
tempt at something new in which she
has left out a certain tone of reality in
her characters Because of this new
self-imposed style and objective Miss
Sinclair is said to lose the illuminating
parenthetic flashes which are an im-
portant part of her former novels.

Those three books seem to be the
three big books out of the recent batch
of novels. There are those unfortunate
novels that slink along on a rear by-»
ways unnoticed until the author is
either dead or too old to appreciate
the popularity when it does come. It
is with those novels that our theory
as to how to keep up-to-the-minute
goes weak. The busy American read-
er, as a rule, puts himself at the mercy
of the critics and the tastes of the book-
buying public. It is the college student
with his oft-heralded-little-experienced-’
hours-of-leisure who should wander
about on these remote byways in
search of the sheep that slip the fold
in the night.

This method of keeping up-to-the-
minute has been severely criticized by
those who advocate research and ob-
servation. They declare that such a

method
toward
velop a
what is

straight-jackets any tendency
observation. “We should de-
sense of what is good and
bad in literature. After all.

something which has been black-balled
by the stereotyped critical world may
be to you of the season’s best.” Our
system is for the college student who
has no time for much reading and yet
wishes to keep up-to-the-minute.

THE DAILY MAROON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1926

CRITIC INVENTS NEW
LITERARY ANALYTICS

It has been the desire of scientific,
furrowed-brow men of experimentation
to invent a formula which, when applied
to Katherine Mansfield’s “Miss Brill,”
will bring out in dazzling results the
characteristics in percentages and frac-
tion of Miss Mansfield’s style....

It lends itself not only to poetry but
also to prose and here the pattern goes
beyond all her predecessors had hoped
for. The methods, the patterns con-
trived by Miss Rickert have to do with
the Imagery, the Words, Thought Pat-
terns, Rhythm, Tone Patterns arid the
Visual Devices which comprise each and
every • poetry and prose selection.... If
at length each department were to be
elucidated and given to assiduous ex-
planation, another replica of the book
would be necessary. Miss Rickert, in
fine , has put her findings in concise
terminology, yet in such jargon to lie
understood by the most pragmatic pro-
letarian. In the laying on of the pat-
tern of Words, there are several meth-
ods of excavating the inner secrets of
the author’s style. Word proportion,
word length, extent of vocabulary, asso-
ciational values of words and phrasing
comprise the word mold. For example,
Miss Mansfield's excerpt is diagnosed
as to the proportion of different syllabic
lengths and to the succession of different
syllabic lengths. The result of a Miss
Mansfield’s investigation and survey of
even the most infinitestimal paragraph
will discern her individual style and if
when applied to an uncircumscribed ex-
cerpt showing the same results, the iden-
tity of the authorship of the doubted
excerpt may thus be ascribed to Miss
Mansfield.... In this manner books of
unknown or doubted authorship, as the
Shakespear and Marlow mooted plays,
can be definately conceded to the authen-
tic author... .Miss Rickert’s form is
likewise applicable to an investigation of,
say. the writings of William Sharp and
his nom de plume, “Fiona MasLeod”....

WINDOWS

A Sketch by Peter Pan

The dark street pursued it’s lazy way
through the canyon of brownstone hous-
es, and as I wandered aimlessly along,
I looked up at the windows and pondered
on what each hid behind it’s inscrutable
stare.

Here is a dark, cynical window, with
a crack like a twisted smile, and gray
cobwebs tracing fine wrinkles across it’s
sinister countenance. There will be in-
trigue behind that window—I thought—
a band of theives, murder, perhaps. 1
shuddered, and went on.

And here is a happy window, a fat
motherly one, with a complacent beam
on it’s face. There is peace behind that
one—I said—there will be a table laid
with a red and white checked cloth: and
there will be a tired laborer sitting down
to a bowl of steaming .soup—children,
probably—fat rosy cheeked children.

I mused for a time about the soup
and the children, and when at length I
looked up, I was opposite a tall angular
house whose descript shutters creaked
in the wind. From a jagged opening in
a lower shutter I caught the half
hearted gleam of a gas-jet. Ugh—I
thought—there will be poverty and sor-
didness. A window, perhaps, living
alone, or an old maid—On a sudden im-
pulse I crossed the street and rang the
bell.

The door swung open, and I con-
fronted a buxom woman tagged by two
rosy cheeked children, tongues in cheeks,
great eyes staring at me. The gas-jet
flickered in the sudden gust of wind—
my eyes went past it, down the hall.
At the far end, an overalled man was
rising to shut the door; I had a sudden
glimpse of a red and white checked
table — a steaming bowl—before he
slammed it shut with a word to the
woman before me to hurry.

Well—she queried—impatiently.

I beg your pardon—I stammered—I
have the wrong house. And as I went
down the stairs—sentimental fool—I
thought—and aloud—sentimental fool A
small breeze caught the words, and
flung them at the windows.

Sentimental fool—they echoed.

I went on, through the canyon of in-
scrutable windows.

OFF THE SHELF

(Continued from page 3)

Mr. Wren writes in the first person
and though tragedy hovers over every
page, there is a humorous vein run-
ning throughout the story which keeps
the reader fairly breathless.

The vivid mystery which holds
“Beau Sabreur” steadfast to his pur-
pose, even though he is required to
sacrifice love and honor, makes the
reader, unless he is especially clever,
entirely unaware of the big joke that
is being played upon him, which is un-
covered in the second part of the book,
and makes him rather ashamed of his
intense feelings on the subject. One
doesn’t know whether or not he likes
the character, “Beau Sabreur,” but
at least he is interested.

“BRAWNYMAN”

James Stevens, hobo-worker, team-
ster, lumberman, aurhor of “Paul Bun-
yan,” and the foremost literary author-
ity on the delightful stories of the
woo dsmen, has in “Brawnyman” writ-
ten a vivid and interesting account of
his lively and colorful life. This man
Stevens can write, and he does it with
all the gusto and fire that character-
izes the life he has led. What he has
written is new and delightful, and his
Paddy the Devil, Red Grabby, and
Gager are enjoyable characters.
