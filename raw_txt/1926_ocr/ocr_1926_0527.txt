“Show the boys they are welcome
by decorating your house,” said
Fred Von Ammon, chairman of the
publicity committee of the Inter-
scholastic. The deadline for decora-
tions is set for Thursday evening,
June 2. AD fraternities are request-
ed to decorate and those on Wood-
' lawn and University Avenues are
urged to make a special effort on
decorations.

On the evening before the meet
opens a committee composed of the
"Old Man,” Fritz Crisler, Tom Mul-
roy, and a disinterested party will
go around to all of the fraternities
and at that time will judge which
house has the most attractive decor-
ations. When judging, the men will
take into consideration such factors
as attractiveness, elaborateness, and
amount of work done, neatness and
appearance in general.

Cup Is Prize

The Judges will award a first prize
to the house which ranks highest in
their estimation and will also give
honorable mention to those which
they think are deserving of credit.

The prize is a large silver loving
cup. It is given each year and is

Did you notice that very digni-
fied group of men wandering
around the campus Tuesday?
Somewhat reminiscent of a dele-
gation from the Waiter’s Union
visiting the campus on official busi-
ness, they all wore full dress—
not tuxedoes but full dress, white
vests and ties, tail coats, and ev-
erything. It was a hot, bright af-
ternoon so that the peculiar effect
caused by their clothes was great-
ly accentuated.

The gentlemen were obviously
not freshmen. That could easily
be seen, for never did freshmen
wear such serious and benign ex-
pressions But no one not being
initiated into some Grand Order
or other could possibly wear such
clothes. And then again, it’s spring
time ....

Who is initiating now anyway?

Alumni have recently been sent in-

of the corner stone of the University
Chapel, East Fifty-ninth street at
Woodlawn avenue, Friday, June 11,

literary editor of the Chicago Even-
ing Post, in a talk to Frank O’Hara’s
newswriting class yesterday.

“Be sincere and art will take care
of itself,” he continued. “It is art
that gives coherence the experiences
of our daily life. We crave puretic
experience. We have very few of
those. Contingent factors always en-
ter in. If you see an actual killing
in the street you have an unpleasant
reaction. A tragedy on the stage is
not revolting because you unders-
tand the causes leading up to it.

“Young poets say that they are
getting away from form slavery. But
forms were not set up by some super
aesthete and poetry poured into
them. They grew up gradually. They
are patterns. The most complex work
of art is that in which opposing ex-
periences are expressed in one form.
A great poet does not look upon an
experience from one level of percep-
tion. Beauty itself is a word we
must steer clear of. Aesthetes have
given it sixteen differen meanings.”

FOR CLASS GIFT

Seniors Collect $8,532; Many
Will Contribute Today
In Chapel

Eight thousand, five hundred and
thirty-two dollars’ have so far been
collected by the Senior class Council
towards the purchase of the class gift
to the University. This sum comes
from 185 seniors.

Those who have not yet p^ ed j
will be asked to do so in chapel to-
day, as the month given the members
of the class to decide on the amount
they will contribute individually is
now up. Allan Miller, president of
the class, hopes and expects to raise
$20,000. This sum will enable the
class to carry out their plans quite
comfortably.

Alumnus Speaks

William France Anderson, a prom-
inent alumnus of the University, is
to speak to the seniors in chapel to-
day on the purpose of the graduating
class annual gift to the University.
Mr. Anderson graduated from the
University in 1915. He has since
been engaged in business.

The fund the seniors are to raise
will not be completely collected to-

THE LAST LAP VETERAN COACH

Tom Eck, veteran trainer of Ma-
roon track teams for eleven years,
who lies in a very serious condition
at the West Side Infirmary. Mr.
Eck came to the University in 1915
with a score of laurels attached to his
name. Since then he has been a
friend and inspiration to hundreds of
Chicago athletes.

Tom Eck is losing his last race.
This word reached the University
last night from the County hospital
where the veteran trainer has been
sinking steadily for over a week. He
was removed to the West Side infirm-
ary last Monday after four weeks of
suffering at his home near the cam-
pus.

“Mr. Eck is sinking fast,” an of-
ficial statement from Dr. K. B. No-
vak reveals. “A multitude of internal
disorders, heart trouble, kidney
trouble, have undermined his consti-
tution. He is an old man and science
can do little. At best we do not ex-
pect him to live more than two
weeks.”

of Stagg in their front yard. They
also had the words “World’s Great-
est Interscholastic” spelt out with
white bricks on the lawn. Other
fraternities decorated their houses
with streamers, banners, posters and
statues of appropriate types.

Decorations Have Purpose

The decorations will show the boys
who come to compete in the Inter-
scholastic that the University is glad
to have. them. They will feel that
the University is a wonderful school
to welcome them in a royal fashion
and when they are thinking about a
school to attend they will remember
the way they were treated at the In-
terscholastic.

VISITING PROFESSOR
RETURNS TO BRITAIN
FOR HISTORY WORK

Godfrey Davies, assistant profes-
sor of history at Oxford University,
who has been giving courses in Brit-
ish history at the University during
the past year, will spend the sum-
mer quarter in England. He is plan-
ning to finish compiling a bibliogra-
phy on British history from 1603 to
1714 for the Royal historical society
and the American Historical society.

Mr. Davies will go directly to his
home in Sirincester after arriving in
London on the steamship *Triscona”.
Though it has a population of only
7,000 now, Sirincester is one of the
three largest cities in Britany dur-
ing medieval times. Mr. Davies will
spend his entire time in this town
with the exception of several trips to
Oxford when his work demands it.
He will return to the campus at the
end of September in company with
Mr. W. L. Dorn, instructor in history
who is also spending his summer
months abroad.

Dr. Conyers Read, visiting profes-
sor of history of the University,
who came to the campus on a lecture
tour last winter is working on an-
other part of the bibliography for
the American and British historical
enriotipu

Frank Lloyd Wright, world-famous
architect, spent many months in de-
signing the structure. The chapel,
he contended, should be the para-
mount building on the campus. Above
physical and chemical laboratories,
ab ve sociological and psychological
experiment buildings, above class
rooms and libraries the University'
Chapel should tower aloft, awe-in-
spiring and over-powering.

In persuance of this ideal he spent
a great deal of time abroad studying
various styles of famous architecture.
Returning to this country he shut
himself in his room and combined
the distinguishing effects of each.

President Max Mason, in issuing
the invitations, felt that Alumni
Week would be the appropriate time
for the ceremony. Many classes are
planning to hold reunions during that
week, and the dedication will be an
added incentive for the old grads
to revisit the campus.

To the campus at large the rugged
countenance and tousled white head
have formed a noble character, an
integral part of University life. TA
the hundreds of athletes whom he
has molded “Tom” has been more
than a trainer of iron-clad standards,
he has been a friend, an inspiration.

The “dean of all trainers” was
born April 10, 1856, in Prince Al-
bert, Ontario. During his youth he
was a noted horseman, ice-skater,
cricket and lacrosse player, and also
developed into a “world’s record
class” all-around athlete, setting rec-
ords in walking, bicycling and sev-
eral track and fie’d events. He held
the world’s record for the standing
broad jump and high-wheel bicycle
riding.

Into the making of this one cigarette goes all of the ability

Nothing is too good for Camels. The choicest Turkish and

scientific package. No other cigarette made is like Camels.
No better cigarette can be made. Camels are the overwhelm*

Play in Heavy Downpour
As Errors Pile

Up

By Tom Stephenson

The Nus have it Sigma Nu and
Kappa Nu swam and paddled their
way through a terrific downpour of
rain yesterday afternoon to win the
semi-final contests of the I-M Play-
ground Ball Tourney. Sigma Nu
eliminated Alpha Delta Phi, 5 to 2.
Kappa Nu .defeated the Senator^
8 to 4.

In Big Ten Circles it is customary
to cal! off the ball games in rainy
weather, but not so with the I-M
games yesterday—they were too im-j
portant. It was wonderful weather
for base-sliding, but not so good for
batting—the bats flew with the mud.
In spite cf difficulties the winning
pitchers, Bus Stevens and Klaff,
hurled championship ball —airtight
and waterproof.- -

Widman brought in Percy for the
initial Sig Nu counter, when Covert
muffed the slippery pill. This was
in the third inning, and with the
playing conditions getting worse it
looked as if it would win the game.
However, clean hitting by Stevens,
Hoey, and Ecklund brought three
more Sig Nu runs in the sixth inning.
The Alpha Delts staged a whirlpool
comeback in the seventh, but stellar
work by the Sigma Nu support
drowned Alpha Delt hopes.

Klaff, Kappa Nu hurler, won his
own game with a beautiful home run
in the sixth, bringing in two runs and
breaking a 4 to 4 tie. Up to this
time the battle had been seasawy.

runs apiece.

■Field In Perfect
Shape For 1926

Track Festival

Despite adverse weather conditions
the track for the Intramural Festival
preliminaries, which will be held this
afternoon at 3:30, will be in excellent
condition. Jimmy Twohig, veteran
groundkeeper, has spared no efforts
to get the track in shape and the re-
sult is that the times of the various
events should be fast.

According to Bill Weddell, man-
ager of the meet, the competition
that is in store for the field will bring
plenty of speed out of the aspirants.
“Seven Intramural track champions
in various events will face the start-
er’s gun this afternoon,’’ said Wed-
dell. “In every event the calibre of
the contestants promises exciting
races with subsequently good marks
in each event.’’

Some of the favorites for this af-
ternoon’s affair are as follows: Blan-
kenstein of Phi Beta Delta, winner
of the running broad jump in last
spring’s meet; Faris of Delta Sigma
Phi, winner of the mile run last year;
Gene Francis of Alpha Delta Phi,
winner of the low hurdles in the in-
door carnival; and Bob Laverty of
Phi Kappa Psi, Carnival champion in
the 50 yard dash.

Plenty of competition, however,
will face these favorites in the meet.
Peale of the Phi Psi stronghold
should give Francis a stiff battle in
the hurdles and Chuck Gaskill of Del-
ta Sigma Phi will be a hot contender
in the dashes. Jim Griffin, who also
hails from the Delta Sig house, is
a likely winner in the high jump.
A great ‘hree cornered race in the
relay between Alpha Delt, Phi Psi,
and Delta Sig is anticipated.

Saturday; Play

Begins

Although the drawings were not
completed last night it is expected
that play in the Conference Tennis
Tournament will get underway at 10
o’clock this a. m. It will continue
through tomorrow and Saturday when
the finals will be staged on the courts
just east of the circle. Indiana will
be the only Big Ten school not hav-
ing any representatives entering.

There are few’ outstanding racket
men in the conference this year al-
though a number could be classified
as “first rate,” and for that reason
the title matches should be merrily
contested even though the playing-
will not be of the highest quality.

The absence of George Lott will
force Chicago backers to lay their
hopes on the efforts of Shapinsky
and Captain Schaefer both in the
singles and doubles. Schaefer lacks
the consistency of a tournament win-
ner, but Shapinsky with an overshare
of the breaks should get somewhere.

MAROON BALLMEN WHITEWASHED
BY ILUNI IN RETURN CONTEST AT

URBANA; MIDWAYITES GO HTTLESS

Norgren Uses Two Hurlers in Vain Attempt to Stem Strong
Illini Attack; Lose By
13-0 Count

By Harry L. Shlaes

Urbana, Ill., May 26. (Special
to the Daily Maroon)

With Ludlan on the mound for the
Indians and hurling wonderful ball,
the home team turned back the Ma-
roon stockinged invadors, 13-0 to
whitewash their former victors in
the return game here this afternoon.
The Maroons were held hitless
throughout the contest, only six er-
rors, four by Ludlan himself and
two by Shimm, Illini shortstop,
marred the otherwise perfect tilt,
although two bases on balls were
handed the visitors.

Ludlan Baffles Maroons

While the Maroons were struggling
vainly with the perfect hurling of
the winners, the Illini were busy
knocking two Midway pitchers, Mak-
lind and Zimmerman, off the mound
to count seventeen safe blows and
thirteen runs. They started out with
three in the first after putting their
opponents down in one-two-three or-
der and counted six more in the fifth,
three in the seventh and one in the
eighth.

The feature of the contest was
the home run made by O’Keefe in
the fifth frame. Besides, he added a
double to center to fatten his bat-
ting average. Shimm and Kusinski
also knocked out two baggers during
the process of the game. The Illini
seventeen hits were intermixed with
six bases on balls handed them by
the Norgren hurlers and contributed
in no little way to the thirteen coun-
ters scored by the Urbanans in their
eight times at bat.

The visitors threatened to count

several times through the many er-
rors which the Indian infield made,
but Ludlan tightened up in the
pinches enough to stop them from
scoring. Major, Illini center fielder,
starred at bat with three singles
for the day’s work, while almost
everyone else hit at least once.

Only four games remain on the
Maroon schedule for this season.
They are well out of the running for
the Big Ten title but still may un-
cork a few surprises before the end
of the year. Their next game is
carded for tomorrow afternoon with
Ohio State, at Columbus.
