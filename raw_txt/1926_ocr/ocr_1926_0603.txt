Be at the big all-University pep ses-

them! Such is the call that conies
from Thomas Mulroy, manager of the

eve of the annual classic approaches.

Tonight at 6:45, the University band
will start from Mandel at the head of
a snake dance down University ave-
nue to Fifty-Sixth street, back Wood-
lawn to the Midway, and then about
the women’s dorms and the men’s

Eck Kept Alive

State Physicians

“Tom Eck would have been dead
two weeks ago if he didn’t have the
constitution of a superman.”

This statement made early today by
Dr. K. B. Novak of the County Hos-
pital reveals the dying trainer’s actual
condition—that he is hanging on by a
thread. “Mr. Eck will never see an-
other Sunday, of this I am quite cer-

now existing on the very elements of
his marvelous constitution which has
borne him along in greater shape than
I have ever before seen. By all physi-
cal laws he should have been a dead
man long ago, but his years of train-

the Illinois Proportional Representa-

The students who participated in the
balloting were each asked to vote twice
—once on the question of whether or
no they were satisfied with the law and
if so what changes they suggested,
and secondly—whom would they pick
from a printed list of candidates to
serve on a theoretical commission to
change the law.

According to Prof. Mott, the results

w’ho had voted wet on the first bal-
lot voted dry on the second, and vice
versa. In general, the men selected
for the mythical commission were of
knowm integrity and ability with little
definite opinion about the law. Two
prominent wrets—Al Smith of New
York and Clarence Darrow—were
elected, and also two prominent dries
—Jane Addams and Andrew Volstead.

summer conference discussion of cur-
rent race problems from June 24 to
27 at the Bowen country club, Wau-

Speakers at the conference will in-

department, Prof. N. Haydon of the
Philosophy department, Clarence Dar-

A prize examination on the Ameri-
can Government will be conducted by
the department of Political Science,
Saturday at 10 in Harper M-15. Two
cash prizes have been offered to the
contestants, a first prize of $150 and a
second prize of $50. In additiq*, the
names of both winners will be pub-
lished on the convocation program.

The examination will test the con-
testant's general knowledge on Amer-
ican government and will cover all
branches of the government. It is open
to all students of the University who
have at least three majors credit and
not more than nine majors credit in
the Recorder’s office. Registration in a
Political Science class is not essential.
Any one wishing to compete should
communicate with Dr. R. L. Mott,
who is in charge of the cofitest, in Har-

Forty-nine graduating seniors from
high schools in Chicago and adjacent
cities won prize scholarships in ex-
aminations given by the University.
Four hundred and one students from
the Senior classes of schools cooper-
ating with the Universitj’ competed in
the examinations. Awards consisted
of scholarships representing full tui-
tion, one-half tuition, or one-third tui-
tion for three quarters of work taken
at the University.

The examinations were given in the
subjects of American history, Botany,
Chemistry, English, French, Latin,
Mathematics, Physics and Spanish,
English and American History were
the subjects favored and more schol-
arships were given in thes fields than
in any of the other.

The number of awards to be given
during the current year has been more
than doubtful. At least one full
scholarship is granted in each depart-
ment and several partial scholarships.

to awarding the chevrons, plans for
the new W .A. A. lodge, which the or-

be on sale at the meeting for one

would like to see just as many wom-
