^TEAM FIGHTS ALONE-DECISION

In a recent visit to Evanston, I was
acquainted with a fellow who, it
seemed to me, was potentially danger-
ous, unless he were curbed. “It is all
right,” he said, “to make merry over
the Spirit of Rotary, to make the name
of Bruce Barton a hissing and a by-
word. It is all right, I say, to do this.
There is no law against it, the gen-
darmes will not run you to cover if
you do it. There is, in fact, not the
slightest reason why you shouldn’t do
it. provided you WANT to. But no
man who really thinks the thing out
logical!? wants to.

You admit it, as I do. Only you will

Now on a tour of the United
States and Canada, the Rt. Reverend
A. F. Winnington Ingram, D. D.,
Bishop of London, will visit the Uni-
versity as the guest of the St. Marks
Society on October 6. A complete
program has been planned for the
day, consisting of a tour of the city,
a visit to Dean Matthews, a public
lecture by the bishop, and a dinner
in his honor in Ida Noyes hall.

Clergy Presnet

Bishop Griswold of the Episcopal
church will represent the clergy at
the dinner, while the faculty mem-

Bishop Ingram will arrive in the

Sixteen eminent scientists from the
University have cooperated in what
is considered one of the most unique
programs of public education ever at-
tempted. In a volume of almost 600
pages published by the University
Press and a senes of lectures at the
Art Institute open to the public, these
scholars have told the story of man’s
ancestry, or the earth before he ar-
rived, of the germs that menace his
existence, of the processes by which
he lives, and of his mental develop-
ment—in short the story of “the na-
ture of the world and of man.’’

The men contributing to the enter-
prise are nationally known figures in

the “Green” number next Thursday,
according to an announcement made
yesterday by John Allison, editor.

That Freshmen will find it rich in
superfluous advice and abounding in
intimate details of campus life, comes
as a definite assurance from the edit-
ors of the publication. Besides serv-
ing as an introduction to campus
literati for the neophytes, Allison sug-
gets that upperclassmen will learn
things about the University, the ex-
istence of which has been unsuspected.

Artists and humorists in the Fresh-
man class interested in staff positions
with The Phoenix should be pres-
ent at the meeting at 1:30 this after-
noon in The Daily Maroon office in

SCHOLZ ANNOUNCES
MEETING OF YEAR
BOOK SOPHOMORES

With a huge informal'get-to-geth-
er party sponsored by the Board of
Women’s Organizations, tomorrow
evening in the main gymnasium of
Ida Noyes hall, entering women will
see the close of Freshman week. The
affair will begin at 7:30 and continue
make the party informal, according
until 9:30.

Every means will be taken to
to Harriett Keeney, chairman of the
Board of Women’s Organizations.
Community singing of University
songs will be led by Mrs. Charles
Robbins who has often conducted the
gymnasium classes in singing games.
Clyde Keutzer, leading lady in the
recent Blackfriars’ production, will
accompany the singing at the piano.

Get-to-gether games will be under
the supervision of Beatrice Nesbit.
“Freshmen women are urged to at-
tend this final gathering in order to
become acquainted with the women
of the class of ’30,” said Miss Keen-
ey. “The Board of Women’s Organ-
izations will do its utmost to make
the affair a success.”

A request

was made for the frat-

ernities to keep the ground about their
houses in as neat condition as possible.

The first discussion of the annual
terfraternity Ball was held.

President Jim Cusack conducted

Handschy Knows
the Low-Down on

High Hat Mania

There was a time last year when
Fred Handsechy was editor of The
Phoenix that he selected the most
beautiful girl, on campus, to grace the
cover of his magazine. And running
true to form Fred is now helping all

women

eyes of

to become attractive in the
men.

The reason why this man seemed so
terriby dangerous to me was because
he could see things as they were, he
could recognize that the Lions, Ro-
tary, Kiwanis, the Optimists were
forces calculated to ruin the founda-
tions of idealism in this country, if
any. Any man, who, like Barton is an
advertisement for the next serial in-
stallment of “The Man Nobody
Knows,” could advertise, “Tomorrow:
How Jesus used a recognized princi-
ple of modern business—getting in step
with your prospect—to win his audi-
ences,” is a genuine menace to the
life of the nation.

Sophomore editors of the Cap and
Gown will meet at 2:30 o’clock Mon-
day afternoon in the Cap and Gown
office according to an announcement
made yesterday by Richard Scholz,
editor.

Scholz plans to get work under way
immediately for this year’s book. He
urges* Freshman candidates to come
out Wednesday and tryout for jobs
on the staff.

Freshmen intending to compete for
positions will attend the publications
meeting today at 1:30 in Ellis hall.

HEALD RETURNS FOR
HELLENISTIC STUDY

MIRROR MANUSCRIPT
DEADUNE DATE SET

FOR FRIDAY, OCT. 15

All this unwonted seriousness is for
a definite end. It is to curb the cam-
pus Kiwanian (insincere variety, as
my acquaintance was)—that odd duck
who uses, for instance, the Y. M. C.
A. Cabinet as a step to higher and
better (and more lucrative things). He
has what simple souls call “good
talks” on such subjects as heaven and
hell in his discussion group, and when
he has got to be something through
the Y. M. C. A., he deserts it ignobly.
Of course, if he stayed on, he’d be
worse than a menace—he’d be an eni-
gma. But that is something else
again.

Not content with four years of
scholarly colegiatism, Allen Heald, for-
mer student head marshal, has ex-
pressed his definite intention of return-
ing to the quadrangles. Such an ex-
pression from Heald is, in view of

Deadline for Mirror manuscripts has
been set for Friday, Oct. 15 by Elizabeth
Graham, president of the organization.
This early date has been selected be-
cause work on the second annual Mirror
production, which will be given during
the Winter Quarter, must be started
early this quarter, according to Miss
Graham. Manuscripts should be sub-
mitted in as complete form as possible.
The manuscript committee which con-
sists of Margaret Carr, Elizabeth Mur-
vai, Isabelle Bates, Dorothy Lowe and
Ruth DeWitt, will meet Wednesday at
4 in Ida Noyes hall.

Y. W. Advisory

Board Meets Monday

his deliberate, not to say
manner, a thing of no small

ance.

The editor of last year’s

dilatory
import-

Maroon

is to return to his study of Greek, a
dead language in which he evidences
a lively interest, to such an extent
that it gained for him not only that
rare degree, Bachelor of Arts, but
that so much coveted honor, a mem-
bership in Phi Beta Kappa.

Y. W. C. A. Advisory Board will
meet Monday at 4 in the Y. W. room
of Ida Noyes hall to plan the work
of the organization for the year. The
Advisory board which is made up of
women members of the faculty and the
University community co-operates each
year with the Y. W. C. A. cabinet and
the eleven sub-committees in making a
program of the work for the year and
helping to carry it out.

Fred is advertising.

And he is advertising women’s hats.
He spends his time writing histories
for the chic creations of Gage Broth-
ers. His experience in writing on the
campus humorous publication is said
to stand him in god stead in his new
position as advertising manager.

Of all the rumors that circled the
campus as to Fred’s destiny few men-
tioned advertising; most said the stage

or writing. All that Fred has to
is “It’s hotsy!’’

say

KREINES CALLS FOR
AMBITIOUS FROSH

Numerous positions are open for
wide-awake Freshmen on the business
department of The Daily Maroon, ac-
cording to a statement by Milton
Kerines yesterday. Applicants are
asked to attend the publications meet-
ing today at 1:30 in Ellis hall. In ad-
dition a meeting of those especially
interested in the advertising depart-
ment will be held Monday at 2:30 in
the office.

At least twenty-five applicants will
be able to secure positions that will
not only afford them with interesting
recreation, but will also prove to be
financially remunerative. Experience
will not be necessary as the work will
be fully explained by the managers
of the various departments.

For all Freshmen who desire to try
out for the Green Cap club, the first
of a series of four weekly luncheons
will be held Monday noon, at the Dis-
ciples of Christ Church, 57th and Uni-
versity Avenue. For the luncheon
there are available only one hundred
and forty tickets, which can be pur-
chased either from fraternity repre-
sentatives or at the candy booth in the
Reynolds club.

President Max Mason will speak at
the luncheon. There will also be mu-
sical specialties and comedy numbers.
| The duties of the club and its organ-
। izations will be explained.

Freshmen, who are desirous of mak-
ing the club, are reminded that it is
essential to attend every luncheon.
Those missing any of these noonday
gatherings will not be considered for
membership.

The luncheon, Monday, marks the
beginning of thd probation period,
which will end at the time of the Wis-
consin football game, when those
.making the Green Cap club will pre-
sent their annual stunt.

FEDERATION HOLDS
TEA, OPEN-MEETING

FOR FROSH WOMEN

Federation will sponsor a tea for
entering women students and their
councillors today from 5 to 6, follow-
ing a talk by Mrs. Edith Foster Flint
on “Campus Activities Open to Wom-

en.

The tea offers another opportun-

ity to Freshmen women to become ac-
quainted with each other.

“Aims and Ideals of Federation’’
will be the subject of discussion at
the first open council meeting of the
quarter, to be held Tuesday evening
from 7 to 8 in the library of Ida Noyes
hall. Each member of the council
will give a short talk on her specific
duties, and will amplify on the func-
tions of Federation.

Seek Whereabouts of
Edward Montgomery

An urgent message from home for
Edward Montgomery of Fairfield, Iowa,
has been received at the Examiner’s Of-
fice. Any information as to his where-
abouts would be appreciated, as he has
not yet been located.

there will be no horde of Maroon sup-
porters to send their champions into
the battle on Franklin Field.

This has been decided by Vice-
president Frederick C. Woodward and
Dean Chauncey S. Boucher who an-
nounced today that they intend to up-
hold the plea made by Coach Yost of
Michigan and others at the Big Ten
faculty conference last spring to dis-
courage the migration of students to
the big games. While the adminis-
tration has as yet taken no official ac-
tion, a statement of policy is expected
from Mr. Woodward within the next
few days.

Woodward Cites Policy

“It has always been the policy of
not only the University of Chicago
but of the Big Ten universities to dis-
t courage student migration of this
sort,’’ declared the vice-president to-
day. “The administration will decide
within the week just what official ac-
tion is to be taken, if any.”

“It is common knowledge that
movement of student bodies to foot-
ball games results in a riot of drinking
and gambling,” Dean Boucher ex-
plained. “This is true on the Uni-
versity of Chicago campus and we
would be hypocrites to say that Chi-
cago men act any better when they are
the visitors.

Boucher Speaks of Morals

“But drinking is not the sole evil of
these excursions. They are a paradise
for the gamblers, and even those who
neither drink nor gamble spend be-
yond their means. The expense of an
out-of-town game is one luxury that
is not intrinsic to a college education.

“Still another point that favors our
stand is the possibility of accidents in
collegiate flivvers. Year by year the
risky sport of Fording it gains pop-
ularity among college men, and the
number of accidents to which it leads
are too portentious to be overlooked.

Discourages Raucas Celebration

“It is our hope,” concluded Mr.
Boucher, “that the only railroad ex-
cursions to the Pennsylvania game will
be for alumni and friends of the uni-
versity, and that any celebrations of
enthusiasm or victory that may occur
will cast no reflection on the student
body.”

Frank Hurburt O’Hara, director of
student activities, had no comment to
make except that he has always known ■
the policy of the university to discour-

According to an academic interpre-
tation of the project, the purpose is
“to present an outline of our knowl-
edge of the psysical and biological
world, and to show the position of man
in the universe in which he lives. Or
in more personal terms it aims to
assist the individual in the very im-
portant problem of forming well-de-
fined conceptions of the Cosmos and
of his relation to it.”

Heretofore the series of lectures has
been open only to a selected group of
students at the University. It was so
enthusiastically received by the stu-
dents, that plans were immediately
formulated by the University to make
wider and more effective use df the
material. The publication of the book
and the presentation of the lectures
at the Art Institute starting October
8 are the result of these plans.

“The authors have not treated sci-
ence as something cold and austere

ment from the University concludes.
“On the contrary it glows with the
burning enthusiasm of those who have
cultivated it; it is severe only in the
standards of truth that it maintains;
and it has aesthetic aspects as well as
practical There will be no hesitation
in pointing out the present great value

the future.”

“MAROON LUNCH” ON A WARM
DAY	-

By Jonquil Stephens

In England now, the bluebells sway
Blown by the breeze this way, that
way

In the quiet depths of a copse I
Know. And the mayflower drops
Where daisies hide down in the grass
And cowslips grow there by the mass;
The violets breathe and die and fade
And no one knows. In that green
glade

Pan goes fluting and glow-worms
hide

The bees go calling high and wide.
Far in the deep and quiet pool
The lilies float so white and cool;
Sometimes a lark comes singing by
Then fades far off into the sky,
For silence is for ever there
And only beauty in the air.

Cool grey dawn and quiet noon!
The long white fingers of the moon!

“My God! this cafeteria smells of
stew!

And the damned flies stick all over
you”

By Bee Jay Green

Blossoming through the chilling
rains which daily dampen Cobb Hall
comes now Jonquil Stephens. Jon-
quil Stephens, English poetess, pros-
pective novelist, a new comer on the
campus.

Miss Stephens is a clerk in the
University Examiner’s Office, but
when she is not in the office her
thoughts turn to England, and in
poetic terms they bring memories of
bluebells and cowslips.

“Here,” sl^ complains, “you de-
mand that a temperamental person
produce first the work of a hack
writer before he can command atten-
tion to his real work. In England we
do not demand that, one may be tem-
peramental there.”

Miss Stephens has written for the
British American newspaper and the
Sunday Chronicle in England. Most
of her work appeared when she was
scarcely fifteen. Since then she has
travelled all over the world, spending
several years visiting different parts
of the British Isles. Her advent into
University of Chicago life came
when instead of continuing on/to
Mevico as she had planned, she
stopped here during the summer, re-
ceived a position in the Examiner’s
office and decided to go to school.

Miss Stephens’ work will be done
largely in English courses in order
that she may be aided towards the
completion of a novel about Univer-1
sity people.

ON ACTIVITIES

TT'OR this one week of the school year the editors of The Daily Ma-
x roon, together with all other upper classmen, become dispensers
of confidential information and mature advice. They repress the
flood of protests which rise to their minds every afternoon at 2
o’clock; they courageously brush aside all the controversial material
which clutters up their desks; and they lay aside the battle-ax of logic
and the scimitar of wit, with which they are accustomed to bludgeon
their opponents. They come out from their editorial fortresses, and
leaning patronizingly over the figurative shoulders of the new fresh-
man class, they whisper to them the inside dope on campus activities.

This is our advice:

We urge you to try out for some campus activity. You are
the best judge of whether or not you have the time for any extra-
curricular activity. You are also the best judge of whether or not
you are temperamentally suited for participation in these activities.
You know now, and have known for a long time, whether or not you
are the type of person who might get something of interest ot of
profit from such participation. If you know yourself well enough
to be convinced that it is a waste of time, by all means stay away
from it. But if you feel that you are interested in participation, or
might become interested, we exhort you to give activities a trial.

You have listened to discussions of the various types of campus
activity. You have been urged to enter into a dozen different ac-
tivities. We caution you to first investigate them all. Most of you
know now which activity is most suited to your temperament. But
there are other factors which must be considered. Find out what
kind of people are managing each activity, find out just how much
work you will be expected to do, how much time your work will
take, how many friends you will make, what rewards, tangible and
intangible, you may expect from your work. Then, after you have
seen and heard what there is to see and hear about each of the
activities which interests you, and after due thought and prayer,
choose the one which you think will help you most. Participation in
more than one activity is dangerous to scholarship, interest, work
manship, health and accomplishment. Stick to one.

Do not feel that you are too amateur or too inexperienced for
any activity on the campus. Any publication, any club, any athletic
team in school is not too good for you if you are willing to work.
Go to the editor, the president, the manager or the coach, and de-
clare yourself a candidate. Then stick to it. Once you have started
keep working at it. For the first few weeks you will be ordered
about preemptorily one half of the time, and totally neglected the
other half. But if you keep working you will soon be definitely es-
tablished as a part of your activity, and your path will be considered
smoother.

Do not work too hard. If you take responsibility well the edi-
tors and managers will work you so hard that you will be discour-
aged, your class work will suffer and you will drop out after three
weeks.

Activities, we believe, are valuable. We urge you to be active,
to work moderately but steadily, and to take advantage of all the
good things which go with it.

The various pieces of entertainment
now on view in the playhouses of our
Rialto have met with varied reception.
Drama of sterner stuff, of thesis and
theme, of edifying and enlightening
“idea” go the road of short rejection—
they gasp- in the stuffy, sooty ozone of
the loop and give up a ghost which
may be esteemed and heralded in liter-
ature or the Little Theatre, but which
turns the shopgirls and shipping clerk's
maw and leaves the boxoffice deserted
and the seats cold and damp. Plays of
comedy, of audacity, of sex flourish, nd
revues gather the multitude in the Tun-
ney-Dempsey fashion. They amuse and
do not require the furrowing of brows,
both low and high.

“The Poor Nut”

Elliott Nugent comes to the Cort in a
play of college life, of the poor, infer-
iority complexed simpleton, who knows
deep in his heart that, he “can’t” . . .
But he does finally and the audience
screams its approval . . . The manage-
ment of the Cort has caused to be flown
pennants and banners of the Big Ten
schools and the players try hard and
succeed uncannily in being ‘college.”

“Gentleman Prefer Blondes”

What seems to most people as roaring
comedy of young women of adventure in
action, appears to the management as
just another play and they have conse-
quently spoiled it by too many substitu-
tions. . . The play is still good entertain-

from a European triumph, Lester Allen
and silk hat Ted Lewis give untif it hurts
of good, fast entertainment and the pub-
lic who have packed the Woods every
night since the tuxedo performance de-
mand twelve encores from the Mary
Garden of jazz and four extra numbers
from the Crown Prince of Jazz.

The “Variety” (theatrical weekly)
headlines in .two inch type that “Biz Is
Off In Chicago” and the best indication
is the announcement of eight withdraw-
als from the loop theaters. ‘The Great
Gatsby” is the only show, with the pos-
sible exception of “Black Velvet" which
goes lamented and escorted to the Cen-
tury with lilies and violets. James Ren-
nie performed admirably in the Fitz-
gerald play and if Mrs. Insult had been
more pragmatically motivated, perhaps
Mr. Rennie would stay on several more
weeks. But the silver lining of Mrs.
Insull’s management may best be ap-
preciated from our campus. The Stude-
baker will soon announce the production
of a play by George H. Dillon, a senior
on campus who collaborated with an-
other member of the young theater in
“Spring” put on last season by the
“Studio Players,” a little theatre group
of rating standing.

“Black Velvet”

With the usual finesse which he
employs in all his productions, Frank
Keenan now playing in “Black Vel-
vet” at the Studebaker, puts across
the character of the typical southern
gentleman refined in the art o£ chiv-
alry and drinking mint julep. He has
succeeded in acquiring the soft gut-
teral tones of a southern colonel al-

the most jovial personality and cure the
deepest rooted soul of despondency. *

“ Song of the Flame”

The newest of the musical romantic
operettas came to the Apollo with bally-
hoo enough to launch Ford for presi-
dent. The play lives up to a portion of
this advertising, but it should not be
measured to “The Student Prince” if it
is to be accepted as first rate entertain-
ment. Some good voices, gorgeous set-
tings and costumes of much purple and
crimson.

“The Vagabond. King”

What appears as another aspirant for
the throne of “The Student Prince” reg-
isters a trifle better than he aforemen-
ioned Apollo inhabitat. The show has
just enough slapstick Elizabethan com-
edy, to uinate the dramatic quality and
enough drama to spoil what otherwise
migth be a guffawing comedy. Dennis
King, in spite of his Doug Fairbanks-
complex is very charming and handles
the part of Francois Villon—the vaga-
bond poet of “If I Were King” in all
of its true dramatic action.

“The Passing Show”

The Four Cohans houses this institu-
tion of the American revue. It comes
up to the average musical show with
chorus, funsters, occasional classic sing-
ers. It continues for the reason that
makes the drama so unpopular, the rea-
son night life and bootleggers prosper.
“Sweetheart Time” and “Castles In the
Air” are the remaining pieces with mu-
sic of significance. The former, too new
to be reviewed and the latter too old to
attempt to enlighen people who should
have seen it months ago.

“Kongo”

With the smell of perspiration, the
dampness of the tropics and the slip-
slop shuffle of runners, Walter Huston
brings into the Princess what he and the
producers hope to be another “White
Cargo.” Mr. Stevens of the Hearst A.

“best melodrama since ‘Rain’!”

How to Start the Year Write \/

“Lou” (or “Lucy”), said the venera-
ble Dean to the very young person
beside his desk, “the very best start
you can make in college is to get
yourself a fine new fountain pen.
Nothing like it for lecture notes,
required readings, memoranda.
Provided it’s dependable. Now this
one, I myself have used for a college
generation!”

The dear old Dean might just as
well have said, “Go get yourself a
Wahl Pen.” For there is no foun-
tain pen that’s more of a help in
any course—it writes like a charm,
it holds more ink, it fills up in a
jiffy and refills clean—and it’s the
most dependable of all.

Romp over to the Wahl Pen and
Eversharp counter now, and get

yourself the Wahl you like. AD
styles there — slim, thick, long,
short: every one of’em holding far
more ink than other pens that look
much bigger. Nice looking, too:
solid gold or sterling silver, gold-
or silver-filled, red, black, or
mottled rubber. Exactly the point
that suits your hand: stiff or flex-
ible, fine, medium, stub, oblique or
Wahl Standard Signature—all in
iridium-tipped solid gold.

From cap to nib, a Wahl Pen’s
practically indestructible. One
bought now will last you all
through college and the first six

PEACE PROBLEMS

Prof. Schlesinger Cites Un-
equal Distribution of

Luxuries as Cause

Perhaps chemistry has within its
grasp the answer to the hope for
world peace despite the black charges
of destruction in war, layed at its
door, according to Prof. Herman I.
Schlesinger of the University.

One of the principal actual and
potential causes of war has always
been the unequal distribution of the
necessities and luxuries of life, and
despite jealousies and pride for oth-
er reasons, “the decisive factor con-
sciously or unconsciously is fear,”
the speaker asserted.

Science has shown that peoples
are no longer dependent upon natu-
ral monopolies of the means for pro-
ducing food, clothing and shelter in
many cases, and will further prove
that fact, the chemist declared,
pointing to the nitrate processes, and
the manufacture of aluminum, a
metal not found pure in nature, as
outstanding examples.

“Science alone can teach that
ills resulting from monopolies cre-
ated by natural advantages for it
tends to equalize the resources of all
nations, it stimulates enterprise and
these fears are groundless,” the
speaker said of the cause for war

“Lingo ” Aids Van Vechten’s Latest

“Nigger Heaven”

“Blues,” “pinks,” “monkey-chas-
ers”—a strange lingo of a strange,
somewhat exotic group, creates a
convincing picture of life in the Ne-
gro city of Harlem, in Carl Van
Vechten’s latest book, “Nigger Heav-
en.” Mr. Van Vechten has taken his
material from a Source hitherto quite
unexploited ;by literary men; this
new, unusual material has afforded
him opportunity to indulge his so-
phisticated taste and style in the col-
orful and luxurious pleasures of thj?
individual group.

The author, however, does not
deal with his people unsypmatheti-
cally; in fact there’s some that will
say that he has written “Negro
Propaganda” (whatever that may
be). Aside from the rich atmosphere
he has created, Mr. Van Cechten has
written an absorbing story of two vi-

vid personalities placed in an irre-
vocably unhappy life situation.

“Nigger Heaven” is surely a dusky
heaven—and more like hell than
heaven.

such a demand, but as a safeguard

Storms are raging on the sun as
well as on earth at the present time al-
though there is no known relation be-
tween the disturbances according to Prof.
E. B. Frost, director of the Yerkes Ob-
servatory of the University who yester-
day notified the University oi two gi-
gantic sun spots now readily visible to
the naked eye through a smoked glass.

“This disturbance has apparently de-
veloped from a deep seated center also
active at the end of June,” Prof. Frost’s
report continued. “It is in solar latitude
about twenty-three degrees north. It
came around the east side of the sun
about three to four days ago and was
first seen here when it was very near the
edge. Many photographs have been

made by^our assistant, W. W. Morgan,
and very rapid changes are taking place,
particularly in the second group which
came into visibility slightly after the
first.

“There is a pretty £oou chance that
a magnetic storm and northern lights
may occur within the next few days.
However this is by no means certain to
happen. No terrestrial consequences
other than those named of a magnetic
and auroral character can yet be attribu-
ted with certainty to the sun spots and
there is no occasion for any popular su-
perstition on the subject.”

Sun spots are not generally visible to
the naked eyes until the group is of the
order of 100,000 miles in extent. Prof.
Frost concluded.

days of plus-fours.

And no wonder. Throw back the hinged

When problems press and your spirits slip

AND TOUCHBALL

Managers Arrange Schedules
For Coining

Season

The Intramural touch-hall tournament
which will get under way on Tuesday,
Oct. 12 will serve to usher in what is
planned to be the most successful sea-
son yet enjoyed in local Intramural his-
tory. This ever-popular sport will be
under the supervision of Harry Hagey
this fall, and the latter has set Friday,
Oct. 8, as the deadline for receipt of
entry lists.

Mr. Hagey, when interviewed, said:
"’This fall’s touchball’s tourney will be
a magnificent, stupendous, dazzling
event, far outshining in brillance any-
thing of its kind ever held on our be-
loved Midway."

Pai U Defend* Title

The touchball tournament last year
attracted unusual attention and the ri-
valry was exceptionally keen. The Psi
Upsilons wop after a bitterly contested
series of games, and they will “have a
task on their hands to retain their hard-
'won laurels this year.

Coincident with the announcement on
the touchball totirney situation came the
news of the setting of the opening date
for the horseshoe tournament. “Entries
for this event must be in by Friday, Oct.
8, and competition will begin on the
following Wedesday, the 13th,” an-
nounced W. H. Herbert, who has charge
oPihis sport.

Issue Booklet

The full schedules for both the touch-
ball and horse-shoe tournaments will be
published in the form of a booklet which
will, in all probability, be issued on Mon-
day.

The Messrs. Hagey’s and Herbert’s
eyes shone with a wondrous fire as they
recounted the prizes to be awarded the
winners and runners-up in both tourna-
ments.

COACH A. A. STAGG

Article Praises
Stagg’s Record,

Life, Sincerity

An article in this week’s Big Ten
Weekly, contrasting the personalities
of the various Big Ten coaches, has
the following to say about A. A.
Stagg of Chicago.

"Not many men in any line of en-
deavor have such a record as Coach
A. A. Stagg, the veteran Maroon ath-
letic director, who has been at one
job for thirty-five years. His life as
a football and track coach and athletic
director is well known to most fol-
lowers of college sport as are his All-
American days at Yale, his long work
on the football rules committee and
his constant fight for righteousness
and honesty in intercollegiate sports.

“To trap Stagg ito saying some-
thing he does not mean is impossible.
He is a man who speaks little and
slowly, choosing his words cautiously
and with close attention to their strict
meaning. He is an excellent public

SPECIAL DESIGN
USED FOR NEW

STADIUM TRACK

Has Special Curves, Three
Straightways; Is

Judged Unique

Much has been said about Chicago’s
new stadium, its size, construction, com-
pletion, and things in general which will
make it a better place /or the placing
and watching of football. In the heat
and fervor of the fast approaching grid
season, some things of importance in
the stadium have been slighted in pub-
licity. One of these things is the new
quarter-mile running track, which will
mean a great deal of the track prestige
of the Midway when the time comes for
the Interscholastic and Intercollegiate
meets.

Coach Stagg, realizing this importance
has personally supervised the construc-
tion, and devoted much of his time to it
this summer.

With the aid of three architects, he
has evolved what he believes to be a
unique quarter-mile running track. The
feature of this track is the three-phase
curve at each end which permits the
quarter mile to be squeezed into a space
which would ordinarily accommodate
only a fifth of a mile circuit.

In building the new grandstand, Coach
Stagg was faced with the problem of
providing a new cinder path for track
meets. The old oval running north and
south had to be destroyed and a new one,
running east ad west, had to be built.
With the prospective concrete stands on
the east end of the field, it was found
that a quarter-mile track of the old type
with simple semicircular ends could not
be put in.

Special Design

Architects believed a quarter-mile
track could not be built in the area avail-
able because of the difficulty of curving
the ends. Coach Stagg thought it could
be done, however, and set them to work.

Purdue A Real
Rah Rah School

Well! Somewhat iew, astonish- I
ing, or what have you—a school
for cheerleaders! Purdue is the
instigator of this new idea, and a
member of their English depart-
ment, Prof. P. H. Scott, lecturer
on mob psychology and the hand-
ling of large crowds, and Harry
Clark, former cheerleader, are con-
ducting the second annual session
of this unique school.

The men try out, after complet-
ing the so-called course, for uni-
versity yell leader, and a number
of. assistants are appointed from
the remainder. Evidently yell lead-
ing is developing into an art, and
a visit to the class reveals that it
is more than getting out in front of
the stands and waving the arms
like a shipwrecked mariner seek-
ing aid. Purdue’s scientific treat-
ment of the subject seems to be
getting results.

WOMEN BEGIN GYM
WORK ON MONDAY

Gymnasium classes for women will
begin Monday with 9 and 10 o’closck
clases and will continue throughout
the day, according to a statement re-
ceived from Miss Gertrude Dudley,
head of the Physical Culture depart-
ment. Classes will meet in the main
gymnasium. Due to the physical ex-
aminations scheduled for1 Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday no further
classes wil meet until Friday.

“A change has been made in the
ojcial gym costume,” said Miss Dud-
ley. “Entering students will be ex-
pected to wear the new type of outfit
which can be obtained at the Univer-
sity boogstore. However, those who
already own outfits used in previous
classes here need not supply them-
selves with the new kind.”

TEAM INTACT AS STAGG POLISHES
INDIVIDUAL PLAY OF MEN IN FINAL
PREPARATION FOR FLORIDA BATTLE

Punting and Passing Practice
Follows Wednesday’s
Scrimmage

Coach Stagg evidently hopes that
his team will avoid making the cus-
tomary opening game infractions of
the football fundamentals when they
meet Florida Saturday for the Ma-
roons spent the entire practice session
last night drilling on basic principles.
Charging, blocking, side-stepping, pass-
ing, receiving, punting, place-kicking
and drop-kicking were the day’s
menu, and a number of trivial faults
were cleared up. The practice was
secret.

Except for a few minor bruises suf-
fered from Wednesday’s fierce scrim-
mage the squad was in excellent con-
dition. The men were divided into
two groups—one composed of the
backs and ends, and another of the
linemen. Both groups plugged vigor-
ously as there is keen competition for
first string berths. Nearly all the men
considered for backfield jobs took a
turn at heaving the ball. Rouse, Mc-
Donough and Anderson were the most
accurate. Macklind did some pretty
receiving.

Rouse and McDonough did the punt-
ing, stressing a quick get-a-way. The
other backs received and ran back the
kicks. Practice ended promptly at 6.
During the week Borden, Lewis and
Weislow have been showing up the
strongest among the tackle candidates.
Of the guards Wolff and Neff are

Crisler Predicts Grueling

Contest; Describes

Florida Attack

By Victor Rotems

“A heavy, powerful team—the Ma-
roons are in for an unusually tough
opening game.” This is the comment
,oT Fritz Crisler in regard to tomor-
row’s game with the University of
Florida. And he should know for he
scouted Florida’s opener with South-
ern last Saturday.

Although Florida made but 16
points Crisler declared that the Cy-
clone Staters were noticeably holding
back. Florida’s attack was almost
wholly constituted by vicious line
thrusts and off-tackle drives. Bishop,
185 pound fullback, carried the ball
on the bucks while Livingston and
Rhrig, crack halfbacks, were effective
in advancing the ball around the tack-
les. The Florida eleven has a bulky
line featured by Davis and Clements,
^two tackles, both of whom weigh over
200 pounds, and by Captain Saraa who
is a veteran center. Goldstein, one
of the guards, sports 226 pounds of
beef.

Strong Defense

This combination presents a discour-
agingly strong defense. Southern’s
offensive attempts were completely
smothered. Crisler said, however,
that the Florida men are somewhat
green to the game as yet. They will
have the advantage over Chicago in
the matter of physical condition due
to better training circumstances.

WMAQ Broadcasts All Maroon
Games, Both at Home and Away

All of the Chicago football games are
to be broadcasted over The Daily News
station, WMAQ, this season, it was an-
nounced yesterday. Not only will the
followers of Maroon hopes be able to
listen in on the weekly battles at Stagg
Field, but will also share with the spec-
tators, an inside view to the play when
the Staggmen travel to foreign soil, of
special interest to the students will be
the broadcasting of the Pennsylvania
game on October 16th.

Arrangements have betn made at
Stagg Field to assure the best broadcast-
easting facilities possible. A special
booth has been constructed in the
new stadium, and fully equipped
with steam heat, electric lights, and
tables for microphone and amplify-

ing instruments. The upper part of
the booth has large panes of glass,
which will provide “Hal and Harry,”
WMAQ’s famous football announc-
ers, with a clear bird’s eye view of
the entire gridiron. This up to date
booth is large enough to accommo-
date two announcers and two opera-
tors.

In addition to the vivid word pic-
ture which this unique broadcasting
service will furnish to the hosts of
Maroon fans unable to attend the
games, The Daily News has prepared
an accessory, called the visulizor, to
make the play by play description
more lifelike. This consists of a
miniature gridiron for following the
trend of the battle and for recording
the score, line-ups, penalties, etc.

“Stagg is a past master in the art

Hancock, sophomores, are the best of
the reserve material for this position.
K. Rouse will undoubtedly retain his
job at center.

Capt. Marks will probably play full,
with S. Rouse and McKinney or An-
derson at halfbacks. ^IcDonough is
slated for the quarterback job, but
Macklind will most likely be given a
chance. McDonough has been shifted
from end which he played last season
to fill this gap. The Florida game
will be used as a basis for determin-
ing the future first stringers.

Three straightaway stretches have
been added to the quarter-mile track.
One in front of the new north grand-
stand gives a reach of 220 yards. An-
other stretching to the east on the south
side ends at the wall of Bartlett Gym-
nasium, and the other on the cast side
extends to the souh wall of the field.

On the quarter-mile track proper, the

straight stretches on the north and south
sides extend for 197 fee. The first phase
of the curve, on a radius of 120 feet,
extends for 157 feet, the second phase
on a radius of 275 feet extends for 150
feet. The third phase is the same as
the first. These measurements are ap-
proximate to give an idea of the layout.

Coach Stagg put in many days himself

helping to grade cinders, appearing with
the day laborers, hatless and tanned
yielding a shovel of the type profession-
ally known as a No. 2. He ordered die
gangs about as though they were only
so many football players in training.

For football games, temporary bleach-
ers will be erected over the south and
east sections of the track.

2. And if we haven’t got him, there
is no doubt that somebody, in .the
house is a dear friend of his who can
be trusted to deliver any messages or
to take his place at any rendezvous.

what uncertainly at night are not sick.
