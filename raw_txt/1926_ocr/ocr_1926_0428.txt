This attempt brings to mind many
attempts of this nature carried on by
members of churches and religious
societies. The five men wish to bring
out the fact, however, that in reality
it is nothing on this kind. Rather

political machines had beaten, and candidates less worthy who
had ridden these machines to victory. The various class honors,
he said, have ceased to be a reward of faithful work, conferred by a
disinterested tribunal; they have become the goal of clever schem-1
ing. He named two fraternities; unless you are a member of one
of these, he said, you have little chance of becoming the head of a
certain important activity.

Our friend recommended that we, as editor of The Daily Ma-
roon, expose some of these carryings-on. We must show these
fellows up; we must let them know that we condemn all this; then
they will find out that the public condemns it too. That, our friend
argued, is the function of a newspaper. We must watch for politi-
cal schemers, and when we find one flay him. Thus we can warn [
next year’s politicians. What is a newspaper for, if not to improve}
the community? And how can it improve the community, but by
telling its readers the truth?

“All of this,” we told our friend, “sounds quite reasonable.”
We have neglected, unluckily, to inform ourselves as an editor should
on such subjects; hence we could neither agree nor disagree with
our friend on specific facts. Yet his argument did sound reasonable
Without doubt, a newspaper ought to dig up the truth, bitter or
sweet, and offer it to the public. Without doubt, such a process
would benefit the community. It would in a measure punish offen-
ders, atone for the offense, and warn those who might offend in the
future. We do not know horn much or how little the campus needs
to be cleaned up; but surely we ought to find out, and try our hand
at the job, if there is one.

Nevertheless, we told our friend, we shall not do these things.
We are not big enough for the job, or good enough for it. These
scheming politcicians (if scheming politicians there be) are no
rascals. They are students, like us, trying to get through college
without being driven insane by bibliographies, or frightened out of
their shoes by flunk notices, or bored to death by The Daily Ma-
roon. Like us, they sometimes try to do the right thing; like us,
they sometimes try to do something else. In this game of digging
up the truth, the editor of The Daily Maroon (and his friend) might
come out the winners; but they might not. We do not like such
risks, for our part.

Improving the community, as our friend agreed, is a big order.
We have smaller ones, more fitted to our powers and our circum-
stances,—and plenty of them. We must, for instance, publish a
decent issue of The Daily Maroon every day. (Our friend inter-
rupted at this point to remark that the freshmen do most of the
work about our office; we ignored him.) Then we must attend three
classes a day, write an occasional paper, and seem intelligent to
our instructors. We must take our laundry to Fifty-Fifth Street
once a week. We must argue with a cleaner-and-presser who visits
our fraternity house every morning with a bill against us. We must
do a dozen such things. Now we are not (we told our friend)
the sort of man who always tells you how busy he is; yet we are
hardly in a position to add the Herculean labors to our program.

Besides, we said, we shall be alumni in a couple of months.
There is much to think about in these days that remain, and much |
to study, and much to say to our friends, before we tell them
goodbye.

In the consolation the Crane and Til-

WHAT p/ IT?

^IOI\(it MORGENSTERN

It is a matter of more than passing
interest that the University, after
years of hopeless endeavor, has at last
swung a successful interscholastic.
For decades and for centuries—-or so
it would seem to the disinterested ob-
server—the University has been try-
ing to lure trusting and inexperienced
high schoolboys into the spider’s net
that centers around Cobb Hall. But
for some unknown reason, the lads
in knee pants have shied off, and di-
rected their footsteps to such places
as I have pointed out here before) as
Denison. Beloit. Oberlin and North
Shore Country Day School. Indeed,
these athletic functions the university
have promoted to the end of decoy-
ing in the high school athletes have
without exception up to last Satur-
day night proved failures.

A complete track team will journey
to Bloomington Saturday to take on
Coach Hay’s new flock of Indiana
tracksters. The meet is the first dual
outdoor affair of the year for Chicago
and it will be important in giving
outdoor track a good start. The team
is very weak in some events yet the
consensus gives Chicago a slight edge.

Weak In Three Events

The weaknesses lie especially in the
pole vault, the javelin thow, the ham-
mer and the broad jump. All men who
can do any of these things are urged
to come out at either eleven or twelve
o’clock, when the varsity practises,
and try out for places on the team.
Any man who even thinks that he
can broad jump is urged to try out.
for jump material is scarce.

T he entries as they went in for the
Indiana meet are. for the 190 and 220
yard dashes, Armstrong. Kernwein.
Mickleberry, McKinney. Weddell and
L. E. Smith; for the 440 yard run,
Armstrong Boynton. Capt. Cusack.
Hegovitch, Metzenburg and Mickle-
berry;’for the 880 yard run. Boynton,
Kelso, Capt. Cusack. Dugan, and
Hegovich; for the one and two miles,
James Cusack. Boynton. Dystrup,
Hegovich, Hitz, Koenigshurg. and
Kent; for the high and low hurdles,
L. E. Smith, Weddell Morrison Met-
zenburg, and McKinney; for the
jumps, Burg. Brill, Cody, Kauffman.

“Bub” Henderson to

Coach Maroon Line

Coach Stagg announced the prob-
able addition of Fred “Bub” Hen-
derson to his staff of coaches yes-
terday. Henderson, captain of the
team last year and unanimous All-
Western choice, is to take charge
of the line next fall.

There is somedoubt as to wheth-
er Henderson will be able to ac-
cept the position. He says that
he will on the condition that he
will be back at the law school next
fall. If, however, he is not able to
return to school he will not accept
the post.

If Henderson will be able to as-
sume his duties as a coach it will
aid the Maioon team considerably.
For he has had eight years of actual
playing experience at the St. John’s
Military Academy and here, thus
knowing practically all there is to
know about the playing of a line
position. “He is all that a tackle
should be," is what Mr. Stagg says
of him.

GRIDDERS DRILL

WITH NEW SHIFT

“Clap Hands” Times Play
For Staggmen

“C lap hands here comes Stan now.”
Those who stroll around Stagg Field
these days are certainly familiar with
the rythmical echo—echo of clapping
hands. For those who do not frequent
these parts o fthe campus, we merely
mention the fact that it is not the
pile drivers that are making the noise.

The Maroon grid squad is practic-
ing on a new shift play involving the I
clap-hands performance as a timing
aid. And the way tht play has worked
in practice, it appears as if it will be
a reliable ground gainer for the Ma-
roons next fall. Stan Rouse has been
reeling off some excellent gains on
this deceptive play.

Coach Stagg does not appear en-
tirely satisfied with the showing of
the turnout for spring drill. Hancock
is the only man over 190 pounds and
it appears that unless some dark horse
turns up the Maroons will have one
of the lightest lines in the Big Ten.
after almost a decade of 200 pounders.

TAKE LEAD IN FOURTH FRAME BUT

DE PAUL TIES KNOT AT SIX ALL;

GUBBINS SCORES WINNING COUNTER

Marks Begins in Box for Locals; Gubbins Takes Mound
In Fifth and Wins Own Game; Large
Crowd Attends First Home Game

By Tom Stephenson

DePaul University came over and
gave the Norgrenites a real practice
game yesterday afternoon. It was only
a practice tilt, but the Maroons were
out to win it,'whatever it was, and
they did after a grueling seven inning
battle. The score was 7 to 6, and
the winning run was registered in the
last half of the last inning by Cap-
tain Gubbins, himself, after a beautiful I
hit by “Tex Gordon” turned the most i
crucial moment of the game into a win
for the Maroons. This was their first
taste of victory, and it should go a
long ways towards preparing them for
the coming game with Vogel and
Schalk’s University' of Wisconsin Nine
next Saturday.

Score by Innings—

De Paul ........... 1	2 1 0

Chicago ........... 0	2 0 4

Both teams used two
Marks and Gubbins hurling
cago and Miller and Maas for DePaul.
Joe went in for Wallie at the fifth
inning and Miller, ex-Northwestern
mound man, replaced Maas in the
fourth, after the latter had weakened
in that inning to allow four runs.
Marks transferred to right field, re-
placing Lurie.

Same Men Play

Norgren used practically the same
line-up as has been playing, mainly
Anderson, Macklind, McConnel, Brig-
nail, McDonough, Webster, Hoerger.
and Marks and Gubbins. Lurie and
Gordon also got into the game. The

I) 2 0—6
0 0 1—7
pitchers,
for Chi-

return of Hoerger. after a ten day-
lay off due to a bad ankle, was a
matter of strength to the team. The
De Paul team consisted of Gaffney,
Calahan, Bordes. iLacey, Recarraro.
Hoban, Reilly. Kelly, and Miller.

In the fourth inning, with a score at
4 to 2 against them, the Maroons
started a rally that ended in the retire-
ment of the De Paul hurler. Gubbins
hit safely to first, and went to sec-
i ond on a sacrifice bunt by' Chuck
Hoerger, McDonough walked, and
Gubbins scored on a two bagger by
Kyle Anderson. Macklind (followed
up with a long hit which brought in
McDonough, and then McConnell sent
home Andy and Macklind with an-
other two-base hit .

Gubby pitched faultless ball the
next inning, but was hit hard in the
sixth, the DePaulians bringing the
score to a tie at six all. Miller held
the Maroons countless.

Then came the all-important last
inning. Joe exhibited some of his no-
hit form and put the first three bat-
ter down ip one-two-three order.
Then Gubbins won his own game,
when he ran out the last strike of a
fan-out, after Kelly, the DePaul catch-
er muffed the hall. “Tex” Gordon,
batting for McDonough, brought him
home after Gubbins had stolen third
base.

Last night I dreamed the strangest
dream—

I dreamed that with the morn
My hair was silk, my face was smooth
I was a man re-born.

And as I sauntered past old Cobb,
Maids gazed with longing eyes —
My looks, my grace, my virile charm
Brought winsome, lonesome sighs.

The very large list of entries is for
the same reason. Coach Stagg has had
little opportunity to hold tryouts and
so he can not make up-a small team

i ears, but medals as well. In the Bart-
I lett locker rooms they saw pictures
I of that lot of superior beings, the Ma-
roon varsity wrestling team. Who

I can tell what aspirations those pic-
j tures aroused? The high school boys,
| one assumes, saw them and felt the
I surge of emotion that would naturally
come when they realized that they,
too, could some day cross their arms
across their brawny chests in just
such other pictures. With that realiza-

list without the risk of cutting some |
of the men of really good calibre, so i
it has been arranged to make the j

Back in those good old days when
the daring undergrads rode their
bikes around town with their feet
on the handle bars, and a race
between two-wheclers was a gala
event—even in those good old
days Anheuser-Busch was nation-
ally known among good fellows.
And now, with bicycles as rare
as free lunch and pretzels,

There is a cycle of fashion

line of work into which

But your job has to fit
your head as well as your
hat, for it has to fit your
state of mind.

Like your hat also, your
job needs to fit your purse.
Therefore, why not choose
one that brings not only
satisfaction in service but
in financial return.

Selling life insurance isone
of the few modern busi-
nesses that does just this.

It takes:

Intelligence, Zest
and Ability

It gives:

Liberty of action, the
philosophic satisfaction of
selling future security and
present serenity to living
people, and a response, im-
mediate and tangible, in
monetary as well as mental
reward.
