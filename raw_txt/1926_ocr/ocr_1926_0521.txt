RESERVE BOXES
FOR WOMEN AT
TRACK AWARDS

Friday Demand Exhausts
Seats; Allot Boxes
for Saturday

PLAN NEW LIGHTING
EFFECTS FOR SING

Because the Women’s Interscho-
lastic Rushing Committee received
more reservations for boxes for Se-
nior Vaudeville than they could fill,
the same plan will be used for the
Presentation of Awards Saturday
night. This will also take care of
those women’s organizations that
found it impossible to come in a
body Friday.

When the new plan was made
known many of the group who al-
ready had boxes for Vaudeville,
signed up for Saturday night also.
Assignments for boxes were made
by lot.

Liat Friday Audience

For senior Vaudeville the person-
nel of the left side of the horseshoe

will be as follows: Box A, Quad-
rangler, Box B, Pi Delta Phi. Box

Submerged and indirect lighting
about the fountain in Hutchinson
court is the plan which will be
carried out at the Interfraternity
Sing which takes place on the eve-
ning of June 12. This idea will
be used as an addition to the dec-
orations of previous Sings.

According to Gifford Hitz, man-
ager of the Sing, such a method of
staging should prove very effec-
tive. In an effort to make this the
best Sing on record, the Council
is said to be expending more mon-
ey than ever before for decora-
tions.

Fraternity drawings for posi-
tions will take place at noon to-
day. Holmes Boynton and Gif-
ford JHitz representing the In-
terfraternity council, and Ned
Earl and Frank Selfridge for the
Alumni Association will meet at
lunch in the University Club for
this, purpose. When the order of
appearance has been determined
upon, the results of the confer-
ence will be sent directly to the
fraternities. Thirty-five of them
are expected to participate.

ACTIVITY GROUP

A new sketch written by two well
known campus humorists—Dan Rich
and Leo Stone—which reflects the
campus woman better than the Mir-
ror show itself, coupled with many
other original and startling novelties,
is the feature of the senior vaude-
ville show to be put on in Mandel
in connection with the approaching
Interscholastic track meet.

Never has a campus show been
so rich in original material. So say
Fred Handschy and Helen Liggett
who are in charge of this year’s pro-
duction. Fred Von Ammon, Al Fos-
ter, and Frank Kinsey are going to
put on a song and dance act in which
Von Ammon’s original music will be
used, in which Kinsey will do some

Joanna Downs is to sing some
songs that she has composed

Von

her-

self. They are said to be good.

The famous' saxephone sextet
which performs in the second act of
Blackfriars, is going to play some
different music in this show. Anoth-
er Blackfriar’s star, Don McGinnis,

A cloud burst and tornado are
the reasons why this year’s Cap and
Gown will not appear on time. It
«? ems that ten forms containing
1250 pages each were utterly ruined
when the storms turned over a truck
from Dixon, Illinois, bringing the
unbound book to the local jobbers.

According to schedules the book
was due to make its appearance on
campus today. The downtown bind-
ers were ready to put the book in
complete form yesterday.

Forms Destroyed

Cuts and printed matter contained
in the forms were completely dis-
mantled and destroyed according to
John Meyer, editor of the book. Six
cuts will have to be re-engraved.

Several cuts of art work by James
Root, art editor of the publication,
and recently elected assistant editor
of the Phoenix, had to be entirely

Alpha.” And with a piquant toss
of his head he fluttered into Cobb
hall.

The Mu Alpha tobacco adver-
tisers have started a new fad
around campus. The novel pledge
buttons of the bull’s head and
shovel organization are bringing
back memories of the dear old
“roll your own” days. In most
every fraternity house the boys
are smoking ungainly cigarets with
twisted ends.

“No, v^e don’t advocate the
smoking of Bull Durham tobacco,”
said the pledge reflectively adjust-
ing the tag to a more prominent
position on his lapel, “all you
have to do is pull the tag off a
sack of Bull Durham and you’re
a pledge.”

Give Saturday Drawing*

On Saturday night at the presen-
tation of Awards, the drawings of
the left tier of boxes are these:
Box A, Freshman Women’s club, Box
B, Esoteric, Box C, Deltho, Box D,
Sigma, Box F, Chi Rho Sigma. For
the right tier Box A, W. A. A.,
Box B, Federation, Box C, Mortar
Board, Box D, Achoth, Box E, Phi
Beta Delta, Box F, Wyvern.

After the presentation of Awards
the women have been urged to attend
the Moonlight dance, from nine un-
til the ringing of the chimes in Hut-
chinson court. Refreshments will be
served by Sign of the Sickle. After
the dance and after the Vaudeville]
on Friday night.

FEDERATION SEEKS
OPINION OF WOMEN
ON CLOSED GRADING

Because of the fact that a refer-
endum taken at the last open Fed-
eration council meeting showed a
large majority of the women present
in favor of a closed system of grad-
ing, the subject will be discussed at
the next meeting Tuesday from 7
to 8 in the library of Ida Noyes hall.
In connection with this subject the
consideration of such questions as
whether or not grades are an impor-
tant factor in such questions as
whether or not grades are an im-
portant factor in cheating, whether
or not they play too important a
part in the student’s attitude to-
wards his college career, and wheth-
er or not they hinder rather than
help his scholarship will be discuss-
ed.

In order to follow out the sub-
ject, and to find a real solution to the
question, several members of the fac-
ulty have been invited to join in
the discussion, in addition to mem-
bers of Federation. The discussions
held so far this year have proved
valuable both to the organizations
working on student problems and to
the students participating in the dis-
cussions, according to Hannah John-
son, chairman of the organization.

Scholarship Rating High In
Winter Quarter

Undergraduates in activities again
scored high scholarship in the win-
ter quarter, according to statistics
just compiled for the director of
ativities. The staff of the Phoenix
led in high averages, with the mem-
bers of Gargoyles and Tower Players
running second and the Mirror third.

The figures compiled show that
the Phoenix, with thirteen members,
had an average of 3.78; the Maroon,
twenty-two members, 3.31; the Cap
and Gown, fifty memberss 3.2$;;
making a general average for the
eighty-five students in publications
of 3.37. Twenty-eight members
making public appearance for Gar-
goyles and Tower players achieved
an average of 3.46, while the sixty-
seven appearing in the first annual
Mirror counted 3.40. The general
average for dramatic activities, with
ninety-five students, was 3.32.

The actvities graded were only
those in which the undergraduates
participate throughout the entire
year. Statistics on the quarterly ac-
tivities were not compiled.

Registration of graduate students
for the Summer quarter will take
place the week, May 24 to 29 from
10 to 12, and 2 to 3, in the grad-
uate offices. This will be the only
opportunity for graduate students
to register before June 19.

PRESENT ‘ANTIGON’
AS ETA SIGMA PHI
ANNUAL PRODUCTION

Eta Sigma Phi, the undergraduate
Classical club of the University, will
present the “Antigone” of Sophocles
next Friday evening at 8:30 in the
Reynolds club theater. The produc-
tion of a play is an annual event of
the organization. The “Medea” of
Euripides was enacted last year.
The play will be given in approved
Greek manner and style.

The following members of the club
have been chosen for the cast: Creon,
William Wilder; Antigone, Georgia
Robinson; Eurydice, Marjorie Coo-
per; Ismene, Rosalia Schultz; Guard,
Stanley Weaver; Teiresias, Henry
Ephron; and Haemon, Coleman
Parsons. There is also a chorus of
six women under the direction of
Beryl Beringer who has had special
work in classical dancing.

Tickets for the performance may
be obtained for fifty cents any time
before next Friday from Margaret
Novak, president of the organization,
and chairman of the ticket sales. Tic-
kets may also be procured from all
members of the Classical club.

graduation The appointment as yet
has not been acted upon by the Uni-
versity officials.

This position is in the nature of a
graduate fellowship and includes
tuition and laboratory fees in addi-
tion to $450 a year. According to
Prof. Julius Stieglitz, head of the
Chemistry department, the recom-
mendation comes as a recognition of
the splendid record of Miller in the
department, and the interest he has
shown in chemistry for the last four
years. He is considered fully quali-
fied for the position.

In addition to being president of
the senior class Miller is president of
the undergraduate Phi Beta Kappa
a university marshal and a member
of the Undergraduate council. Dur-
ing his four years in school, Miller
has been active in Intramural Sports,
president of the Romans, and man-
ager of the organized department of
last year’s Track Interscholastic.

Deans of all schools of the Uni-

the annual installation dinner of the
(International Students’ association,
tonight at 6:30 in the Hutchinson
cafe. Frederick C. Woodward, vice-
president of the University, will be
the chief speaker of the evening.

“We are anxious that all members
of the organization attend the din-
ner,” said H. Y. Cho, retiring presi-
dent, “since this will be the last so-
cial reunion of the club this year,
and every provision has been made to
make it an enjoyable one.”

Sale of tickets to the dinner will
not be limited to members of the as-
sociation. All planning to attend
should procure their tickets ahead
of time, as none will be sold at the
door, according to Cho. Tickets have
been placed on sale for seventy-
five cents from members of the cab-
inet, at the Y. W. C. A. and Y. M.

Incoming officers are these: Ray-
mond Oshimo, president, Mona Vol-
kei\ vice-president; Antonio Riveria,
recording secretary; Alice Kinsman,
corresponding secretary; Milquedez
Ibanez, treasurer; William Paul, Har-
ry Whang and Haksoo Kim, members
at large.

Fiye undergraduates have been
convicted of scholastic dishonesty
and sentenced by the Honor Commis-
sion within the past months, it was
learned today.

The most severe case was that of
a student in the chemistry depart-
ment who took an examination for
a man who did not feel that he could
pass it. Expulsion from the Uni-
versity—the extreme penalty—was
imposed by the student-faculty body.
This case, according to the annals
of the commission, is almost the only
one of its type on record.

Another student who handed in
part of a master’s thesis as a term
paper lost credit in the course and
was suspended for two quarters. The
third, case was that of a man who
had plagiarized a term paper. Judg-
ment descended also upon the head
of a student who handed in a term
paper that had been used before.
The last sentence was imposed for
copying in a mid-term examination.
The penalty for the last three misde-
meanors was loss of credit in the
course and two quarters of proba-
tion.

PLAY-GOERS FAVOR
SWEETS AT Y. W.

QUADRANGLE FETE

Mrs. Woodward New
Orchestra Director
*

Mrs. F. C. Woodward was elected
one of the directors of the Univer-
sity Orchestral association at its
meeting held last Tuesday, not an
assistant to Mrs. Ernest Freund, the
secretary-treasurer, as was announc-
ed by an error in yesterday’s Daily
Maroon.

As a result of last week’s sales
at the Quadrangle fete it was de-
termined that ice cream and candy
were the best sellers. The Quad-
rangle fete sponsored by Y. W. C. A.
is held at all the performances of
“Wallie Watch Out” in Hutchinson
court.

As in previous years, each booth
has been placed under the supervi-
sion of a class. At the freshman
botth presided over by Violet
Holmes, flowers will be sold. Punch
and pop will be sold at the sopho-
more booth under the direction of
Eloise Kresse. The junior booth will
handle candy and peanuts and the
senior booth ice cream comes under
Miriam Walker and Helen Wooding
respectively. The prize winning song
by Norman Reid will be sold at the
fifth booth of the fete.

In order to avoid confusion at the
booths ten cent tickets will be sold
by members of the Y. W. finance
committee. Profits from the booths
will go to the Y. W. fund. “We con-

Seat Sales Indicate Packed
House as Production

Makes Last Bow

With splendid prospects for dupli-
cating its triumph of last week, “Wal-
lie Watch Out,” the annual Black-
friar production, starts on its last
three performances in Mandel hall
tonight. Following the Saturday mat-
inee and evening shows, “Wallie”
will take its place in Blackfriar his-
tory alongside “The Naughy Nine-
ties,” and “Kaiti from Haiti.”

The seat sales for this week, says
Charles Cowan, have been exception-
al, and it is probable that the house
will be sold out for all three perform-
ances. A few good seats, however,
remain for the Saturday perform-
ances.

Wins Great Favor

Probably never before, according
to those interested in Blackfriars,
has a Blackfriar show won such pop-
ular favor. At all three perform-
ances last week, the house was filled,
and seats for this week are already
at a premium.

Students are generous in their
praise of Marvin Hintz, who plays
the title role of Wallie. In his por-
trayal of the unsuspecting Freshman,
Hintz, they declare, is without an
equal. A brilliant career in campus
dramatics is predicted for him, as he
is now taking his first part in a Uni-
versity production.

Laud Leading Ladies

The excellence of Clyde Keutzer
and Don McGinnis’ work as campus
women is attested by the attention
they have been given in the down-
town newspapers, which have devot-
ed considerable space to the two fe-
male stars and to their photographs.

Seward Covert, who has long
been prominent in campus dramatics,
plays the part of the dashing col-
legian in his usual style.

Especially popular with the crowds
this year are the dancing specialties
which are directed by Archie Scott,
a professional dancing instructor. So
sucessful has Mr. Scott’s work been
that it is probable the practice of
engaging a special coach will be
continued. Mr. Scott directed the
dancing for the Haresfoot show this
year.

Coleman Pleased

Hamilton Coleman, who for a num-
ber of years has directed the Black-
friar productions, expresses himself .
as highly pleased with the success
of “Wallie Watch Out.”

Newspaper critics have been par-
ticularly interested in the “Rhapsody
in Blue” number, since a similar
feature is part of George White’s
“Scandals.” The author of the Black-
friar number it is understood, is con-
sidering challenging George White
to determine which version of the
Rhapsody is the more popular.

The following women have been
appointed as Score saleswomen for

STRAIGHT-JACKETS

'T'HE college activities are not stationary things. They are not
T —or should not be—a routine to be pursued from year to
year according to set forms. They are, rather a constant growth.
Unless the college plays, newspapers, and magazines try always
to improve their tactics, to find new and better ideas, and to adapt
themselves to changing conditions, these activities will have little
value.

The policy of recent years has been to draw up, in writing,
detailed constitutions and by -laws for the college activities. Meth-
ods of electing officers, of organizing and maintaining staffs, and
even of performing the day’s work, have been described in great
detail, and enacted into law. This, the graduating seniors have
told their successors, is the way to carry on your work—and the
only way. Amend the constitution if you like; but that is no
asy job. Except in rare emergneies, use the methods that the
constitution outlines.

Some student affairs need written constitutions. Elections,
og course, must be standardized. This man is qualified to vote, that
man is not. The vote is open, or it is by secret ballot. There
are certain specified ways in which a man may become a candi-
date. Such regulations must be made beforehand, because in
an election every man must have as fair a chance as possible.

But to go further and say just how the day’s work shall
be done, is foolish. The abbot of Blackfriars five years ago could
not have foretold just what staff organization, how many offi-
cers, etc., Blackfriars would need in 1926. Last June the execu-
tives of The Daily Maroon framed a constitution that has already
noticeably hindered the staff's progres. Tlhe(r i constitution
failed, not because it is a bad constitution (for it is a good one),
bu because unforeseen things have happened. We have found new
ways of getting news, and new ways of presenting it- We have
tried new business methods. Staff members have unexpected
chances for work in other activities. We have discovered special
talents among some staff members, and special lack of talent
among others. Such events must be dealt with, not at long range
by he lawmakers of a year ago, but by those who are concerned
with the events themselves.

Constitution-making is too difficult an art for college stu-
dents. Their activities (except for a few mechanical processes
like elecions) can not be reduced to formula. Nor have they time
to reduce things to formula. They have problems of the moment.
If the college plays, newspapers, and magazines try always to
improve their tactics, to find new and better ideas, and to adapt
themselves to changing conditions, hey need not worry about the
by-laws of the future.

ON BEING WEL BRED

“T came up to see about my work!”
' She had planted herself stoutly in a chair by the instructor’s
desk.

“You are not doing very well,” was the instructo’s comment.
“You receive a poor grade in your midterm and have not been
able to recite when I have called on you in class.”

“Am I gonna get an ‘A’?”

“You most certainly are not.”

“Well what sort of grade am I in line for?”

“A very poor one if I were to grade you on the work done
thus far.”

“Well, gosh, I always got A’s in this stuff before. You know
Mr. ......... told	me to take you for a course last quarter; but

gee, I’m glad I didn’t.”

The instructor smiled quietly.

“So, I’m not gonna get an A ?’

“No.”

“Well, if I do a lot of reciting and studying from now on will
it help?”

“Yes.”

“Yes.”

• ’dl, all right then, but gosh! I’m glad I didn’t have you for
course.” She bounced out of the room.

SEVEN DAYS SHOT-TO HELL?
The Lord made fishes, eels and frogs.
The Lord made hens and cats—
The Lord made ostriches and hogs,
And terrapins and rats.

(The Lord was much dissatisfied,
And many other creatures tried.)

The Lord made anthropophagi,

And dinosaurs and fleas—

And fish that climb and squirrels that fly,
Plesiosaurs and bees.

(Yet they could not the good Lord please.

He swore to better such as these.)

The Lord a final effort made

Upon a noble plan;

He called all Heaven to his aid—
And the result was Man.

Note—After the Lord was finished, one of the more ambitious
angels took a crack at the Creator job. The result of his efforts
was Woman. This blotch so displeased God that the hapless angel
was tossed to Hell. Such treatments was quite unfair, because
the Woman was better anyhow than some of the buzzards the
Lord made after much more practise!

She remembered the same bits of Edna St. Vincent Milet.
Rupert Brooks, Snowshoe Al tickled her,
“Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” was the sublest
Sort of humor.

All the poignant bits of everything
That I cherished—she too loved.

I dared to think of future talks . . .

And oh, how she danced.

I hoped—I dreamed

She was damnably attractive . . .

Then she told me she lived on 151st Street!

Only You Can’t Botle Them Up

Turk, old thing:

To your compendium of masculine opinions in regard to women,
you may add mine: They are like bum gin—only a fool is fond
of them. In any quantity at all they make one sick, prolonged at-
tention makes a wreck of the best, and they leave one with a
bad aste in the mouth.	—the Ramblin’ Kid

AND ALONG CAME ATLAS
Dear Tamara:	*

Truly the imagination of a feminine mind with an inferiority
complex is amazing! No, my dear, you have the wrong dope al-
together. I am not in the habit of cultivating parlor maids, high
school children, moustachios, waitresses, nor Y. M. C. A. commit-
tees; and as for the “nasty little poewms,” I’m sorry you felt
obliged to take them so to your little hear.. How can you ignore
he main issues of this noble argument, started by our astute
Sevie, a gentleman and a scholar (not a bit cuddly), to indulge—
woman-like—in petty and ignoble personalities? You have almost
ruined the ravishing picture which your name calls up in my
imagination..........demure, wistful, golden-haired, blue-eyed,
sweet-tempered little campus women .... How sad, how young,
and yet how wise! It is evident, my dear, that in spite of your
advanced years, in regard to men you have either been terribly
disillusioned, or else never had any experience at all; Try a
few—they’re a bit like oysters—go down better a second time—
many ways of serving ’em—ask Sis, she has the right idea.

As for women in the abstract, they are great! “Modern, civi-
lized woman is a work of art, the most marvelous the industry of
man has yet produced,” says Anatole France. You are the charm-
ing chef-d’oeuvre which the civilizing forces of man’s labors has
produced! You are a lovely golden heifer of an idol, to whom we
take off our hats, whose carfare we pay, whom we take to the
Crillon, who keeps yellow paint on the taxi cabs—In spite for
which? You hunch up your back; stick out your claws; and spit
at us—and still we like to pet you—in the hope that you might
purr!	—Atlas

FLANNELS for distinctive business and sport suits
.	. for Tennis, Golf, for all outdoor sports.

An Ideal Combination

is a JERREMS four-piece suit
which includes long trousers for busi-
ness . . . and KNICKERS for travel-
ing and sports—the coat is made with
the regular plain back and with a good
display of freedom across the shoulders,
with bellows or patch pockets. Corded
or welted seams are in demand.

Harris Tweeds, Shetlands, Gab-
ardines, Biltmore handwoven
Homespuns and FOX FLANNELS
are favorite fabrics.

Many men prefer the coat half belted
with gathers ... a style suitable for
business or sport.

Also Cricket Flannels, Whip
cords, Tropical Worsteds, and
Gabardines for hot weather.

Real Values, Suits or Overcoats,
$65, 75, $85 and up

WE SUGGEST KNICKERS WITH
EVERY SUIT

“Her Strength Is Ten For Her Heart Is Pure”

This time, Atlas, it is my turn to agree with you. A woman
certainly is like a mirror. Break one and bad luck will folow you.
But why blame her if the reflection is shallow?—after all it is
just a reflection. —Sis

A NEW VERSION	_____

Women are so odd, we see,
Indeed so very strange when
They act like fools, but we agree
God won’t, and we can’t change them.

But men are smart, so it’s not .sin
To take love as we find it—
Our woman’s looks to glory in,
Her dumbness, not to mind it!

TODAY it might well be said—Whistle! Thy name is Woman.
Incidentally, we hereby rule out all references to Schopenhauer in
any shape, manner or deform!

ALL this today is but representative of our motto: WHEN
BETTER CONTRIBUTIONS A. IE MADE, THE WHISTLE WILL
TAKE THEM!	—TERRIBLE TURK

First Perfect Game This

Year as Macs Take
Title

Today will see the start of the

Through the sensational pitching
of Irving ’Goodman, who hurled a
perfect no-hit game, the Macs easily
won the Non-fraternity Indoor
Championship yesterday afternoon by
defeating the Romans 4 to 0. Good-
man fanned 19 out of a possible 21
and did not allow a man to reach
'first. Makela and Meyer were the
only Romans to touch the horsehide
both being easy outs. Ball of the
Romans also pitched excellent ball
holding the hard hitting Macs to four
hits and three walks.

Jack Sheer starred with the stick
by slamming a homer with two on
in the third inning to score three
runs for the winners. Sheer also
scored the first run. Anderson and
Semmer also played well for the
Macs. This makes an average of 18
strikes a game for Goodman in his
last two starts. By virtue of their
victory, the Macs stamped themselves
as powerful contenders for the Uni-
versity title, when they enter the
semi-finals next week.

Consistent Hurler

That this stellar hurling by Good-
man is to be feared in the coming
championship contests is warranted
by a glance through his record for
the whole season. Besides not losing
a single game in the entire play to
the title, no opposing team has
scored over 5 runs off his tricky
pitching, and several of them have
been held scoreless. In a game
against the Senators, Goodman pitch-
ed faultless ball to fan out the first
sixteen men to bat against him. He
won this game bya runaway score,
and set a no-hit record for the In-
tramural league, which was only to
be bettered by his yesterday’s show-
ing.

The consistent work of Goodman
has kept the ability of the other
members of the non-fraternity cham-
pionship team in the dark, except
for the batting skill. In this depart-
ment, the Macs have two of the hard-
est hitters of the I-M league in Sheer
and Plotkin. These men led the bat-
ting average of the non-fraternity
division, and are looked for to put
the Macs through some stiff games
with the Fraternity league winners.
Other men on the Mac outfit are F.

Anderson, J. Anderson, Cohn,
heimer, Semmer and Leviton.

Phi Pi Phi, 12; Phi Delt,
Phi Pi Phi won its way into

by

defeating the dangerous Phi Delt
nine 12 to 1. Led by Kraft, who
hurled a four-hit game, and helped
considerably by four home-runs, two
each by Carlson and Staudt, the vic-
tors annexed this crucial contest by
steady playing through-out the whole
fray.

especially so in the finals.

Although the world at large is
turning its attention to the National
Interscholastic meet at Soldiers Field
the interest of the University of Chi-
cago undergraduate will be focused
on the remnants of Stagg field next
Friday afternoon where the finals in
the Intramural track events and the
championship indoor baseball game
will be held. The event, which is for-
mally known as the second annual In-
tramural Spring Festival, will cul-
minate the activities of the Intra-
mural department tor this season and
will incidentally crown two new or-
ganzation champions. In conjunction
with the track meet, the final fresh-
man varsity meet will take place.

permit the reduction of the big en-
try list to five finalists in each event

Once more the sturdy Maroon four
sets out to annex another golf meet,
but this time away from home. They
leave tonight for Champaign to
meet the doughty Illini squad in
their initial away from home con-
tests having won all previous meets.

The four men who will play for
the locals are Captain Kenny Hisert,
Art Patterson, Johnny Bartlett and
J. Dorsey. These four have been
on the Maroon lineup all this season
and will probably play through the
remainder of the year unless one of
them falls into a terrible slump.

This is Captain Hisert’s last year
in Conference competition and he
will be lost to the team after this
season. But the other three will be
here to play next year, and with the
addition of several new men who are
at present frosh, the squad will prob-
ably be almost as strong as it is at
present.

The man who will play in first
position for the Illini is M. O’Connell
who was the bright light of last
year’s four. This season, with more
experience under his belt, he should
prove a worthy foe of Captain Hisert
in their match Saturday morning.
His teammates are Bard, Clark and
Schooff.

situation, however, is this:—The
track is merely cut down to five laps
to the mile instead of four. Other-
wise it is exactly as it was last year.
The track is being kept in good shape
for the meet and on Friday it will
be exceptionally fast.”

This afternoon the powerful net-
men from Wisconsin will match rac-

thus far this season while the Ma-

Coach Reed’s team will include
Capt. Schaeffer, Shapinsky, who is
undefeated thus far this season,
Hudnn, the colored sensation, Hall,
Drain, and possibly Bennett. Sha-
(pinsky and Schaeffer (should wlin
their matches, so that the outcome
of the matches hinges on the dou-
bles showing. Against Michigan, the
locals had a 3-2 lead before the dou-
bles matches started; then the Wol-
verines copped the two doubles
matches and copped the meet 4 to
3. The Cardinals also have a record
as being particularly strong in dou-
bles play.

The showing that the Maroons
make against the Badgers will give
a line as to how they will fare in the
•Conference meet next week against
the cream of the Conference includ-
ing such stellar performers as Krick-
baum of Michigan and O’Connell of
Illinois.

The Intramural department is es-

non-fraternity groups and individ-
uals who are unattached, according
to Weddell and special prizes for in-
dividuals have been secured. The
fact that five places in each event
will count and the ineligibility for
competition in the meet of practical-

out by the officials as proof that it

Intercollegiate Net Meet

At Philadelphia This Year

The intercollegiate lawn tennis ( The winner of the Big Ten Con-

year in a tourney which is scheduled»they do, will stand a rather good

will be conducted by the Interscho-
lastic, Lawn Tennis Association un-
der the auspices of the United States
Lawn Tennis Association and is to
be played on the grounds of the
Merion Crickey Club, at Haverford.

The meet is annually one of the
most successful intercollegiate titu-
lar events. Universities and colleges
from all sections of the nation are
invited to enter each year and each
year there is a keen struggle for su-
premacy between the various teams.

chance to come out with a win. Last
year the University of California
made a clean sweep of the affair
taking both the singles and the dou-
bles championships. This year the
Bear’s teams will be strong but are
not expected that they will repeat
their last year’s feat.

Each school may enter a team of
not more than four singles players
and two doubles teams. A special
provision is made so that no two
men from the same university will
meet before the second, or if pos-
sible, the third round. The playing
rules which will govern the tourney
will be the rules of the United States
association.

Chicago gathers its shattered track
strength Saturday and departs for
Minneapolis to meet the University
of Minnesota in a real battle. The
Maroon team strength has been sap-
ped by injuries and inteligibilities
but the men still have the spirit and
still have the power to scrap the
Gophers to a finish.

From one angle there is every rea-
son why Minnesota should be better:
that is from the training and condi-
tioning angle. The Maroons have
had a meet every Saturday since the
season rest last week-end. Which
may, and again which may not, be
a good thing for Minnesota.

The northern team has several
stars on its weight list, chief of
whom is Drill who has an effort of
43 feet 5 3-4 inches to his credit.
But Chicago has Hobscheid, Rouse,
Olwin, Henderson, Wolf, and sev-
eral other husky lads, who certainly
ought to be able to put the pill far-
ther than the Minnesotamen. Only
one thing mars the proceedings—
with Shabiner ineligible the Gophers
may score a slam in the javelin.

In the quarter the Minnesota out-
fit has a real star in Morrison. Mor-
rison has actually run the 440 in an
even 50 seconds, which puts him up
among the conference leaders. Then
also, the team has a few good dash
men—Gruhagen who placed in this
event at the Drake relays, and Sheilds
who used to run the hundred in ten
flat while still in high school.

All of which however doesn’t mean
so much when the Maroon list of
performers is looked over. There is
a whole array of best bets—foremost

Here’s One of The

Special Invitations

Hot on the heels of the news
that a high school lad in a small
town in Colorado had high jump-
ed six feet, one and one-eight
inches the Interscholastic commit-
tee sent out a special invitation
yesterday afternoon. The speial is
now winging its way to Emil Olan-
der, at the Grover High School
of Grover, Colorado, the boy who
broke the Colorado state record
last Saturday.

The lad had learned to jump in
tennis shoes, old and torn, and
had managed to go over at five
feet 6 inches. At the big state meet
someone loaned him a pair of
spiked shoes, and he cleared the
bar at six feet one and one-eighth
inch, a mark that compares fav-
orably with the Interscholastic
record.

So now his townspeople are
taking up a contribution to buy
him a grand pair of spiked shoes,
and to send him to the Interscho-
lastic to set a new national record.

The Maroon baseball outfit will
attempt to grab their third conse-
cutive victory when they will engage
in the national pastime with a ball
club representing the Purdue univer-
sity tomorrow afternoon on the Mid-
way lot. A victory for Norgren’s
men would give them a .500 per-
centage with three wins and a like
number of defeats. A defeat for
Purdue would also give them a .500
percentage so if Chicago wins mat-
ters will be simplified greatly for the
individuals who compute the league
standings.

Purdue Strength Varies

Purdue has a peculiar team this
season. One day they are invincible
showing form of the first calibre and
the next day, well, they are not. The
result of tomorrow’s game will de-
pend] somewhat /on this fact. It
might be added that the Maroons
also look invincible-like once in a
while, and they have retained that
aspect for the last two or three
weeks, giving no indication that they
will drop it Saturday afternoon.

But on good days and on bad ones
the Purdue men are dangerous with

By Victor Roteru#

In order that the 22nd annual
World’s Greatest Interscholastic will
be all that the name implies, the cor-
respondent rushing committee has
been fully organized, and has ef-
fected the immediate dispatch of a
huge number of personal invitations
to the best talented high school track
athletes in the land.

The committee after an exhaustive
research of the records made by in-
terscholastic stars throughout the
country tendered these honor invi-
tations to the athletes making the
best track marks during the year.

Invite Nation’s Beat

These i men have ; accomplished
truly remarkable feats on the cin-
ders and on the field, and, without a
doubt, if the major portion of them
compete as expected there will be a
wholesale shattering of former na-
tional marks made in the annual
meeting.

The list is long and impressive.
Haines, national interscholastic 220
low hurdles record holder, and An-
derson, state champion in 120 high
hurdles, are two San Bernardino,
Colo., flashes, who have been spe-
cially invited. A number of others
equally as great: Miller of Elmwood,
Ill., and Wiggins of El Dorado, Ill.,
who recently were tied in the high
jump with leaps of 6 feet and 3 5-8
inches at Urbana; Taylor, St. John’s
Military Academy, who covered the
120 yards of high hurdles in 15 1-10
seconds at the Ohio State Relays for
a new world’s academic record; Jim-
my Patterson, Tilden, Illinois State
sprint champ; and Beckmeyer, Car-
lisle, Ill., and Ramsey of Senn, the
pair who finished 1, 2, in the 440
yard run at the State meet, both
breaking the old record.

BADGER ELEVENS IN

PRACTICE CONTESTS

Madison, Wis., May 20.—Battling
gamely in ankle deep mud, the Navy
reversed the tables of last week and
defeated the Army, 6 to 0 in the
second of the spring football drills of
Coach George Little’s program. The
Army was forced to use more than
its shock troops but found all to no
avail. Coach Little was in favor of
calling off the tilt until better weath-
er but not such with the two bat-
tling elevens.

It is this kind of spirit that is go-
ing to produce real Badgers for the
coming season on the gridiron. It is
also such weather that the Badgers
seem to fall heir to on game days,
and the teams were in favor of get-
ting used to it right now. The game
fairly sparkled, despite the leaden
skies and a constant downpour of
rain, with good football. The slip-
pery ball, weighty feet, and soaked
uniforms could not stop the two
elevens as they fought, nothing short
of battled, under these adverse con-
ditions.

The Badger leader was more than
pleased with the work and will now
have until Saturday to prepare for
the titular clash that is to be staged
at Camp Randall on Saturday. Both
elevens will be out in full force to
do or die. The spring title is at stake.

Gubbins To Hurl

Gubbins, who gave a pleasing ac-
count of himself in the Northwest-

the visitors. Macklind will be held
in reserve. Either McHargue and
Hulswitt will adopt the hurling job
for Purdue. Both are quite depend-
able pitchers but they occasionally
blow-up with the rest of the team.

Chicago cannot as yet be counted
out of the rae as Michigan, the
leader, is very liable to become a
victim to a couple spills which would
give them three setbacks, the same
as suffered by the Norgrenites. The
Maroons will have to do some heroic
playing, however, to finish the sea-
son without another defeat.

The Junior class is going to have
an original party at the expense of

ments to secure Ida Noyes hall on
June 2.

There will be dancing, rotation
