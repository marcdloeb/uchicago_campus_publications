IT grieves me to see the nice argu-
ments that 1 have gotten up with va-
rious fellows in this column invari-
ably blow off in smoke after a couple
of exchanges of c.nipiiments. Last
year, for instance. Terrible Turk and I
stuck knives in each other’s backs
through an enjoyable two weeks, but
one fine morning I awoke to find that
there wasn’t any argument in progress
any more. Early this fall, one of the
boys who has a key to fumble took
offense at some slighting remarks I
had made about Phi Beta Kappa, and
rose up in righteous wrath and talked
back. But he, too, popped out shortly.
Recently, the irritation of The Daily
lllini over my remarks on their Home-
coming helped me to pass along the
dull days. It was great sport for a
while, but The Daily lllini got tired
of playing after a week or So, and went

In the controversy raging over
the question of allowing students to
have car' while at their respective
centers of learning. Ohio State Uni-
versity seems to have promulgated
the best measure of the day. It does
not forbid cars, but it does regulate
the use of them to the extent of
holding a traffic court once ji week.
At this court, presided over by
President Rightmire, all traffic
violators are made to report and

and if the alibis fail, penalties are
meted out in proportion to the of-
fense. Thus the debate is settled.

As Healthy Sex

“Women of today

healthier

than ever before, far healthier than
men.” declared Dr. John Richards of
the Rush Medical college yesterday.
Dr. Richards gave his statement in re-
ply to the discussion of fiat-chested
women which has led to the belief
that women arc becoming subject to
tuberculosis to a greater degree than
before.

“Of course if chest expansion is re-
duced, tuberculosis has a better chance
and if women develop flat chests they
provoke tuberculosis,” he added.

The general good health of women,
he attributed to the lightness of cloth-
ing. frequently weighing under two
pounds. He accused men of coddling
themselves and of wearing clothes as
heavy as their bodies."

“I don’t see how they can stand it
with so little on in these cold days,
but if they can so much the better and
good for them,” Dr. Richards stated.

REVEAL LIFE OF

ANATOLE FRANCE

Publisher Tells of Author In
Talk Today

M. Edouard Champion will reveal
the intimate life of Anatole France at
a lecture to be delivered at 4:30 today
in Harper Assembly room. The lec-
ture will be given entirely in French.

M.
and
the
that
tack

Campion is a Parisian publisher
bibliophile on his first tour of
United States, and it is expected
his lecture will in part be an at-
on the book “Anatole France en

Pantouffles” written by an

tary of M. France.

In an interview M.
dared the statements
which is written in a

Champion de-
in this book,
sketchy, note-

book style rather than as a formal
biography, were mostly false, and that
it was written out of spite when the
secretary was discharged. He claimed
that the biography, with a companion
volume as yet unpublished, was writ-
ten before France’s death and held
until the master should be unable to
defend himself from the charges made.
M. Champion also avers that the most
insulting portions did not appear in
the English translation.

M. Champion is the head of one of
the most important French publishing
houses, one which his father bought
from the father of Anatole France. He
speaks almost no English, and his
wife, an American, acts as his inter-
preter. While in the West he witness-
ed his first game of football and was
greatly impressed by it.

Today's lecture is the second M. i
Champion has delivered on campus;
Tuesday he talked on Marcel Proust.
He will speak at Northwestern be-
fore leaving the city Saturday. He has!
written eighteen volumes of biography ।
and criticism.

Social Swirl in Front of' Cobb

Misses Opportunities in Bulletins

“students are not aware of the op-
portunities that confront them in front
of Cobb hall at regular intervals,"
said Dean Laing, of the Graduate
School of Arts and Literature, through
his secretary. This statement comes
about on account of the valuable no-
tices of scholarships and allied sub-
jects which are posted but are not
made use of because they are not seen
by the students. "Hardly a week goes
by without some notice of importance
being posted for inspection,” he de-
clared.

As a single example: Wellesley Col-
lege is offering a scholarship for

graduate women of any reliable Ameri-
can college. This fellowship, known
as the Alice Freeman Palmer fellow-
ship, yields around $1000 and is knowm
to be one of the best of its type given
throughout the country. The fellow-
ship may be used for study abroad, for
study in any American institution, or
for private independent research. The
conditions of the scholarship are that
the women be not more than 26 years
of age, in good physical condition, un-
married, and ss free as possible from
all responsibilities. Here is just one of
the ' bulletined opportunities open to
the students of the University.

While “The Phoenix” increases its
circulation, the various women’s clubs
and organizations on campus will in-
crease their charity funds.

Too few women in the past were
willing to sell "Phoenixes.” Upon in-
vestigation of the reason for their re-
fusal, it was learned that the three
cent commission embarrassed them.
According to the new plan which has
been inaugurated, members of Y. W.,
Federation, W. A. A., and the social
clubs will act as saleswomen, and the
commissions will be sent to the organ-
izations which they represent. Each

month a check for

a bonus of

ten dollars will be
that turns in the
sales, and for the
saleswoman there
five dollars, which

she may, or may not, turn into her or-
ganization. ,

Practically every woman’s activity in
the university has a charity fund, an,d
all the social clubs have scholarship
funds or university development
pledges. Mrs. Edith Foster Flint gives
her sanction to the plan since it will
help the organizations to meet their
obligations.

If a sufficient increase in circulation
is recorded at the end pf the year, the
club or organization which has the
highest sales record will be awarded
a scholarship for the next three quar-
ters.

When new and old students meet Friday at 8 in Mandel hall
to make Chicago’s defiance heard in the Twin cities, a former Ma-

The band will start its march at 7:30 to collect the students in

Tear Bombs Nip
Freshmen Spirit

It takes tear-bombs to supress
college spirit.

At variance with the’opinion gen-
erally harbored by psychologists
that “mob spirit is supreme” comes
this account of a freshman riot at
the University of Michigan. Dur-
ing a pre-game rally, the yearlings
evidently heated by their enthusi-
asm, attempted to rush several of
the theatres in Ann Arbor; one
house gave a riot call when the
throng tried to force its doors, and
the police threw tear gas bombs
into the midst of the mob which
not only effectively dispersed the
freshmen, but resulted in the injury
of one. Four were jailed.

Poli. Sci. Classes

Investigate Voting

Political science students at the
University spent a large part of yes-
terday gaining first hand information
concerning the present day voting
system. Led by the professors of po-
litical science, they invaded the polling
places and spent the day as watchers.
Some of them stayed at their posts
late into the night and helped to guard
the rights of the voters when the bal-
lots were being, tallied.

By their work yesterday, they ex-
pect to learn a great deal more about
the method of balloting now in use
than they could gain by reading books.
They saw the various operations in-
volved in casting a ballot and tallying
it and they will probably learn the
ways in which many voters dis-en-
franchise themselves by marking their
ballots incorrectly.

International House of Columbia

Cited as Model by Mr. Dickson

"The spirit of International House

at New York is wonderful," said Mr.
Bruce W. Dickson. Advisor of For-
eign SUidents, who has just returned
from a week’s visit there, "it is the
only one of its kind in the world.”

The purpose of International House
is to promote a feeling of friendliness
between students in New York by
uniting them as one big family. About
sixty different nationalities are repre-
sented although one fourth are Ameri-
cans. Professor Walker, who has
been taking a leave of absence from
the Chicago Theological Seminary, is

living at International House while
pursuing his studies at Columbia.

There are two wings to the build-
ing. the men occupy one wing and the
women the other. The main floor is
open for social activities where the
men and women may intermingle and
have club meetings. A refectory with
cafeteria or restaurant service is avail-
able. Mr. and Mrs. Dickson were
much impressed by the success of the
House as it has been in operation
only three years. Mr. Dickson re-
marked in closing. “It is a unique sit-
uation, and a friendly attitude in work
and social intermingling prevails.”

iNE of our spies at the Meat Packers Convention last week has re-
ported to us a casual conversation which we hold to be of

particular significance. While loitering in the Reynolds club our
agent noted the entrance of two distinguished looking conferees
from the convention. He immediately assumed his most nonchal-
ant manner, sauntered after the packers, and dropped into a seat
near theirs, pretending to read the Literary Digest.

Extacts from the conversation include such lines as, fine idea
of Mason’s to draw the business men closer to the University, and
“the ramifications of the President's introductory talk were very
apt.” The whole purport of'the talk was one of satisfaction with
the proceedings and the results of the Conference.

The attitude of these men, and we think their attitude is rep-
resentative of a growing sentiment among Chicago’s civic and in-
dustrial leaders, is one of interest and friendliness toward the Uni-
versity. President Mason has sought to build just such an attitude,
to bring the University into closer contact with the practical life of
the city, to effect a rapproachement between the citizens of Chicago
and the University of Chicago.

President Mason is evidently succeeding in this most laudable
of undertakings.

THE OPEN DOOR

^HE PLEA of collegians the campus over has poured forth in a
fruitless chant: “Coffee shop open until 10! Coffee shop open
until 10!” And The Daily Marner, has supported this plea. Tooth
and nail, hoof and mouth, we have gone into the battle for an open
door to the coffee shop. And we shall fight until the last gedunker
has fallen.

Word comes one of these past days from the Interfraternity
council that such things as informal council meetings be held weekly,
or semi-weekly, or bi-weekly. Now by informal meetings the inter-
fraternity council means very informal meetings. That is to say, a
big happy family gathering. And everyone knows that the fratern-
ity house, apotheosis of decorum and quietude, is no place for in-
formality.

In other words—but we shall not beat around the bush. We
want these informal council meetings to be held in the coffee shop.
Not that we care a great deal where the council meets, eats, or heats.
But we do want the coffee shop to be open in the evenings. Open
late in the evenings. Open as late as oh!—say ten o’clock.

Other schools have rendezvous of one sort or another, where
’the boys and girls get together at ungodly hours with a “vive la
compagnie! and that sort of thing. Why not Chicago? Other
collegians have their wailing places. Why not Chicagoans?

Must we defy the management of the coffee shop? Must we

you he couldn’t get along without it,
because it takes the drudgery out of
writing up his lectures and preparing
his reports and theses. Besides the
time it saves, the Portable provides
neater work than could possibly be
turned out by hand. Profs are human,
you know, and they appreciate and
reward neat and legible work.

You’ll find Remington Portable the

of the

Gamma Delta and the Kappa
fought a fierce battle to a

and Harris were the big stars

Word comes from the Intramural
office that those horseshoe games
which were postponed on Monday
because of bad weather are being re-
scheduled. Announcements as to
just when their teams will play will
be sent out to the various organ-
izations so as to leave ample time
for the notifying of the various

of the game T olman passed to Jones
for a sixty yard gain. Shortly after
this the ball was put over. Schaffer
then proceeded to catch a pass from
the kick off and ran for a touchdown.
Bartlett passed to Shuler for forty-
five yards and a touchdown.

During the second half Tolman pass-
ed thirty yards to Harris who ran
thirty-five yards for a score. Near
the end of the game Jones took the
ball on an end run for another touch-
down. The game was exceedingly in-
teresting and the spectators vouched

contestants.

Much interest
these games due
they are the last
tion schedule and

is centered in
to the fact that
on the participa-
the winners will

eventually play for the champion-
ship of the University. A full turn-
out of the contesting teams is ex-
pected as many close matches be-
tween this season’s bitterest rivals
are scheduled.

Rivalry between those traditional
enemies, the Illini and the Maroons
will soon be taken up in another form,
bowling. A challenge sent by the
University of Illinois has excited in-
tense interest, coming as it does on
the eve of the football game with that
institution.

Bill King, who is in charge of the
Uni varsity bowling allies has accepted
the challenge and predicts the matches
to be held in the near future. Don
Stokes is in charge of the Illinois al-
leys and proposes a match in which
five men representatives from each
school will participate. The scores of
the matches will be telegraphed.

Tryouts Next Week

In order that the squad have ample
time to practise it is desirable that all
aspirants for positions on the team
turn in their name to King before the
end of this week.

Seven members of Wisconsin’s
1926 football squad, residing in Chi-

good their bids for berths on the
Badger roster and are scampering

their house today it seemed as they
couldn't help winning. All the boys
had football shoes with honest-to-
goodness cleets. Some were arrayed
in brand new spick and span sweat
shirts and pants while others wore
their knickers which were stuffed with
paper to protect them f rom the ter-
rific blows which they were to receive
when tagged.

During the first half the Delt’s in-
vaded the Phi Phi’s territory to the
ten yard line. Then the Phi Ph’s
gained their second wind, summoned
up their determination and bravely
marched ninety yards down the field
for a touchdown. Wyandt, then ran
back a punt making the only score
the Delt’s received.

Second Half Scoreless

Maroon followers will have a chance
to size up the freshman squad Fri-
day when two picked teams of the
yearlings put on a game as a feature
of the homecoming program. The game
will be the annual “Yale-Harvard"
clash which hitherto has been played
after the last game of the season.

The game is played with the .regula-
tion periods and under the regulation
rulings and each year the frosh put on
exhibitions that are comparable to the
varsity contests in the speed and good
football shown. During the last few
years the games have been more or
less even in score and the well matched
ability of the teams contributes to the
close playing.

Large Crowd Expected

Each year much interest is aroused
by the contest and the stands are us-
ually well filled. 1 his year a larger
crowd than usual is expected for the
battle will be run in conjunction with
the rest of the Homecoming Celebra-
tion program and many Alumni and

Beginning next Monday and bowling
at his own convenience each prospec-
tive pin smasher will bowl five games.
The five men whose scores for these
five games are highest will constitute
the team.

This is the first opportunity for all
pin sharks to show their- wares, and
all men who are interested in this
popular winter sport are urged to turn
in their name immediately to King and
to start practising so that they will
be in best possible condition for the
tryouts.

JUNIOR COLLEGE

WOMEN VICTORS

Freshman and Sophomore women’s
hockey teams won their respective
games with the Seniors and the Ju-
niors in the first game of the tourna-
ment series which was played on the
Midway yesterday.

Handicapped by lack of sufficient
players, the Seniors were beaten by
the green team, with a score of 4 to 3.
In the first half the Freshmen had lit-
tle difficulty in making their hard hits
count; but during the last part of the
game the Senior backs, beginning to
show form, made up for lack in num-
bers by their consistently good play-
ing-

With the Illinois game, vastly im-’
portant in itself, taking on an even
more significant air due to Homecom-
ing, Stagg’s Maroons are going about
their work more impressively and more
conscientiously than at any other time
this season. The Illini game is a big
factor on each year’s football schedule
and to win or lose this practically
amounts to a successful or unsuccess-
ful season.

If the Maroons win all will be for-
given and forgotten. The coaches and
men who work nightly under the
shimmering rays of the big spot lights
with the white “ghost balls” are well
aware of this fact, and they are prac-
ticing with redoubled vigorousness and
energy.

Practice Snappy

Last night there was considerable
snap and enthusiasm present. The
regular varsity backfield bucked
against a freshman line while the reg-
ular varsity line were on the defensive
against the onslaughts of the fresh-
man backs. Details in both the offen-
sive and defensive work of the varsity
men were stressed. The line which is
acquiring football lore game by game
received an extravagant amount of
attention.

A line which was able to crash
through and render nil the efforts of
Penn’s quartet of magicians must be
indeed some line. And it is this line
which the Maroons will face Satur-
day. In the Ohio game the green
Chicago forward wall showed promise,
but if it will be whipped into good
enough shape to cope with Illinois’
best by Saturday somebody will be in
line for congratulations.

So fkr Ken Rouse has played as a

good center should, and the work of
Wolff, Weislow and Apitz has been
good but the remainder of the lines-
men have showed nothing to brag
about.

Stagg realizes that both the offense
and defense need polishing, so he is
devoting a fair share of the time to
each. Illinois showed but a spurt of
forward passing in the Pennsylvania
battle and they are expected to rely
tiainly on a running attack when they
come here, with Peters and Stewart
skirting the ends and Daugherity
plunging through the line.

Jinx Hovers Over

Ann Arbor Tilt

Madison, Wis., Nov. 3, 1926.—If
the jinx is hovering over Ferry Field
when George Little trots his scraping
Badgers out to face Fielding Yost’s
wonderful eleven of Big Ten leaders,
there may be another upset to furtrer
jumble this hectic grid season. This
assertion regarding the jinx because
this coming battle is the thirteenth
time that Michigan and Wisconsin
have played football since the game
was taken up by these two institu-
tions.

In twelve encounters the Wolver-
ines have taken the honors exactly
nine times, while Wisconsin may right-
fully claim a pair of victories. One
contest was played to a draw in 1921,
7 to 7. The two schools first met on
the gridiron in 1892 when the Wol-
verines copped, 10 to 6, but the fol-
lowing fall the Badgers avenged this
defeat, winning easily 24 to 18.
