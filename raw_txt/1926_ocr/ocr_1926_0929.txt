Exchanging the customary “Glad
to see you back, how was the sum-
mer?” line with one of the lady re-
porters who lounge around the sump-
tuous Maroon office yesterday after-
noon, I was told that it seemed hard
to get back to the business of daily
work on the paper again after the
summer period of idleness. The
transition from summer and its dog
days and the porch swing to fall,
rushing, the paper and the rest of it,
abrupt as it may seem to some peo-
ple, has not, however, especially dis-
turbed me. A tranquil soul amidst
all the vicissitudes of this oftentimes
grating life, I take things much as
they come at all times. This period,
incoming freshmen Think the old frat
clubs (I quote that legendary cam-
pus figure, Mr. Ben Tunrner) are
something other than they actually
are, has not caused my collar to wilt,
or my appetite to diminish.

With all this as it is, I reiterate
that this transition from the idleness
of summer to the toil of autumn has
not been especially pronounced in
my mind. Summer might just as
well be fall, for ail the effect it has
on my status, for always I remain a
dilettante in idleness with the pass-
ing of the days. Summer and winter
I am constant in my laziness.

Temper mentally endowed as I am
with the supreme gift of laziness, I
am spared the trouble of ever having
to readjust myself to changed condi-
tions—to work, for example, after
summer idleness.

This first column of the year, I
might say, is written, A, with the
view of getting acclimated to the
front page, after a long year toward
the rear end of the sheet; B, for
the purpose of seeing whether the
old line of oil, good for any amount
of space a year ago at such times as
the Editor, one Al Heaid of Cedar
Rapids, was short of other dust to
throw in the eyes of campus; and, C,
with the idea of letting those unfor-
tunate souls—incoming freshmen and
such—into whose drab souls this col-
umn has never cast its cheering light,
get an insight on the lines, ideals or
what-have-you on which it is con-
ducted. If this first day’s work suc-
ceeds in its ends, considerable bang-
ing of the typewriter will not have
been in vain. If it doesn’t succeed
in aid C, I shall law it to the general
dumbness that is common to all
freshmen (and, from the detached
view of one of my strenuous rusher
friends, to this year’s freshmen in
particular). So everything is rosy
all around, despite a faint greenish
tinge to the sky over Mandel.

This column last year specialized
in nothing but its conductor’s views,
if any. It was personal, and the
word “I,” scattered profusely
through its length and breadth, was
used against its conductor as the
basis for the charge that, perhaps,
he thought he was pretty good. Lest
the new freshmen fall into the error
of looking at things in this same
way, I repeat on this occasion the
defense I made a year ago. That
defense rests on the primary prin-
ciple that a column is, if anything,
no more than .the revelation of the
personality of its author, that it is
a clearing ground for his personal
opinions. Some readers may not
agree with those opinions; they may
not like them and they may say so.
Some, even, may only read the col-
umn every day for the purpose of
picking flaws in the logic of its
author, of confuting him, proving him
no more of an oracle than he should
be. Well, be this as it may. Just
so long as they READ it every day,
its conductor is satisfied.

Dean Boucher for

Honesty, Sincerity

You are now beginning a
period of life filled with perhaps
more possibilities for wholesome
development of mind and char-
acter than any other period of
similar length. All persons con-
nected officially with this institu-
tion are anxious to help you make
the most of the opportunities
offered. If you will do your part
honestly and earnestly your time
and ours will be spent with profit.

AMUSE FROSH

Plan ’ Novel Revue for
Annual Vodvil

Talented campus students have been
gathered to entertain entering fresh-
man women at the annual Vaudeville
to be given tonight at 8 in the theater
of Ida Noyes, under the auspices of
the Mirror.

Arrangements have been made for
an elaborate program, according to
Miriam Walker, business manager of
the Mirror. This will include Janet
Good, with a dancing specialty; Mau-
riette Dupre; a banjo act led by Dor-
othy Sylvester, and a number of sur-
prise skits about well-known campus
people. Clyde Keutzer, of Blackfriar
fame, will furnish the music for the
acts. Novel lighting effects have been
arranged.

Manuscripts for the second annual
performance of the Mirror are due the
first week of the quarter. They may
include a revue, a play, dr even a
farce, and may take place in any
country or period, with as few male
impersonations as possible, according
to Elizabeth Graham, president of the
organization. “Writing manuscripts
for the Mirror offers a fine opportu-
nity for authors, both on and off the
campus,’•Miss Graham continued. Per-
sons wishing to compete in the con-
test have been requested to give their
names to Miss Graham at Kenwood
house during the first week of the
quarter.

APPOINT T. V. SMITH

TO ASSIST BOUCHER

Prof. T. V. Smith of the depart-
ment of Philosophy has been ap-
pointed to the office of Associate
Dean of the Colleges of Arts, Liter-
ature and Science, according to an
official announcement from the dean’s
office. Three faculty members have
been chosen as deans to fill the va-
cancy left by resignations.

Mrs. Edith Foster Flint has re-
signed as dean in the Colleges in or-
der to devote more time to her of-

versity council. Miss Elizabeth Wal-
lace of the Romance department,
and Mr. Warder Clyde Allee, of the
department of Zoology have also ten-
dered resignations as deans, the for-
mer because of the length of her
service, the latter in order to con-
tinue his research work.

MICHELSON WILL
PROBE BASIS OF

EINSTEIN THEORY

Plans Repetition of ’83 Ex-
periments Next
December

Prof. A. A. Michelson, noted Uni-
versity physicist, who has returned “in
good health and high spirits” from a
summer in which he was occupied with
the measurement of the speed of light
on Mt. Wilson in Pasadena, Cal., an-
nounced this morning that the famous
Michelson-Morley experiment of 1883,
upon the negative results of which
Einstein based his celebrated theory
of relativity, would be repeated.on Mt.
Wilson next December.

The famous scientist said, also, that
he had obtained very satisfactory re-
sults in his work this summer, meas-
uring the speed of light as it traveled,
reflected back and forth by means of
a set of mirrors, from Mt. Wilson to
Mt. San Antonio* twenty-two miles
away. While Prof. Michelson is not
ready to-announce his results, it is ex-
pected that they will reveal a much
higher precision in the measurement
of light’s speed than has ever before
been recorded.

Perfect Apparatus

Experts are now at work in Pasa-
dena to perfect the interferometer
which the scientist will use when he
will conduct once more the world-
famous experiment which “involves
the problem of measuring the speed
of the earth and with it the whole
solar system through space.” The ap-
paratus will be the same type as that
used in the original experiment. How-
ever, certain improvements will be
added to insure greater accuracy. The
theory and apparatus utilized in this
experiment are rather complicated,
and at best, only a vague idea of their
significance and operation can be set
forth in non-technical language.

Expound Problems

Briefly, -the problem may be stated
a* follows. The sun, as it moves
through space, is carrying the earth
and the whole solar system with it.
Prof. Michelson argued that by means
of light, this motion could be deter-
mined.

It was supposed that the measure-
ment of the velocity of light in the
direction of this motion would be dif-
ferent from corresponding measure-
ment at right angles. The interfer-
ometer was devised in order to meas-
ure this difference, if it really existed.
The Michelson - Morley experiment
showed, however, contrary to previous
ideas, that the velocity of light is al-
ways the same in all directions. To
explain this, Einstein conceived the
theory of relativity.

Test Case

Recently, however, Prof. Dayton C.
Miller of the Case school in Cleveland
apparently arrived at a positive result
which, if confirmed, would be in con-
tradiction with Einstein's theory of
relativity. Prof. Michelson’s proposed
experiment next December will either
repeat the negative result he got some
years ago or will confirm the positive
result of Dr. Miller.

The purpose of the inteferometer
devised for the old Michelson-Morley
experiment is to divide a ray of light
into two parts, one of which travels at
right angle to the other. A piece of
glass thinly coated with silver set at
an angle of 45 degrees to the light
allows some of the light to go straight
through, but reflects the rest at a
right angle.

This instrument later proved of
value in a considerable number of
other investigations. Among these was
the establishment of the m^ter in
terms of light waves, undertaken by
Dr. Michelson in France at the re-
quest of the International Bureau of
weights and measures; and the ether-
drift experiment of 1924-25, which
studied the effect of the rotation of
the earth on the velocity of light.

Local Student
Is New National

Rifle Champion

Although not generally known, it
is none the less true that the long
range rifle championship of the
United States is held by an under-
graduate of the University. The
undergraduate’s name is Russell
Wiles, and although he only gained
this distinction this summer he is
used to championships and things of
that sort, for in 1923, at the age of
17, he was highest manon the United
States rifle team which won interna-
tional matches with England, Can-
ada, and Australia.

This summer drastic tryouts were
held for the American team which
finally lost to England in the inter-
national tournament. Sixty men were
at last eliminated, leaving the best
twenty-five to represent the United
States. Wiles stood fifth on the
American list.

Wiles is a sophomore at the Uni-
versity this fall and is pledged to
Phi Gamma Delta.

STUDENTS TO FILL
POSITIONS IN CHOIR

Placed are open in the University
Choir in all voices for both men and
women: second bassos are especially
welcome: the ability to read is desir-
able but not essential, and previous
vocal training is not required. Enter-
ing freshmen, who have four years
here, are particularly welcome.

The University Choir offers its
members a modest amount of pay, and

a considerable amount
pleasure and discipline,
“extra” performances for
come is listed a projected
bi-weekly broadcasting at

Freshmen entering the choir are of
especial value to the organization be-
cause of the longer service they can
give. They can secure for themselves
the advantage of singing most of that
time in the new chapel, already one of
the architectural landmarks of the
country.

Applicants may see me in Mitchell

HEADS OF BUSINESS
DEPARTMENT ISSUE
CALL TO FRESHMEN

Enterprising freshmen interested
in gaining business experience
through practical work on the busi-
ness staff of The Daily Maroon now
have opportunity to show their
worth, according to Charles Harris,
advertising manager, Harris says
that more than fifteen freshmen can
be given all the work they can han-
dle on this year’s staff, and that there
are chances that more men will be
able to find places later in the year.

The positions open to freshmen
on the business staff are not con-

fined
office
tising
many

to one department.- Routine
work, circulation, and adver-
all require the attention of
members of the business staff,

and among those concerned with
these three spheres are many fresh-
men* Freshmen need not confine
their activities to one of the business
departments alone, but in some cases
will be allowed to sell advertising
and work in the circulation depart-
ment at the same time.

Further Information may be ob-
tained at the Maroon office in Ellis

“BLUFF” INDICATIVE
OF INTELLIGENCE,
SAYS TEXAS PROF.

Bluffing grades almost imperceptibly
into intelligence, and must be taken
into consideration by the psychologist
in seeking to measure the mentality of
a man or woman, according to Prof.
F. A. C. Perrin, of the University of
Texas, who delivered lectures on per-
sonality at the University last summer.

The familiar intelligence tests, Prof.
Perrin went on to say, measure a sort
of intelligence, but do not truly depict
the “total person.”

The basic fact which impresses us
in a study of the actions of a human
individual in a group,” he asserted, “is
the seeking for adjustment, not in the
narrow biological sense only, but in

the sense of seeking after prestige, or
social success, or a better salary. And
we have to define intelligence as the
ability to make these social adjust-
ments.”

“When a student who is afraid of
flunking a course goes complaining to
the instructor, and, if a woman, per-
haps cries, he is exercising a form of
intelligence,” Mr. Perrin declared,“and
such things are not without effect.”

Real or assumed anger, gestures,
and all other means brought into play
in seeking the “adjustment” desired,
must be considered in evaluating “so-
cial intelligence” according to this
psychologist, and the individual’s con-
duct in the ball room or dining room
is as much a gau^e of this intelligence
as his conduct in the classroom.

TO FRESHMEN

II7E WELCOME you. The Daily Maroon, as the representative
’ * and the spokesman of the student body welcomes you into the
life of the university community. The members of the Daily Maroon
staff, in particular, greet you as fellow students.

You have chosen the University of Chicago for your school.
Almost necessarily, you come to it with a completely inadequate
understanding of its distinctive features. Many of you chose it for
the most trivial of reasons. Few of you had even a glimmer of an
idea about what it would do to you. But all of you felt that some
good would come of your decision. We think you were right.

You have been anticipating for many weeks the plunge into
this University life, the new environment, the complete shifting of
the scenery, the suddenly widened range of interests, the fresh sti-
mulations, the new loyalties. There is an element, too, of wonder in
this anticipation. We think that there is something wonderful about
the University.

You have chosen a school which is wonderful in its genuineness.
The superficialities common to the campus of many schools are here
reduced to a minimum. The collegiate shout and the collegiate
sneer, amusing enough, both of them, are by-products of adoles-
cence, and the University of Chicago is not adolescent in spirit.. Its
underlying spirit is rather one of genuine good-fellowship, tempered
by seriousness of purpose, and one of genuine dignity, tempered by
intelligent liberality.

We congratulate you. We hope that you have come here with
ideals, with a capacity for friendship, and with an appetite for the
austerity that makes for hard study and vigorous thinking. And we
wish you a happy and successful year.

The Parker Pen Company,
L Gentlemen:
FAt 4:10 P. M. yesterday I took off in
my Yackey plane from Checkerboard
field. When 1 reached an altitude of
3000 feet I leaned over the side and
dropped a Parker Over-size Duofold
Pen. A few minutes later I made a
landing near my starting point, and a
crowd was examining the same Parker
Duofold pen, which had landed on
hard ground. To my great surprise,
the pen had not been damaged in the
•lightest by its 3000 feet drop.

TTRESHMEN who wait two weeks before buying their text books
■*■ are invariably numbered among students in the lowest third of
the class. And by the same token freshmen who wait two weeks
before subscribing to The Daily Maroon are invariably numbered
among the “I didn't get a good start’s.”

The Daily Maroon is almost as essential to the freshman as his
text books. It is the only reliable daily medium for all of the news
on a great University campus. It covers every class of student and
activity accurately. The Daily Maroon is a source of rapidly grow
ing interest because it was founded solidly twenty-four years ago.

New features, new policies, new staff members, indicate that
the student newspaper will not be an idle boast this year. And inas-
much as we labor five days every week to give you a comprehensive
and interesting news coverage and since we believe that nothing suc-
ceeds like success we stand unqualifiedly in back of our product. And
we hope that you will recognize our faith; that you will sincerely
praise or censure at will, but most of all that you will give us a fight-
ing chance to demonstrate our worth by subscribing.

WHAT OF IT?

Z^HANGE is progress.

We think we have made a discovery but we don’t know what
you think. And since this is your newspaper—leads and heads—
we are asking you your honest opinion.
k “What of it?" you say.

And we come back with what of “What of it?”

We have changed it from the sport to the front page; we have
changed the content and we have tried to change the conductor.
The change has been made because we have many interesting fea-
tures for run-of-paper this year. We firmly believe that it deserves
front page position because it is going to chase the undergraduate
through school. We may be wrong although convinced that we’re
net.	,

Frosh Who Defy
Wise Men Expire

Without Plaudits

By Milton S. Mayer

Rushing — hazing — kidding the
kids—well here was one egg that was
going to give them the merry, merry
ha-ha. No foul and unsophisticated
rural lad was our man, not by a dam-
site. No, sir, Georgie was city bred
—and prep school besides.

Dawns Monday, Freshman Mon-
day. Dean So-and-So had said this,
and the President himself had said
that. But College really started
when the countless number of wild-
eyed neophytes, diamonds in the rough
(if at all) poured into the smoke-
dimmed cloister, reeking with the
smoothest men in the University—
“blah—blah—hello, old sport, I’m a
UNIVERSITY MARSHAL, . you
know, can’t I show you the sticks?”
—“blah, blah—blah—oh, I beg your
pardon, mister, but aren’t you from
Bedbug, Nebraska? I’m Bill Bolls,
from McHoehandleville, southern
part of the state—how are the
folks?”

And so on.

But not for Georgie. Georgie
blew into the fire and untenanted air,
and saw the campus for himself.
Days, and nights, passed, and
Georgie eluded the upperclassmen.
Tried out for The Daily Maroon, the
track team, an interview with the
President,—but they were all too
cocky, somehow; they all wanted to
show him how. And so on.

Georgie was graduated a Bachelor
of Philosophy four year later. He
was surrounded after convocation by
his mother, father, and one surviving
grandmother.

About fifty years later Georgie
died. They say he had to pull the
lid down on his own coffin.

And so it goes, and goes, and goes.
And there is a moral which only we
wise men, upperclassmen, know:
Heed the wise men, youngsters; they
have only evil to teach you, but with-
out that evil you will be—like
Georgie—Bachelors of Philosophy,
and, in time, so much clay.

It’s capable. A good point and a steady flow.
The Wahl Pen nib is made of iridium-tipped

It’s individual. You make your own choice of

THE DAILY MAROON, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1926

Mars to Near Earth In October;

Yerkes Observers Set Telescopes

Mars, ^ery red planet, enigma of
the skies, and possible dwelling place
of life—the planet that came so tan-
talizingly near the earth in July,
1924, only to slip away again with-
out revealing its secret, is going to
pay us another visit. Its coming is
known as an opposition, and the op-
position about to take place will be
more favorable than the one in 1924,
astronomers say.

The planet will be nearest the
earth, according to Prof. E. B. Frost
of the University of Chicago’s Yerkes
observatory, on October 27, when its
distance from the earth will be about
62,600,000 miles. The dates of the
opposition, (when Mars will be in the
opposite part of the sky from the
sun), is November 4. las nearest
distance will be about one-fifth great-
er than in 1924, but it will be about
thirty degrees further north, fifteen
degrees north of the celestial equator.

Favorable Conditions

Prof. Frost says that conditions at
this alutitude are much more favor-
able for observation than they were
at a lower altitude in 1924 when the
planet was a trifle nearer the earth.
At the time of the opposition, he
declares, Mars will rise about sunset,
cross the meridian about midnight
and set at about sunrise.

Mars Visible

“This is clearly the best time for
observing a planet,” the famous as-
tronomer continues, “for it will be
above the horizon the whole night.
During this autumn, Mars will be
visible above the horizon for about
fourteen hours nightly, instead of
about ten hours as in 1924. It will

Maroon Adds Unique

Petition to Archives

A recent addition to the Maroon
archives is a petition dated May 8,
1906, signed by 260 students calling
the atention of the University officers
to the necessity for reorganization of
The Daily Maroon.

R. F. Baldwin, who at one time at-
tempted to organize a rival paper,
found the petition in an old trunk
and sent it to The Daily Maroon last
summer. “The University Daily
News,” which he was to edit, was
vetoed by the late President Judson
just before he publication of the
first edition.

learned about Mars in 1924 was the
result of careful measurements of
the thermal radiation from the plan-
ets made at the Lowell observatory
at Flagstaff, Ariz., by Messrs. Co-
blentz and Lampland and at the Mt.
Wilson .observatory by Messrs. Pettit
and Nicholson. Perfect accordance
could not be expected for such dif-
ficult observations, but they indicated
that there was a great range of tem-
perature on the planet between day
and night, amounting at times to 200
degrees above zero. It was also
found that more heat came from the
darker portions of the planet, hither-

to believed by some to be water
swamps, than from the brighter
red parts commonly supposed to
desert sands. This is contrary

or
or

New Apparatus

A new apparatus for attachment
to the giant forty inch telescope at
the Yerkes observatory, which will

photograph the planet with a low
secondary magnification in different
colors, is now being perfected by
Prof. Ross of the observatory staff
who has taken it to Lick observatory
for tests under favorable conditions
during September and part of Oc-
tober. Prof. Ross will bring the in-
strument back to the Yerkes obser-
vatory for use during the Mars op-
position.

Explain Theory

Explaining the theory upon which
the apparatus is based Prof. Frost
says, “Important observations were
made at the Lick observatory of
Mars, and seemed to show a larger
diameter and different appearance of
the Polar cap with violet rays than
when the pictures were made with
with red rays. The explanation of
this was difficult. During the past
winter Prof. Ross experimented in
the laboratory of the Yerkes obser-
vatory in photographing in different
colors an electric lamp which took
the place of an artificial planet. Ht
found differences in the apparent
size depending on the kind of light
used in making the photograph. Such
observations of the real planet will
doubtless be repeated, and the true
explanation may, perhaps, be found.

Range of Temperature •

“The most important information

expectations and is not yet explained.
It seems that the temperature on
the planet’s surface at midday may
be well above the freezing point of
water, but except in the portion
warmed by the mid-night sun, the
temperature at night would be des-
perately low. This suggests that
even lichens or the hardiest moss
would find difficulty to live and grow
under such adverse conditions.”

NEW MEN VIE FOR VARSITY POSITIONS

Golf, Track, Horseshoe, Touchball, S wimming, On I~ M Schedule

HOWE ANNOUNCES
INTRAMURAL FALL
SPORTS PROGRAM

Touchball Opens Soon; Gala
Swim Carnival Ends

Autumn Bill

With a program touching every
field of fall sport, the intramural
commission plans one of the heaviest
schedules for the fall quarter that it
has ever attempted, according to a
statement made yesterday by John
Howe, general manager of intra-
mural sports.

Opening the second week of school
with “touch football” competition, the
schedule runs through a series of
horse shoe, track, and golf events un-
til the grand climax in December,
when the annual intramural swim-
ming carnival will close the quarters’
fraternity race for decorative cups to
adorn the traditional mantel piece.

Touchball Next Week

The modified football games will
begin as soon as the excitement of
fall rushing has subsided sufficiently
to give the Greek men an opportunity
to take stock of the available brawn
which must defend the honor of the
houses. Close on the heals of the
football games, Harry Hagey will
begin to whip into shape a sizeable
horseshoe pitching schedule.

Golf play will be run off in one
day, it is announced, and the cross?
country events will be set for a late
date in the quarter. Under the man-
agement of W. E. Wedell, the swim-
ming carnival will attempt to top off
in a grand manner, the fall quarter,
Howe states.

Fall Booklet Planned

The commission announces that
early next week the fall booklet with
a complete schedule of the sports, a
comprehensive history, and a number
of pictures of past events, will appear
on campus.

Organization of the commission
will not be entirely complete until
freshman candidates for commission
jobs, have appeared. A large number
of the newcomers will be added to the
present staff of workers, according
to Howe. The Freshmen will be giv-
en an opportunity to work for Sopho-
more jobs, which will lead to Junior
and Senior positions.

Staff Members

The present personnel of the com-
mission is: Dr. Molander, adviser;
John Howe, general manager; John
Meyer, field manager and sport sec-
retary; Arnold Johnson, fall sports
man; Gordon Wallace, winter; Lalon
Farwell, spring; W. E. Wedell, car-
nival manager and publicity man-
ager; Harry Hagey, Harry Ault,
Ralph McCormack, Donald Bell, and
Russell Whitney, Sophomore man-
agers.

Plans are already being formulated
for the annual fall banquet of the
department. This affair will be held
in the near future as a get together
for the members and to welcome the
new freshmen into the I-M staff.

yearungs report

EARLY, AVOID RUSH

Although Freshman Football
practice does not officially open un-
til next Friday, many anxious year-
lings have already reported and re-
ceived their uniforms. It is expect-
ed that ninety or more Frosh will
have reported by the end of the
week. They will be under the tute-
lage of Coaches Huntington, Stagg
Jr., and Fisher.

Ends and Backs
Captain Big Ten

Five of this year’s Big Ten cap-
tains are players of the end posi-
tion, while the other five are back-
field stars. Smith of Iowa, Kas-
sel of Illinois, Hogan of Purdue,
Wheeler of Minnesota and Sibley
of Indiana are all wing men of
merit, while Marks of Chicago,
Friedmand of Michigan, Harmon
of Wisconsin, Karow of Ohio, and
Baker of Northwestern are backs.

There is nothing unusual about
the selection of so many backfield
men, as that is a yearly occur-
rence. The development of the
passing game in modern football
circles has brought the end posi-
tion to the front and made it ri-
val the backfield in honors, which
probably accounts for the selec-
tion of so many wing men on this
year’s teams.

STAGG LEADS IN
UNSHARED TITLES

Only One Tie In Seven
Championship*

Chicago has won seven Conference
Championships in the history of Big
Ten football, the percentage basis be-
ing employed to compute the stand-
ing of the teams for each year from
1896 down to the present time. The
Maroons of ’99, ’05, ’07, ’08, ’13, ’22,
and ’24 were the title winners, and
all but one of these teams had a clear
stake to the championship. In 1922
a very strong Midway eleven shared
the title with two other undefeated
teams—Iowa and Michigan.

Michigan and Minnesota are strong
rivals for title honors. Although the
Wolverines have a record of nine
claims to the championship, no less
than six of these nine titles have been
shared with other teams by virtue of
ties in the standings for those years.
Likewise, the Gophers have been
forced to share a number of their
titles with other elevens. Out of
eight claims to the Championship,
only two have been “all-Gopher,” the
remaining six being ties with other
teams.

This analysis shows Chicago to be
way in the lead in the number of
clear cut and unshared claims to the
title. Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio and
Illinois have one or more clear-titled
championships, while Northwestern
boasts one triple tied claim to the
honor. Purdue and Indiana have no
championship years listed among
their respective pigskin accomplish-
ments.

Band to Perform
at Florida Game

Rehearsal of the University band
will start October 1, at 4:45. The
band will make its first appearance
this year at the Florida game.

Last year the band was enlarged
and presented with new uniforms. At
present there are many vacancies in
all instrument sections, trombonists
especially being in demand. All ap-
plicants for membership report at
the band locker room on the second
floor of the Stadium any afternoon
this week. Freshmen who have had
high school experience are urged to
apply.

COMMITTEE PLANS
FOR EFFICIENCY

IN TICKET SALE

Ticket* Plentiful far All
Games Except Illini
and Badger

By Roy Berkenfield

The annual scramble for those elu-
sive pasteboards has started. The
athletic department through the
Tickets Committee has made its
rules and regulations and believes
them to be good. The students, as
usual, will have their “C” books with
the attendant privileges.

Season tickets will be available to
alumni of the University and to the
general public for the six games
which are to be played on Stagg
field. These games are those with
Florida, Maryland, Purdue, Ohio
State, Illinois and Wisconsin. These
tickets will be sold for $14.17 for one
seat and $28.17 for two seats. There
is a limit of four seats to any one
person.

Where To Get Them

Public sale of tickets for each
game will open on the Monday pro-
ceeding the game. They will be on
sale at the stadium office at 5625 El-
lis avenue on the second floor of the
west stand. Tickets will also be sold
at the A. G. Spalding store and at
Marshall Field and Company’s store
for men. For those who have not
been able to secure the needed paste-
boards there will be some for sale
at the gates of Stagg Field on the
day of the game.

In case advanced applications for
any game exhaust the supply of tic-
kets announcements of that fact will
be made by the Tickets Committee
through the Daily Maroon and other
papers. It is expected that there will
be no shortage of tickets except for
the Illinois-Chicago, and the Wiscon-
sin-Chicago games. Tickets to all of
the other games will be available to
all comers up to the time of the
game.

The Price*

Ticket prices and the date of the
close of applications for the various
games are as follows—Florida,
$1.50, September 20; Maryland, $1.50,
September 27; Pennsylvania at Phil-
adelphia, $3.00, October 4; Purdue,
$2.50, October 11; Ohio State, $2.50,
October 11; Illinois, $3.00, October
18, Northwestern at Evanston, $3.00,
October 25; and Wisconsin, $3.00,
November 1.

Every effort will be made by the
Athletic department to prevent tic-
kets from falling into the hands of
scalpers and speculators.

MARKS DROPS OLD
NUMBERING SYSTEM
FOR PAIR OF 5’S

Captain Wally Marks, pictured
above, will be distinguished in the
games this year by a large “55.”
At a banquet tendered last year’s
team by the Fifty-Fifth Street Busi-
ness Men’s Association, the Toast-
master, Mr. William J. Hayes, stated
that it would be a fitting commem-
oration of the banquet for Marks to
wear the number 55 on his sweater
during the coming season. He also
hoped that Marks’ 55 would become
as famous as the “77” of Red
Grange. Marks, in a speech, ac-
cepted the honor and will wear the
“55” on his Maroon jersey instead
of the customary number one.

It won’t be long now. The new
north stand at Stagg Field is nearly
completed, and by Friday the work-
ingmen should pack up their tools.
Perhaps the most important feature
of Chicago’s new stadium is the addi-
tion of nearly double the number of
good seats. It is anticipated that
practically all the season ticket hold-
ers will be seated in this new north
stand as it holds more than 23,000
people. As it is, nearly one half
this great structure has been reserved
for public season ticket holders.

On the south, temporary seats have
been erected, while the wooden stands
have been moved to a position over-
looking the east end of the field, mak-
ing the total capacity for the Flor-
ida game about 50,000. Later on ex-
tra seats will be erected for the Il-
linois and Wisconsin games making
it possible for 55,000 people to crowd
within the gates of Stagg Field be-
fore the end of the season.

The new press stand located on the
top of the now north stand affords
press accommodations for nearly
double the number of reporters who
were accommodated last year. The
new press box will be sppplemented
by the old box on the west stand,
and in addition to these press accom-
modations there are four radio
booths, making this new press stand
so far as known the largest and best
equipped in the country, exceeding
any in the Big Ten.

Filling the quarterback and the two
tackle positions and the problem of
whether to shift Capt. Wally Marks
to fullback, his natural position, are
the most serious difficulties facing A.
A. Stagg as he begins his thirty-fifth
year as Maroon football coach. Marks
was played at half last year mainly
because there were plenty of full-
backs around, and not so many good
halfbacks. He was steady, if unbril-
liant, at the position, but he’d prob-
ably go better at full.

Marks is a bucker, and his defensive
play would fit in well with a fullback’s
job backing up the line. John Mc-
Donough, a cool and reliable man,
with some fire, is heading the list for
quarter right now. He is an all-around
worker, without special ability as a
ball carrier, but a good passer and
blocker. Macklind, a shifty but light
man, and Fulton, an entirely capable
player, are other generals.

Many Tackles

Cameron and Weislow, both up near
190 pounds in weight, are liked pretty
well by the coaches for tackles, but
the fight isn’t over, by a long shot, yet.
Borden, 200, a reserve guard last sea-
son, Cochran, a big squad man for
two years, and Lewis, about 190 and
aggressive, are all possibilities to start
against Florida Saturday. Garen, green

OPEN STUDENT "C”
BOOK APPUCATIONS

Students may secure “C” books by
making application at the office of
the Football Tickets Committee be-

tuition receipt in order to obtain the
coveted book.

All applications from today until
noon Saturday, Oct. 9 will be ac-
cepted, but it is urged that students
apply early as all C book applica-
tions after the first 2,300 may be re-1
stricted as to use during the basket- j
ball season. The office is located at
5625 Ellis Avenue, in the stadium.
The price is the same as in former
years—ten dollars per book.

and not so heavy, has been playing
hard, and he, toe, may be a starter

If Marks is kept at halfback, “Rud-
dy” Leyers, stocky sophomore from
Lindblom high school, appears the
best bet for the fullback position. Ley-
ers is built close to the ground and is
nimble on his feet for a 178-pounder.
Libby, from Evanston, likewise a
sophomore, whose work as a fearless
interferer attracted the coaches’ at-
tention last week, is being groomed
as substitute fullback.

Stan Rouse Stars

Stan Rouse gradually appears as the
rising star in the 1926 Maroon back-
field. A fast, powerful runner, employ-
ing dodge and change of pace effec-
tually, a fair forward passer and the
best punter on the squad. Rouse has
stood out distinctly in the early prac-
tices. He weighs 180 pounds this fall
and is in tip-top condition.

Kyle Anderson and Bert McKinney,
substitutes last fall, are staging a close
duel for the other halfback job. Mc-
Kinney has the edge as to speed and
experience, but Anderson’s passing
and kicking may prove invaluable to
the team.

The battle for the tackle assignments
is the most interesting. Not a veteran
reported for that position and Coaches
Jackson and Henderson, two of the
greatest tackles in Maroon history, have
been driving the candidates at a terrific
clip.

Sophs Show Fight

Last week with the advent of scrim-
mage a trio of ambitious sophomores,
pseudo tackles, Weislow, Garon, and
Cameron, went on a rampage and
mussed up plays repeatedly. Though
all three are green, because of their
fighting ability they should develop
rapidly.

The Maroons appear well-fortified at
guard this season. Wolff, 195 pounds,
and Neff, 235 pounds, veterans, should
get the first call as regulars. Wolff,
especially, with his speed and strength,
should have a great year. Cochran,
Clark, and Heitman have all had ex-

perience and have shown to advantage
in the early scrimmage.

Ken Rouse, who developed rapidly
toward the end of last season, is the

oustauding center candidate. Olwin
and Small have not shown much, to
date.

At end, Laury Apitz has developed
remarkably. A safe, defensive player,
fine blocker, and a promising forward-
pass receiver, he bids fair to blossom
into a star wingman. Bob Spence, who

came up to the varsity this fall with a
fine freshman and prep school record,
has not disappointed.

Fouche, who has been out Qi school
since the 1919 season, and Hoerger, 195-
pound basketball guard, have been given
considerable time by the coaches lately.
Krogh and Stickney are still laid up with

bumps received in the first scrimmage
of the season.

The Maroons are not taking the Uni-
versity of Florida contest lightly. Flor-
ida's only two defeats last season were
administered by Alabama and Georgia
Tech, two of the strongest teams in the
country. Then, too, the defeat by Mis-

souri in the opening game of the 1924
season is still fresh in the minds of
Coach Stagg and the veterans on this
year’s team. Florida has been practicing
for this game since the first of Sep-
tember, and made a creditable showing
in her game with Southern last Satur-
day, which was won by Florida, 13 to 0.

FRESHMAN WEEK

Jack and Joe went off to school—
And met a college grafter;

Jack fell for his pledging talk
And Joe came tumbling after.

HE came up to us and smiled
confidently, “Huh, those Seniors
can’t play any of these high school
tricks on me. Can you imagine one of
them telling me to take the elevator
in Harper?”

AFTER a whole summer of neg-
lect our contribution box revealed a
special delivery letter addressed to
an A. J. Mallory which had been
dropped in there by some dumb mail-
man. In order to escape any further
mistakes (gum wrappers, etc.) we
announce now that the Whistle box
just outside of the Maroon office is
reserved and dedicated to campus
people and college concoctions. Con-
tribs may be sent care of The Daily
Maroon via the Faculty Exchange
mail boxes.
