I have a better system for setting
up a local Who’s Who. Times, you
mu-t admit, have changed since it was
the thing to do to gape at the Potter
Palmer castle on the Drive. The old
order ha- changed. No member of
the Chicago Four Hundred cracks the
bottle over anything when a Food
Shou or an Elks’ Convention opens in
Chicago (as Mrs. Palmer did, when
the lid blew off the World's Fair). No,
a bathing beauty selected at the Bala-
ban and Katz Norshore or Central
Park (3690 West Roosevelt Road) does
tin business instead. And so with ev-
erything. The old families don’t rate

It is expected that Dr. Gilkey’s
views on student leadership will be sup-

James Cusack. Wendell Bennett and
John Howe, who w ill present the view

This question of the disinterest of
the average student in regard to af-
fairs of national prominence, has be-
come a leading one throughout the
country as a whole and this evening's
discussion ought to throw some light
on it.

One-eyed Connelly believes “it pays

and special messenger of Head Gate-
man Shafer, with his calling card. The
modest Irishman has had his official)
title, “One-eyed Connelly, World's
Champion Gate Crasher,” delicately
engraved in 24 point type on a brilliant
pink card. On the opposite side one
finds sundry information as to why
an Irishman resembles a monkey, a
parrot, a whiskey keg, and a cow yard.

One-eyed Connelly has crashed his
way into world’s champion boxing
matches, baseball matches and what
not, but he failed to throw' the ef-

EVERYBODY’S ACTING”

THE GENIAL CAPTAIN of the University of Sydney debating
* team remarked on last Tuesday evening that one of our de-
baters had laid a “sound” basis for his argument. “It was very
sound,” said he, “in fact, all sound.” But behind this good-natured
banter there lies a profound truth. When university men travel half-
way round the globe to debate with us whether the results of the
Great War have tended toward the peace of the world or not, they,
together with our own debaters, are laying a “sound” foundation for
international understanding, friendship, and hence for peace. It
matters little just what arguments are brought forth pro and con
the question at issue. It matters hardly at all which side wins. What
does matter, and matter tremendously, is that university students
from the ends of the earth should meet, exchange viewpoints,
share ideas, and part friends.

And the fact that we happen to speak the same
joy the same cultural heritage as our visitors from
increases rather than dimishes the significance of such
For Leagues and World Courts notwithstanding, it

tongue and en*
“down under ’
an interchange,
is the English-

speaking nations after all which have the peace of the world largely
in their own hands. Let us by all means have more “sound’ basis
for that peace.

MICHIGAN AGAIN

HACK IN 1920 we played our last game of football with the Uni-
U versity of Michigan. During the last six years we have played
no football with Michigan, and we have had little enough of any
athletic competition with the Ann Arbor men. Now again we re-
sume relations. Mr. Stagg has signed a four year football contract
with the Michigan Director of Athletics.

The reason for the six year lapse is probably one which is in-
herent in the difficult task of schedule making. There has been
much discussion of “why we don’t play Michigan,” and there have
been theories, many of them hinging on the idea of bad feeling
between the two schools. And there have been many theories, ad-
vanced by those who have “inside information,” about the reason
for the bad feeling.

Mr. Stagg has definitely spiked the bad feeling rumor. The
University of Chicago, impeccable in athletic reputation, has always
had rather an easy time arranging its schedule, because everyone
wants a game with Chicago. Mr. Stagg is a wise and courageous
schedule maker. If he has not chosen to play Michigan during the
last six years it is because there was no place for Michigan in the
well-rounded seasons which he anticipated.

The alumni and the student body of the University are glad that
Michigan is again on our schedule. The Michigan game in the past
has always been one of the high points of the football season. It
has always been a hard-played, clean, fighting game. There has
always been a full stadium.

We are much pleased.

Even Oxford furtively raises a -
beckoning finger to the promising *
prep school athlete. The famous ■
practice of enticing embryo athletes I
with scholarships and lowered en- !
trance requirements can no longer 11
be charged up to American schools j |
alone.

Brazenos, one of the colleges at
Oxford, after a long period of ath
letic supremacy, is in line for a
slump due to the exposing of under-
hand methods. The college has re-:
sponded vigorously to the thrusts
of the newspapers but the news has
swept over London and Oxford J

Psi Upsilon, . last year's pigskin
champions moved one step nearer a
repetition of the same feat when they
downed the Alpha Belts to the time
of 12-0 in a fast semi-final touchhall
game yesterday. Gordon and Libby
starred, as usual, for the winners,
while Armstrong and Kell* proved the
highlights from Alpha Delta Phi.

Phi Sigma Delta mowed down Tau
Delta Phi by the lopsided count of
18-0. At tl e start of the game short
passes by the winners put the ball on
tl e 5 yard line bu they were unable to
push it over. The first tally came
when Berles intercepted a pass and ran
20 yards for a touchdown. Six more
points were added on a twenty yard
pass, and the final score was turned
in by Edelstein after a series of short
passes.

Clark Stars

Delta Upsilon overwhelmed Sigma
Nu, 30-0. Clarke of the winners was
all over the field, making 18 of his
team’s points.

He intercepted a pass and galloped
50 yards for the first touchdown, and
after receiving a pass .dove across the
line for the second one. The winners
showed a marked superiority all
through the game.

In the slowest of the day’s elimina-

score was made b) H. Hoffman after

Captain-ball season ended Nov. 23rd.
A dinner was held that night for the

Alma Wiley, instructor in physical
education.

The winning teams were: first, th’e
Crack-shots; second, the Quakers;
third, the Galloping Guses; and fourth,
the Red Hots. Everyone on these
teams received points toward W. A.

Intersectional Battle With
Penn Here On

Oct. 22nd

Coach A. A. Stagg again emerged
from the annual Big Ten Schedule
making conference with a prize assign-
ment for his next year's grid warriors
when he met the Coaches and officials
of other Big Ten schools last Friday.

The schedule for 1627 is a knockout.
So far it includes conference games
with six teams and an important inter-
sectional struggle with The University
of Pennsylvania: one more contest is
to be scheduled soon for the open date
of October 1st. the initial Saturday
of the. official season. The schedule
is as follows:

Oct. 1st—Open date, at Chicago.

Oct. 8th—Indiana, at Chicago.

Oct. 15th—■Purdue, at Chicago.

Oct. 22nd—Pennsylvania, at Chi-
cago. -,

Oct. 29th—Ohio State, at Columbus.

Nov. 5th—Michigan, at Chicago.

Nov. 12th—Illinois, at Urbana.

Nov. 19th—Wisconsin, at Chicago.

The above arrangement speaks for
itself. An outstanding item is the game
with Michigan scheduled for November
5th. This is the first of a four game
series and will usher in the revival of
an old rivalry as strong as any tradi-
tional struggle on the Maroon sched-
ule.

Breaking off relations with North-
western in order to place Pat Page
and his Indiana eleven on the sched ।
ule is another feature of the 1927
menu. The game between- Stagg, the
old teacher, and Page, his. former pu-
pil, will rival the one between Stagg
and Yost, the Grand Old Man of
Western Football, in interest.

Six conference ' games, more than
any other school scheduled, is a third
factor which makes this schedule a
good one. Most of the schools have
five games, while Minnesota had it'
usual difficulty in getting the four
which are required, as did Indiana.

SCRIMMAGE FOR
MIDWAY GAGERS

As a preliminary to the strenuous
workouts that will be inaugurated
during the coming weeks, Coach Nor-

basketball honors through a hard
scrimmage, last night in Bartlett gym.
The Maroons will meet the Oak Park
Y. M. C. A., in a practice game, on
Dec. 11th.

The squad now consists of the fol-
lowing men, forwards: Zimmerman,
Kaplan, Gist, Cooper, Macklind and
Meskimon; centers, Capt. Sackett,
Koerber, Youug and Black, guards;
Hoerger, McDonough, Farwell, Laver-
ty, K. Rouse, Murphy Mudge and Cut-
ter. Of the new material Gist and
Kaplan are showing exceptionally fine
form, and are sure to provide stiff com-
petition for the regulars who are back
from last year.

The Maroon eagers are in for some
hard work as only a short time re-
mains until the opening of the con-
ference season which will take place
on Jan. 8th with the University of
Iowa, here.

Many of the other conference
coaches have been drilling their squads
since school started, and Coach Nor-
gren must work hard to overcome this
handicap. He is bent on instilling the
necessary fundamental plays into the
players, before he puts them through
the gruelling drill in preparation for
the coming season.

New Captain Has Enviable
Record; A Chicago
Product

Ken Rouse will be the captain of the
1927 Chicago football team He was
elected yesterday noon at a meeting
attended by every football player who
played in any of the Maroon games
of the past season. On the prelimin-
ary ballots the votes were split be-
tween Rouse, McDonough, Anderson
and Wolff, with Rouse slightly in the
lead, but on the final .ballots every vote
was cast for him.

Is Optomistic

When he was told that the honor
of piloting the next year's team had
been conferred upon him. Ken made
the following statement: “I certainly
am very, proud of the trust which the
boys have placed with me. I've been
looking forward to coming to the Uni-
versity of Chicago and playing on Mr.
Stagg's team ever since my freshman
days in high school. Even though we
have a stiff schedule we are going to
have a strong team that will win all of
our games next year and Im elated at
the opportunity to lead it."

List Honors

Rouse has an enviable record of foot-
ball honors. This year he has been
sharing the center position on practi-
cally every ‘All-Conference’ team with
Reitsch of Illinois and Klein of Ohio
State. During his senior year at Lind-
blom High he was captain of his team
and when he entered the university
and played on the freshman team of
1924 his teammates again awarded him
the same responsibility. He was the
only sophomore on last year’s team
to win his major C.

He is a member of Iron Mask, Skull
and Crescent, and so far has a Phi
Beta Kappa average in his scholastics.
He is the second member of Sigma
Nu fraternity to receive the captaincy
in the last two years.

NOW that examinations are draw-

told to us by a math professor a few
years ago. It seems that this profes-
sor was teaching down at Georgia
Tech at the time of the story and one
ot his brother profs had a football
player in his class. The man was a
valuable fullback but he had been in-

The day of examination ar-

with a fishing-line, hook and

questions and then left tl e room. The
football player put the examination

A smoking pleasure that never fails

HERE is the outstanding fact of
the entire cigarette industry:
Camels never tire the taste, no mat-
ter how liberally you smoke them;
never leave a cigaretty after-taste.

Only the choicest tobaccos that
nature produces, only the finest
blending ever given a cigarette
could produce a smoke that never
fails to please, that always brings
the utmost in smoking enjoyment.
Regardless of how often you want
the comfort of a smoke, of how
steadily you light one after another,

Camels will never fail you, never
give you any but the finest thrill of
smoking pleasure.

That is why Camel sales, by far
the largest in the world, keep over*
whelmmgfy in the lead. Increasing
millions are discovering the incom-
parable Camel quality — smooth-
ness and mellowness.

If you want the one and only
cigarette that’s good to live with
strenuously from morn to mid-
night— the cigarette that never
tires the taste — Have a Camel!
