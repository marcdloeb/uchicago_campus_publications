Alumnus States
Own Impressions
Of Campus Life

Complaints against many- campus
fraternities were made yesterday- by
F. J. Gurney, assistant recorder, who
charged that the Greek societies are
not good sports, do not co-operate,
and are careless and unbusiness like.

“Some of the fraternities, indeed,”
said Mr. Gurney, “are very careful
and exact in making out and sending in
their lists and in all their dealings
with the recorder’s office. Some are
businesslike. But there are many
others which are lax, careless, and un-
businesslike. Instead of returning
their lists within a week, as requested,
they drag along indefinitely and have
to be dunned again and again. Even
so, one fraternity did not bring in its
list for the Autumn quarter until about
two weeks after the opening of the
Winter Quarter, and last year two
fraternities sent in lists for only two
quarters.

Names Indistinct

"Names are frequently written so
indistinctly that it is difficult to iden-
tify them, or they are misspelled, or
only the middle name is written instead
of both given names, or a nickname is
given instead of the real name. Some-
times names are omitted entirely, and
that to the detriment of the fraternity
itself.”

Mr. Gurney mentioned two cases in
which a fraternity lost the benefit of
very high marks through filling out a
blank list incorrectly. He called at-

to a testimonial in the
cnce Monthly magazine
is quoted as saying:

“The ‘Original’ Arch

STUDENT COMMITTEE
SEEKS CO-OPERATION
IN FRIENDSHIP DRIVE

To give foreign students a chance to
help themselves in a spirit of friendly
internationalism is the aim of the Stu-
dent Friendship drive, soon to be con-
ducted under the leadership of Jeannette
Hayward and Harry May, co-chairmen.

“The unrest which follows war is al-
ways disastrous to the educational sys-
tem of a country. Students all over
Europe are struggling to reconstruct
from the educational debris the wonder-
ful university system which existed
there before the war. Conditions in
America are not such as to bring to the
minds of American students the needs
of the youth of other countries, where
neither the financial ability of the family,
nor the funds of the large universities
are sufficient to provide education to all
who seek it,” said Miss Hayward.

These students do not wish charity-
only a chance to help themselves. And
giving them this chance is what Amer-
ican students have been doing for the
past five years through the medium of
the Student Friendship bund, and which
with student co-operation they will con-
tinue to do.

The folowing have been asked to meet
today at 4 in Classics 10: Walter Schaef-
fer, Harold Schwede, Seymour Edelson,
Sarah Billingslea, Jack Cusack, Harry
Axon, Elva Brown, Laura Reynolds and
Helen Herlihy.

Along with the testimonial and full
page advertisement is a cut of the
blonde athlete with pigskin clutched
under his arm and jaw set. “Foot-
ball player discovers new way to end
foot pains in ten minutes,” reads the
headline, under which the virtues
merits of the ‘Original’ brace are
fully explained and illustrated.

SEATS ON SALE
FOR PLAYFEST

Fraternities and Clubs Buy
Tickets in Blocks

Seats for The Playfest, the Dramatic
association's annual benefit production to
be presented in Mandel hall Feb. 5 and
6, are now'on sale in Mandel cloister.

The tickets are going rapidly, accord-
ing to Donald Dodd and Holmes Boyn-
ton, who are in charge of the sales. Al-
though a number of choice seats remain,
the business staff predicts that the house
will be sold out for both evenings by
the end of the week, because of the
numerous reservations of blocks of seats.

Campus clubs and fraternities are
purchasing blocks, and the social organ-
izations interested in the Settlement and
Day Nurseries, for which The Play fest
is being given, are planning parties for
the evening.

Miss Eleanor Metzel, who has long
been prominent in the association, has
been placed in general charge of the di-
rection, under the supervision of Frank
O’Hara, director of student activities.
Miss Metzel is now rehearsing the three
plays.

lunched with the Prince and who later
showed him through the Ryerson phy-
sical laboratory were: Prof. Michelson,
Prof. II. G. Gale, Prof. A. H. Compton,
of the physics department; Prof. W. A.
Nitze, of the French department, and
Prof. C. D. Buck, famous philologist.

The Prince stated that he was inter-
ested to discover that instead of a Uni-
versity of class rooms as he had ex-
pected, he found a University where ac-
tual experiments to determine the com-
position of matter were in progress. He
expressed himself as pleased with the
Gothic atmosphere of the University
buildings.

Prince Paul was characterized by
Prof. A. H. Compton as “a very well-
informed layman.”

Unless his condition is unexpectedly
retarded, Dean Wilkins will leave the
hospital within the next ten days, and
return to the University soon there-
after.

This is the prospect of Mr. Wil-
kins’ convalescence, according to a
report made early today by Dr. E.
C. James, assistant at the Presbyter-
ian Hospital to Dr. Herman L.
Kretschmer, under whose care the
patient is rapidly improving.

“Mr. Wilkins rested unusually
comfortably today,” continued the
interne. “He was able to sit up and
read the newspapers and, for a short
time, peruse a book. He has now
reached the pinnacle of his condition.
His strength has returned and his
spirits have become lighter.

“We expect a steady convalescence
from now on, and no further internal
trouble is probable.”

Dean Wilkins underwent a slight
operation Monday morning, from
which he recovered rapidly. The
operation apparently has wrought no
bad effects on his general condition.

“Why I believe in the Bible” will be
explained by Dr. J. M. P. Smith at the
weekly- Fellowship meeting of the Y. M.

fessor of Old Testament literature in the
Divinity school. All men of the Uni-

their opiinons.

Special musical numbers have been
arranged for the Y. M. C. A. open house
which will be held tomorrow from 4 to
6 in the South Lounge of the Reynolds
clubhouse. Maurice Schraeger, violinist,
and Jean Mack, pianist, of the South-
more hotel orchestra, and Qyde Keut-
zer, baritone, will present several num-
bers between 4 and 5.

This is the first long musical program
of the year planned for entertainment at
the weekly open house. Following the
musical numbers refreshments will be
served. The Y. M. C. A. extends a wel-

“English women are all interested in
outdoor sports. We play cricket, hockey,
and net ball all year around. The last
game is much like basketball, but does
not have a back-board. Ice skating and

we do not have outdoor rinks."

Miss Clarke has been in the United
States since August, and plans to return
to England next July.

which can now be asked of him is:
“What have you learned?” And since
The Maroon desires an answer to the

question, this graduate student

CAP AND GOWN
CLOSES DRIVE

Announces Final Date to Buy
Under Present Plan

The Cap and Gown will conclude its
present sales drive on February 19, it
was announced yesterday- by Charles
Eckstein, of the year book board of
control, and John Hopkins, business
manager. The termination of the cam-
paign was set after the sales persons
and business staff compared notes wit
the editorial department and decided
the date on which final preparations
for the volume would have to be made.

Until that date students may- pur-
chase the book on the partial payment
plan now being used. A payment of
$1.00 procures the hook, if the re-
maining $3.50 is paid before March
10. If the student fails to pay the

even any subordinate part of such a
subject. He is not a whit better mathe-
matician, or physicist, or linguist, than
at the time when, almost too gener-
ously, the university granted him the
degree of A. B. He was always one
of the worst possible students of the
sciences, and must now record, with
some regret, that he will never actual-
ly know anything about those things.

Finds Terminology Confusing

Another field in which the p. g.
student Jhas conspicuously 'failed is
master of the organization side of uni-
versity affairs: Those things express-
ed in terms like “required credit,”
“major and minor sequence,” "systems
of grading,” and so on. The alumnus
has several times been almost drowned
in a surf of terminology wherein even
freshmen bathe with complete ease.
He has saved himself and his self-
respect only by realizing that the
deans, recorders and examiners would
flounder just as badly if they- were in
a newspaper office and heard the re-
mark, “Say, pep up that double-
slugged head in the dummy.”

Yet, the alumnus, he who at times

Henry Justin Smith, assistant to the
president, and director of public rela-
tions for the University, has resigned
to accept an editorial position on the
Chicago Daily News, it was announced
yesterday. Mr. Smith’s resignation be-
comes effective Saturday, January 30,
and he expects to take up his duties on
the News about February 8 or 9, he
states.

Mr. Smith was formerly city editor,
and later news editor of the Daily
News. He came to the University in
July, 1924. At that time it was felt
that the University had reached a
point where there was a need of in-
terpreting itself to the public more
fully.

Secured As Newspaper Man

It was thought that an experienced
newspaper man of sound opinions and
good methods could accomplish this
purpose. Accordingly Mr. Smith was
secured for the task. In addition to
his work in connection with the uni-
versity itself, he has been in charge
of publicity for the Development Fund
drive.

Aside from his long journalistic ca^
reer, Mr. Smith is well known for his
books, among which "Deadlines” is
one of the best known. As indicated
by the title, this is a book with a
newspaper background. 'Other works
of Mr. Smith are “The Other Side of

the Wall,”

the Way It’s Writ-

ten,” and “Josslyn.”

Graduated In 1898

Mr. Smith is an alumnus of the Uni-
versity of Chicago, having been gradu-
ated in the class of 1898. From 1901

has even been addressed as “professor” I to 1913 he was city editor of the

and has been still further thrilled by
envelopes calling him “doctor,” must
have learned something in a year and

a

half.

If so,

Well,

what?

Sees Friendly Spirit

for one thing, he has learned

that the spirit of the University is
noticeably, definitely, friendly. This
was a very early discovery. The alum-

Chicago Daily News, and after that,
until he took charge of the university
public relations, he was news editor of
The News.

The department of public relations
will be continued, it is stated, but no
announcement of a successor to Mr.
Smith has been made.

Marks Takes Lead in Man Hunt;

Hobscheid Sinks to Second Place!

By George Morgenstern

Walter Emil Marks, handsomest
man in the Sigma Nu house (and that
includes Al Widdifield, too.) has at
xast got out in front where he is said
(we are cautious) to belong in this
here Campus Apollo contest. "Vred"
Hobscheid, whose demure wistfulness
has been pulling in the votes in such
heavy quantities all these past days,
has at last sunk down to second place,
where the better element in the com-
munity hopes he will stay.

Austin McCarty entered the running
in the course of the day. suddenly poll-
ing 180 votes. “The rigorous course of
training I underwent in Paris last
summer,” says Mr. McCarty, “has
made me ‘interesting’ in the eyes of
the women. Besides, you can t keep
a good man down.” The withdrawal
of Mr. Wallie Williamson, rommate
of Mr. McCarty at the Phi Gam
house, is not believed to have anything
to do with brother Austin’s sudden
rise to fame and, possibly, fortune.

Hamlet or the last of the Mohicans or
something, was another new entry.
Mr. Abbott’s (we shall not say Greek)
nose was the magnet that pulled 109
votes—heavy- work, it might be said,
for one single sniffer. Doc Bratfish,
the independent candidate, when noti-
fied of Abbott’s strong following, went
away- muttering something about “it
looks like machine politics again!”
Later on. when interview in cold blood
in the Reynolds Club barber-shop, Mr.
Bratfish said, “I am the Romans’ entry-
in this contest, but I ain’t got a Ro-
man nose. That’s al! that keeps me
from being there at the top.”

nus must confess that, like many oth-
ers, he had drifted into the miscon-
ception that universities—any and all
of them—were places whose very walls
wore a dyspeptic frown. He imagined
that the conduct of classes involved
a tyranny and an ill temper which, as
a matter of fact, is often found in
business life—but never here. Now,
there may be students who still cling
to the great misconception, but surely
there can’t be many! The present
postgraduate-student-at-large begs to
testify that he has found this university
an amiable, an encouraging, a—well,
a smiling sort of place. A beautiful
one, of course, too. A region of lovely
shadows and alluring lighted windows
—but there isn’t space to go into that.

“All Work and No Play.” The con-
sequences you know.

It has indeed been a sorry outlook
these few weeks when there is only
work to write about and no play. Mrs.
Merrill’s register is just so many sheets
of blank paper dated to relieve the
bleakness, but as exciting in content
as a sleepy political economy course.

It was only a week since I heard
class officers in great dispute as to
when it would be possible to have a
Freshman-Sophomore prom, a mixer,
or luncheon in this busy whirl of
society. Just impossible was the cry
to find a free or open date.

Bleak Outlook

It is unfortunate to look so far into
the future that one becomes blind to
the present which is in dire need of a
prom or so as an impetus to the
sphere.

Plans are plentiful, plans for great,
gala, grandeurs are calling for a lot
of work but no play.

Catharine Campbell. Paul Cullom,
Graham Kernwein, and Lucy Lamon
meet every day to work with Prom so
that there will be “play” on Feb. 19.

"Greek Drama” wil be the subject of
an address to be given by Miss Gertrude
Smith, associate professor in the Greek
department, at the meeting of the Li-
terary Club tomorrow at 8 in Harper
M-ll. A short tplk on the poetry of
James Branch Cabell will be given by
Samuel Levin.

Among the future speakers of the club
is Dean Gordon J. Laing, of the Latin
department. The requirement for be-
coming a member of this organization
is a fifteen hundred word essay on any
literary subject.

Dr. J. M. P. Smith, professor of Old
Testament in the Divinity School will
lead the discussion on “Why I Be-
lieve in the Bible” which will be the
subject of the weekly fellowship meet-
ing of the Y. M. C. A. today at 4:30
in Room A of the Reynolds clubhouse.

The scenery committee of the Mirror
will meet at 2:30 in Cobb hall. Eliza-
beth Gordon will preside.

OUR CRITICISM

WE have delayed giving the undergraduate council our critic-
isms of the University. It is too late now. Only one thing
remains for us to do. We will print them.

The University needs:

(1)	Closer and more individual guidance of undergraduates
by the faculty.

(2)	A stronger chapel service.

(3)	A bureau that can determine for what job a student is
best fitted, help him to prepare for that job, and find the job for
him.

(4)	More direct, personal instruction in physical culture.
This will make the present mechanical rules largely unnecessary

(5)	More contacts between graduate and college students.

(6)	Residence halls for all students, to take the place of fra-
ternity and rooming houses. Students should live together; but
the fraternity house, always trying to outdo its neighbors in lux-
uriousness, is too expensive.^

(7)	National sororities, as a means toward greater democracy
among men and women.

(8)	Social affairs of a sort that will promote greater friendli-
ness among more undergraduates.

(9)	Better publications: Make The Daily Maroon more inter-
esting, more accurate, and more informative; put later news and
more worthwhile information into the Cap and Gown; make The
Phoenix something besides a college comic—a Chicago comic;
abandon The Circle as a plant not adapted to our soil.

(10)	A stronger and more lasting organization of alumni.

(11)	Prompt and courteous service by employees in the book*
store, the information office, the elevators, and the telephone
exchange.

(12)	More books (both duplicates and new titles) in the
libraries. A longer period for the use of reserved books.

(13)	A bookstore that is more than a purveyor of primers and
theme paper; a bookstore that will arouse interest in books.

Many of these improvements would require more money than
the University has to spend. We recommend them anyhow, since
we are asked to criticize. Some day the University will have the
money.

Others would require a detailed study, the work of several
years. We recommend them also. We are asked to criticize.

Dramatists and actors trudge along
every afternoon to Playfest rehearsals,
working for their play on Feb. 5 and
6.

Mirror Problem

Mirror staff labors with the newest
problems of production and they hope
for play too on March 5 and 6.

The Senior class, however, is reliev-
ing a little of the present severity in
the social program by giving a mixer
on Friday afternoon at 4:30 in the
Reynold’s club. Mrs. Merrill is to be
hostess.

The Sophomore class is also seeking
a little more pleasure by giving a
luncheon at noon on this same Friday
at Ida Noyes hall.

Acacia objecting to this unequal dis-
tribution of work and play is defying
the present conventions by dining and
dancing at the Southmoor Hotel on
Saturday evening.

Psychology Dance

Even the Psychology department
fears the dullness of the atmosphere
and enters a dinner dance for Satur-
day evening at Ida Noyes hall.

In the rush of solving problems
news of Playfest comes to break work
and offers a few plays to keep us from
the consequences of “making Jack ?
dull boy.”

PATRONIZE THE DAILY MAROON ADVERTISERS

vox pop ;

To the Editor,

The Daily Maroon,
University of Chicago,
Chicago, Illinois.

Dear Sir:

When, in the course of college events
a woman takes a few majors of physical
education, it doesn't hurt her at all.
When she intentionally forgets to go to
her classes in "graded" five times in one
quarter she “flunks” and fairly enough.

And when some industrious senior
writes, "Reorganize the women’s phy-
sical education department so that it will
be efficient,” righteous indignation burns
within my otherwise peaceful heart and
I must to the defense.

The women’s physical education de-
partment has its faults, as do all depart-
ments and individuals. Not the least of
these faults Is lack of enough instruc-
tors to handle the howling mob. But
nothing could be more basely unjust than

the charge of inefficiency. The iiMivid-
ual members are exceptionally efficient ;
and the department as a whole is run
on a most effective program.

I distinctly remember Miss Dudley’s
invitation to incoming freshmen and
upperclassmen, in autumn, to drop their
complaints and suggestions in a box pro-
vided for the purpose. I don’t know
how many suggestions the department
received, but that, methinks, Was the
time for our senior’s complaint. Of
course, some persons are always a little
liehind the times. But, Senior, if you
had nothing to tell Miss Dudley, why
tell the world?

Yours for justice,

Another Senior.

WITH CHEERING

Evening Moat Successful of
Intra-Mural Cage
Season

In an evening featured by fast games
and a large crowd of watchers, the
intermural department ran off two
class A and six class B tilts.

The winners in the “A” games were
Phi Gamma Delta and Kappa Sigma,
the former rather a runaway and the
latter a close fight. For the most part,
the “B" games were clean cut, fast
tilts. A story of each contest fol-
lows:

Phi Gam Wins Again

Flashing one of the most powerful
offenses exhibited thus far in the big
intramural tourney the Phi Gams last
night continued their winning streak
by downing the Kappa Nus by a score
of 40 to 8. Ralston was the big scorer
for the winners, caging 6 field goals
while Grant, sensational center, con-
tinued his scoring orgy by sinking four
markers from the floor. The guarding
of McCarthy was also a feature of the
game and in addition he got three bas-
kets.

Phi Betas Lose

In the closest game of the evening
Kappa Sigma defeated Phi Beta Delta
14 to 13. The encounter was full of
the thrills and the result was in doubt
until the final whistle was blown.
Johnson and Krogh were the outstand-
ing men for the victors but the work,
especially the defensive play, of the
whole team stood out. Pearlstein
played a good game for the losers.

In class B Delta Tau Delta scored
a victory over Psi Upsgilon by a close
score of 9 to 7. It was an exceedingly
roughly played game and the tight
guarding of both aggregations out-
stood.

Tou Sigs Comeback

The Tau Sigs, springing a last half
comeback beat the Alpha Sigs 18 to 4.
At the first part of the game the Alpha
Sigs had the upper hand but due to
some nice pass work under the bas-
ket the Tau Sigs came out on top.

Due to the good work of Therwin,
who caged six ringers, the Sigma Nus
were able to beat Phi Beta Delta 20
to 6. Shamberg scored all the points
for the losers by contributing three
field goal*.

Close Game

Zeta Beta Tau and Delta Chi played
a d^se game but by virtue of Kirel-
heimer’s 3 baskets the Zeta Betes won.
The pass work of both teams was off
form

Phi Sigma Delta steamrolled over
the Tau Delts by a score of 30 to 1,
allowing no field goals. Tengold was
big point man with 11 baskets.

Bowlers May Start

Games Earlier Now

According to Carl Erickson, Intra-
mural manager for bowling, plans have
been made with the Reynolds club man-
agement to allow intramural matches to
berin at 3 *30 instead of 4 o’clock. Many
teams have complained that their
matches ran over into the dinner hour
and caused much unnecessary trouble,
as well as cold meals.

From now on teams may start their
contests earlier if they so desire, but
should make arrangements with their
opponents as to the exact time. Other-
wise the match will be called at 4 o’clock,
as originally scheduled.

With some of the teams boasting
unusual offensive strength and others
counteracting this with equally rare
defensive power it seems as if the Big
Ten basketball season is going to con-
tinue to be a hectic succession of ups
and downs.

No Change This Week

The end of the week will see hard-
ly any change in the present muddled

with Minnesota tonight and Ohio

TRACKMEN-MEET

HOOSIERS FRIDAY

On the evening of the day after to-
morrow Chicago’s track team will in-
dulge in its first Big Ten meet of the
year. Indiana is coming to Bartlett
gym to meet a team which they know
little about and which knows little about
them. In fact, no one knows just how
strong either team will be in relation
to the other one. Around here the Ma-
roons are the favorites. Down at Bloom-
ington it is the other way around.

One thing is sure, though, as sure as
anything is in athletics. This is that it
will be a close and exciting duel. It, is
rumored that the Hoosiers are strong
in two events—the quarter mile and the
high jump. The strength of the Ma-
roons in the half mile and mile, thanks
to the speed of Capt. Cusack, is ex-
pected to win those events. How the
other events will be distributed will de-
termine the winner, and make the meet
very hotly contested.

The Maroon entries include: Weddell,
L. Smith, Red Smith, in the 50-yard
dash; Weddell, Smith, Metzenberg, in
the low hurdles; Morrison. Metzenberg,
in the high hurdles; Beals, Armstrong,
Landworth, Spence, in the quarter mile;
Jim Cusack, Jack Cusack, Rcvenscroft,
in the half mile; Jim Cusack in the mile;
Hegovick, Steen, in the two mile; Burg,
Cody, in the high jump; Burg, in the
pole vault; and Hobscheid, Duval, in
the shot put.

ISSUE I-M BOOKLET

A calendar of intramural sport events
and lists of the winners of intramural
athletics of the past quarter are in-
cluded in a booklet of general informa-
tion for the winter quarter, ssued by
the department of intramuiai athletics.
The participation point standing of the

men wouldn't injure their future pres-
tige greatly while it would have them
resting on the Staters after the stand-
ings column was compiled.

Just now Ohio State and Wisconsin
are enjoying the pleasant sensations
which come to those who lead, but if
the season keeps running true to form
the pair in a few week will feel the
pangs of those who trail. Purdue via
Spradling gifted-the Staters with their
reverse, while our own Maroons ran
up to Madison to show Doc Mean-
well’s team and the mid-west at lafjjc
that a fair game of basketball is also
played around the Midway.

Wolverines Have Played Ten Games

Michigan has done little participat-
ing in the nice little schedule they
cooked up for the Big Ten teams at
the coaches meeting last winter, but
humble Illinois gave them something
to think over, in their idle moments
already. Probably some member of
this team will volunteer to aid B. Mo-
lenda in scoring the baskets. In the
three games played so far by the Ann
Arborites the former fullback has made
as many points as Friedman made
yards on the gridiron last year.

Among the also rans Iowa has been
slipping badly and continued to slide
when Northwestern jumped on them
Tor the first conference victory the
Wildcats have scratched up this year.

W. A. A. PLANS DAY
OF SPORT AT PALOS
PARK THIS SATURDAY

W. A. A. will hold an all-day outing
in the form of a picnic Saturday at Palos
Park. All members of the organization
who wish to go will meet in the foyer
of Ida Noyes hall at 8 and will go out
in cars belonging to the following wo-
men: Alice Wiles, Florence Herzman,
Helen Biamskas, and Katherine Homan.
It is planned to return to the city about
3:30 or 4.

Everyone who intends to go has been
requested to sign up in the foyer of Ida
Noyes hall before Friday noon. Hannah
Johnson, who is in charge of luncheon
arrangements, has asked each woman to
bring her own individual lunch. Pan-
sliding, tobogganing, and skating will be
followed by a sing around a huge fire,
according to Eleanor Fish, president of
W. A. A. The women also intend to
look over the park for a location for
the lodge which they formerly intended
to build at the Dunes.

Picks Lineup For

Hawthorne Contest

Grach Vorhees has his men all picked
for the gala mat meet with the Haw-
thorns Athletic club tonight. Laverdi
and Shear are billed to appear for the
117 pounders, Steinfield and Chapinsky
for the 127, and Capt. Graham and
Landa for the 137. Davis and Kurtzin

WHAT o/IT?

fgQI^e MOtyjENSTEty

To such of the Conference teams who
are so unfortunate as to be on the In-
diana basketball schedule this winter, I
bring sad tidings. The Hoosiers, it is a
sufficiently well known and obvious fact,
are mean enough (on the basketball
floor) under any conditions, and now
additional circumstances have arisen
which make them even more ominous
than ever. These circumstances are one
Slim Hodges, a sophomore at rustic
Bloomington. I say “circumstances” be-
cause Mr. Hodges—if there ever was
one—is a triple threat basketball player;
he shoots, and he shoots, and he shoots.
I suspect that the townspeople of
Bloomington, waking suddenly in the
still stretches of the night, can still hear
the echoes of the baskets Mr. Hodges
popped that afternoon coming up in-
cessantly from Indiana gymnasium. Mr.
Hodges is THAT kind of a guy.

BOTH CONTESTANTS HAVE STRONG

DEFENSES BUT ARE WEAK POINT

GAINERS; DOPE FAVORS MAROONS

Minnesotans Hope to Send Norgrenites Home Defeated;
Have Not Won a Single Game and Look
To This as the First Victory

He came to Bloomington from
Shelbyville High School; Shelbyville,
as you may perhaps have heard on some
obscure occasion, is in Indiana, and In-
diana is where young, old, middle-aged
and babies-in-arms play the noble game
of basketball as it is played in no other
state anywhere. So it is of more than
passing import’ that a whisper has run
around the battlements to the effect that
Mr. Hodges is’ the greatest basketball
player ever produced in Indiana.

TAU DELT BOWLERS
WIN; DELTA SIG TIES

------

Four teams battled yesterday after-
noon in tffe' Reynolds club for intra-
mural bowling honors. The first match
went into a tie at one game apiece; the
second was.won in two games by Tau
Delta Phi^A

Play was .JHlfih improved over the
previous days of the present tourney,
the scor^'^iij? on the average much
higher and the play going much faster.
There were several high scores pulled
off during both matches.

Delta Sigma Phi lost the first game
of their contest by the score of 470 to
405 to Z. B. T., the poorest game of the
afternoon’s play, In the second game
they came back strong and took it by
the long score of 548 to 462. The knot
will be played off tomorrow afternoon
in the Reynolds <3ub alleys.

The last mat®# of the day was the
best. Tau Delta Phi defeated Acacia
two games straight by the scores of 621

By Irving Goodman

Boasting the sturdiest defense of

any Big Ten team, the Maroons will

give their system a trial against an-
other team of guarding specialists
when they clash with the oft beaten

Gophers tonight in the Minneapolis
zero weather. On paper the Maroons
appear about fourteen points stronger
than the Northerners. Illinois defeat-

ed the Maroon and Gold 17 to 8 and

Chicago just got through walloping
Coach Ruby’s quintet. But since com-
parative scores mean less than nothing
Coach Norgren is taking no chances.

Gophers Present Strong Outfit

Coach Taylor’s outfit will present
their full strength for the first time
this season. Capt. “Black” Rasey, as
slick and as deadly a forward as ever
wore a Viking jersey, will lead the
Minnesota offense. Nydahl, the sopho-
more football star, will play opposite
him. Wolden, who has been ill for
some time, will jump center and Ma-
son and Wheeler, two veterans, will
strut their stuff at guard.

If the impregnable Midway defense
can stop Racey, the locals should win
handily. Despite the Gopher defense
the Maroons should eke out about
twenty points which should be ample
to keep the Minnesota win column un-

marred. In four games Chicago has
held its opponents to a total of 7’
points which is the best record of any
time in the Big Ten.

Locals Play Four Games

If the Maroons can weather the
gruel of four games in eleven days
there is strong reason to believe that
they will land high in the Conference
race, for a win in early season looks
just as big in the standings column as
a late season victory.

In accordance with the Daily Ma-
roon policy to predict basketball re-
sults here is humbly presented the
forecast for tonight’s game:

Chicago, 20—Minnesota, 13

GYMNASTS GIVE

DEMONSTRATION

The members of the board of South
Park commissioners have tendered an
official invitation to University students
to attend a demonstration which the
gymnastic team is giving at Hamilton—-
Park on Friday night of this week. The
commissioners are sponsoring the event
to show the public what a wide field is
open to the sportsman.

The work of the gymnasts is gener-
ally conceded to be nothing short of re-
markable, for the feats which they per-
form rival those performed by profes-
sionals in both skill and daring. Thus
their meets with other institutions af-
ford interest not only to the partisans
of the competing teams but to other
spectators as well.

Men are what women marry. Gen-

That universities have to be (and

That the trustees of a university

strenuous exertions are being made
through the proper channels in an effort
to get him eligible. But the folks down
at Bloomington feel that the situation
would not be considered so grave if the
real truth about Mr. Hodges ever came
to be known. For, it seems, the prob-

extremely lean. “It is too

That the present alumnus has great-

One may doubt whether a board ex-

However, such bits of knowledge, and
a few others which might be added,
are considered by the alumnus to be
of great profit to himself. And they
make him feel that since coming to
the university he has “got a more out
of it than he put in.”

■women.

5.	Acting on a suggestion by one
of its members, the entire counci’

6.	Five students were selected to
compose the new Executive council
of the “All For Chicago” campaign.

Three men and two women were

Trebow and Allen Heald are the men.

The new committee will look over
and sort the suggestions and criti-
cisms handed in by the members of
the graduating class in the chapel
poll and will decide what steps are to
be taken. According to Charles An-
derson, president of the Undergrad-
uate council, they will begin work
immediately.

Student Suggest* Garage

New criticisms have come to the {
attention of the Editor of The Daily
Maroon since the excerpts were
printed last week. One student sug-
gests that the University might build
a large garage in which the students
might rent parking space, thus elim-
inating much of the congestion about
the quadrangles. The same writer
suggests that a department of music
would greatly enhance the campus, I

Suggestions such as the improving;
of the quality of the beans in the;
commons, reducing the charges in-
curred by the buildings and grounds I
were among those submitted. One
student suggested in strenuous tones
that final exams be supplanted by
term papers and short periodical
tests.

OBJECT OF DRIVE

“A foundation of European peace
is being laid through the medium of
the Student Friendship association,”
s» 1 Jeanette Hayward, co-chairman
of the Student Friendship drive of
Y. W. C. A., “when it helps students
of all the countries to meet together
in school life, as the reconstruction
of the European educat’onal system
is permitting them to do.”

The students in foreign countries
are associating without reservation
and without national prejudice on a
give-and-take basis with an open-
mindedness ready to see both sides
of every question. “The students of
America may feel proud when they
realize that this reconstruction of
Europe’s younger generation is being
effected in part by an American or-
ganization, though they are helping
to bring about one of the greatest
world changes ever made,” Miss Hay-
ward continued.

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, THURSDAY? JANUARY 28, 1926

Doc Bratfish Says

He’s Been Cheated

“Doc” Bratfish, the man who
is responsible for many self-con-
scious looks and cold necks around
campus, is thoroughly disgusted
with the hunt for the campus
Apollo, he asserts. The main
reason for this is that, although
at the beginning of the hunt every-
one on campus was declared elig-
ible, someone has been holding opt
on him and keeping back his votes.

When questioned “Doc” very re-
luctantly gave a description of the
person whom he considers the
second best looking man on cam-
pus. “This person very closely
resembles me,” he began modestly,
“he is very tall, has beautiful red
hair, slanting green eyes, wears
huge balloon pants, and a class
toque. Perhaps he is more of a
Scandinavian than a Greek type.
In sports his ability is really sec-
ond only to my own.”

MIRROR PLANS
SECOND TRYOUT

Give Further Opportunity to
Women Seeking Parts

, Additional tryouts for the First
I Annual Mirror will be held tomorrow

at 3:30 in the theatre of Ida Noyes
hall. All those women who were un-
able to go through the second trial,
and those who were not able to ap-
pear at all. have been requested to
appear for this try-out, which will be
' for both cast and chorus. Miss Mari-
anne Durbrow, who will coach the
I choruses, will be in charge of the try-
outs.

Alta Cundy, general manager of
Mirror, wishes to remind all tljose
women who can play the banjo,
ukelele, saxaphone or any other in-
strument to meet with her Tuesday
from 12 to 12:30 in Cobb 110. Those
interested in singing have been asked
to meet with her in the theatre of Ida
Noyes hall Monday at 3:30 to try
out for vocal parts.

“The response of the women at our
first tryout was extremely encourag-
ing,” said Miss Cundy. “However,
we know that there is a great deal of
hidden talent yet to be revealed, and
i we want everybody who is interested
j to come to the tryout tomorrow. Miss
Durbrow will tell you how good you
: are.”

Miss Cundy wishes to emphasize
the fact that both of these meetings
; are extremely important, and at-
; tendance at them may influence the
[ final choices.

EXAMINER’S OFFICE
MAKES PLANS FOR

CHANGE IN SYSTEM

Quicker and more efficient service
for students and all co-operating de-
partments is the promise of the Ex-
aminer’s office. A new filing system
is being installed which will consoli-
date the several old files into one
complete index of all current cases.
“Charge-out” cards will be inserted
whenever a case is removed from the
files so that the location of a stu-
dent’s credentials will no longer be
a matter of question.

“The Window,” 'heretofore synon-
omous with long waiting, will again
be under the complete charge of one
assistant. It is hoped that this will
do away with the series of long ex-
planations necessary b^ore the stu-
dent has been able to find the person
familiar with his case.

A minimum of explanation, a min-
imum of the more or less expected
“ red tape,” a minimum of time 9p&t
by both the student and the harlsi^
clerks in the office is the goal of t^e
office which decides the fate of Ml
entering students. ‘The Powers tl|at
be” expect the new system to J»
working smoothly by the end oJ.jpIs
quarter.

Historical facts showing Pontius
Pilate, the Roman procurator who
condemned Jesus, to have been an
arch-villain throughout his political
career, have been uncovered in a
study prepared at the University by
Miss Dorothea M. Harjes. The dis-
closure is made in an introductory
statement to a thesis on “Pontius
Pilate in Germanic Folklore” tracing
the various German legends referring
to Pilate from the second to the sev-
enteenth centuries.

These legends,' Miss Harjes says,
develop the notion of a fitting death
for a man who, in general Christian
thought, is regarded as a scoundrel.

Antagonized Jew*

An “inflexible, merciless and ob-
stinate” official, Pilate antagonized
the Jews at every turn and caused to
be murdered several bands of inno-
cent Christians, Miss Harjes goes on
to show. She continues, “He regu-
larly flaunted the eagles of the Ro-
man Legions and the standards of
Tiberius, (both to be worshipped as
dieties by Roman law) before a peo-
ple who believed it sinful to worship
any but their one God.

“He tried to enforce their obedience
to this Roman mandate.

Lured Samaritans

“It has been stated that the Samar-
itans whom he destroyed on Mt.
Garizim were lured there by a spy
in Pilate’s employ who promised them
the discovery of certain holy vessels
buried there by Moses on the moun-
tain side.	*

“Eusebius tells with a fair degree
of historical accuracy of the events
of Pilate’s procuratorship but adds
(upon what authority we do not
know) that he was banished to Vi-
enne in Gaul and there committed
suicide.”

“Spiced Wine” Is
Latest Play In

Paris Stagedom

“The Latest Thing from Chicago.”
In Paris! That’s the way French
theatres may soon be advertising
their plays; as a result of the influ-
ence of the University Dramatic asso-
ciation. according to Americans in the
French capital who predict an in-
creasing popularity for American i
plays.

For “Spiced Wine,” Willis K. Jones’1
new play, which is to be produced for
the first time in the Dramatic asso-
ciation Playfest, Feb. 5 and 6, is to be
produced in Paris next summer.

The Strolling Players, an American
dramatic organization now playing in
Paris has erquested permission to in-
troduce Mr. Jones’ play to the French;
stage. And arrangements have just,
been completed for the production

PLAN INSURANCE
ENDOWMENT AS
SENIOR PRESENT

Discuss Purchase of $250
Insurance Policies in

Chapel Today

Shall the class of ’26 break tradi-
tion by presenting the University
with a gift that will in a score of
years amount to $300,000?

Members of the senior ciass will
discuss this question today when they
consider an insurance endowment
plan suggested to the class gift com-
mittee by Charles F. Axelson, ’07,
of the board of trustees:

The plan involves the purchase of
a $250 insurance endowment policy
by each of the seniors. Twelve dol-
lars a year is paid on the policy for
20 years, at the end of which time
the full amount of the endowment is
turned over to the University.

Committee Favor* Plan

“The Senior class gift committee
is strongly in favor of the project,”
declared Seward Covert, chairman of
the group. “If four or five hundred
seniors purchase the policy, we can
donate a gift of greater quantity and
more useful quality than any other
class has given.

“The policy itself is not large, and
the yearly payment is so small that
it is of scarcely any appreciable im-
portance. But after twenty years we
shall have given to the University a
gift not only of which we may be
proud, but one that will set an ex-
ample for the classes that are to
come.”

Anderson Approve*

Charles Anderson, president of the
Undergraduate council, expressed
himself in favor of the plan. “It’s a
noble project, even if it is a little ex-
pensive. I think it’s worth while if
it succeeds in doing nothing more than
setting a shining example to future
classes.”

Although no vote has yet been
taken on the subject, the class seems
generally divided on the matter. No
better suggestion has yet been pre-
sented, according to Covert, and this
suggestion, besides having the sup-
port of alumni, is practically ideal.

Miller Give* Opinion

“All the buildings have, I believe,
been supplied with clocks and statu-
ary,” said Allan Miller, president of
the class. “The endowment plan is
worth considering for its singularity
at least.”

Discussion is expected to occupy
most of today’s chapel session, so that
the vote will not be taken until next
Thursday’s meeting. “Every senior
is expected to vote on the plan,” con-
cluded Covert, “and the gift commit-
tee urges the class to adopt it.”

MRS. ALTROCCHI TO

THE DAILY MAROON, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 1926

MAROON CONTEST COMPLEX

THE entry in the Beauty Contest
SQUIRMED in his seat.

THE quiz was tough

AND eligibility is important.

HE turned and peeked

JUST a trifle.

“HEY,” cried the prof,

“DON’T you know that

YOU can’t get by on your
LOOKS!?”

THE authorities over at the Rey-
nolds club, we are told, are developing
of late a noble interest in the protec-
tion xif the collegiate morality. Copies
of the American .Mercury are edited,
and recently a bad, bad article by
that horrid Dr. Fishbein was com-
pletely cut out. Further, goes the re
port, all liquor advertisements in the
London News are censored with black
crayon. This, we believe, is real spirit.
It should be carried even further.
Why, the other day, exposed where
anyone could see it, we saw an entire
article printed in bold letters. It is
nothing, these days, to see magazines
brazenly placed on the tables without
even so much as a cover!

A Handsome Idea!

I am entirely in favour of this Ma-
roon Man Hunt. In fact, if I might
suggest, it would be entirely justifi-
able if we who have been omitted from
the notoriety’ should band together in
a similar Man Hunt idea—to hunt the
fathead who started the darn thing!

THESE ARE MEN

(With Proper Acknowledgments to
Misogynist and R. H. L.)

Men are what women marry. Gen-
erally speaking, they may be divided
into classes of Husbands and Bache-
lors. A Bachelor is a mass of obstin-
acy upholstered with conceit and sus-
picion. Husbands differ as prizes, sur-
prises, and consolation awards.

Making a man into a husband is one
of the highest forms of feminine art.
It requires science, flattery, hope, and
charity—particularly charity!

If you flatter a man it makes him
unbearable; if not, you become un-
bearable. If you permit him to make
love to you he gets tired of you in the
end, and if you don’t he gets tired of
you in the beginning.

If you wear red shoes, a gay hat,
and sport a boyish bob he refuses to
seen in public with you—if you don’t,
then when you are out he spends all
the evening staring at a girl with red
shoes, a gay hat, and a boyish bob.

If you suggest going home after the
theatre he thinks you’re a dead one
and if you hint at the Inn he drops
you from the list as a pirate.

If you’re silly he longs for a bright
mate; if you act intelligent he longs
for a playmate.

If you are popular with others he’s
jealous, and if you aren’t . . well, no-
body wants a wall flower.

amination must resort to vagueness
as to what he has learned. Here are a

1 few things, more generalities:

That the prospectives in many
branches of knowledge are millions of
years and billions of miles longer than
he—the alumnus—supposed.

That, as a result, scientific workers
live and think in such tremendous
terms that they are the best of phil-1
osophers, the most reassuring of com-
panions, and the most genuine of dem-
ocrats.

That scientific workers and teachers
areabout as unselfish as human be-
ings can be expected to be, and as
little mercenary as is possible in an
era when bills are payable monthly.

That these same people work hard
—a good deal harder than the students.

That the soul of a university is the
composite soul of all these unselfish,
self-denying and hard-working mem-
bers of it; including those thousands
of students who really do work hard.

Calls Universities Supermen

That universities have to be (and
the best of them are) intellectual and
administrative supermen.

That the trustees of a university
are a group who. as it has been ex-
pressed, “give unsparingly in service.”

That, in a university like this, one
may say what he thinks and do as he
pleases; just so long as he conforms
to standards of ordinary decency, sin-
cerity and common sense.

That an institution in which such a
spirit has been built up is, at the same
time, a mighty business enterprise, the
direction of which calls for a wisdom
and courage greater than is needed
to run a gas company.

That a university should not make
a profit, but neither can it be permitted
to perish from poverty.

That, therefore, its ideals of work
and service must somehow “be got
across” to people who are well able
to keep its treasury full.

Finds Difficult Problem

That the foregoing process of en-
lightenment is an extremely difficub
problem.

That the present alumnus has great-
ly enjoyed working at this problem,
and hopes that, one way or another,
he can still be of assistance in solving
it.

One may doubt whether a board ex-
amining the present alumnus for an
advanced degree would award him any-
thing because of the above discoveries.
However, such bits of knowledge, and
a few others which might be added,
are considered by the alumnus to be
of great profit to himself. And they
make him feel that since coming to
the university he has “got a more out
of it than he put in."

Mr Gurny thinks that the fratern-

their average is seriously affected.

lete read like the well known page from ■
“True Confessions” and, what is more,
they bear out the startling claims made
on behalf of his prowess as a basket
popper. In his last six games in high
school, for instance, Mr. Hodges is
reputed to have averaged no less than
ten buckets a game. Sounds like a high
run in balk-line billiards or something.
It’s true, just the same. Hodges, so
report has it, is built something on the
order of “Slum” Gullion, the Purdue
center of a couple of years back. He is,
however, much more of a shot—oh,
much more! He slops them in from
anywhere, and it seems that he doesn't
know when to stop.

All this has occasioned grave concern
among those teams which are scheduled
to meet Indiana next semester, for al-
though Mr. Hodges is scholastically in-
eligible at the present writing, very
strenuous exertions are being made
through the proper channels in an effort
to get him eligible. But the folks down
at Bloomington feel that the situation
would not be considered so grave if the
real truth about Mr. Hodges ever came
to be known. For, it seems, the prob-
ability of his ever becoming eligible is
extremely lean. “It is too bad,” say
the folks at Bloomingtoq. “that the
greatest basketball player that ever
came to the Big Ten should also happen
to be the dumbest guy that ever came to
the Big Ten.” Truly a sad tale, mates.
