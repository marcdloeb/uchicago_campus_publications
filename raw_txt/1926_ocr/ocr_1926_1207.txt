CIRCUS NETS KIDDIES $1,000

This column is going to be some-
thing in the way of a book re n • v.
\, t a book review, but, as I any,
something in the way of one. It may
surprise some of my readers to find
me writing things like this I threat-
en Vet, 1 think, it’s a logical enough
thing for me, as for anyone who has
ever been given entire freedom in
filling a certain space in a newspa-
per. to drift off now and then into
the field of literary discussion. And
why not? Even my brother, in his
day a Sports Editor on the Maroon,
used to write review of books. True,
he used to review rather heavy tomes
turned out by the University of Chi-
cago press with the purpose of cul-
ture written all over them—I think
one of his reviews was on the Polish
Peasant in Europe and America, by
Thomas and Znarniecki. It grieves
me to think, even while I sun lest in
admiration for a man who could do
things like that, that my brother was
that kind of (al guy. For my re-
viewing goes no farther, for the time
at least, than to concern itself with
Mr. Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun
Also Rises, a rather light affair, com-
pared to the Polish Peasant, turned
out recently by Scribners.

I have. I must tell you before get-
ting down to the serious business
ahead, got myself engaged with re-
viewing and The Sun Also Ifises be-
cause of two separate and distinct
reasons. Firstly (as I used to say in
the high school debating club), I hap-
pened to go into the Book Store the
other day with Colonel Milt Kreines,
in quest of a thing called Illini Verse,
that, from from what I had seen of
it, seemed to hold out promise. The
Book Store, however, did not have
that particular book, but the man-
agement obligingly, as always, gave
me Mr. Hemingway’s book to read
instead, with the promise that it was
worth bothering with. That was the*
first reason for my reviewing. The
other is even more immediate. Oak
Park, my home town, as the hoys
say, has always been a peculiar phen-
omenom to me. “The Church Vil-
lage,” “The Largest Village in the
World,” “Mecca of the Women’s
Clubs”—these are some of the titles
it glories in. “Oak Leaves,” the town ।
weekly, is the voice of the village,
everybody subscribes to it, athough
it never has anything in it. Possibly
the people subscribe because the
magazine is so typical of the town.
Anyway that’s how things are in Oak ।
Park. Now I had heard Mr. Heming-
way was from my own village. True,
he lived in Paris, but once he was of
Oak Park. And he was said to write
-even write well. This was remark-
able .... it was astounding. I must
investigate the rumor 1 had said.
And here was the chance.

*	♦	♦	*

Well, Oak Park is, after all, not in
vain. Mr. Hemingway can write...
"ell. He is, possibly, the first Ameri-
pan who ever lived who has written
a book about life in Paris, and has
lived there to know what he was writ-
ing about. Certainly, at least, the
first Oak Parker who has done it. He
writes simply, casually, just as you
and I might tell something, after
starting out with a. . .“Say, a funny
thing happened to me yesterday,”
and then going on, without flourish,
to tell what it was. Three-quarters
'• the book is dialogue.. .and good
dialogue, almost brilliant in spots.
1 he rest is simply, short declarative
sentences. And the book, in its 250
Pages, gets on... as its drifting, Paris
(afe crowd does not. As modern nov-
’ds go, it’s good stuff, and you could
do a great deal worse than occupy
yourself with it, as I did, for an
evening. But, of course, for me
there was the question of whether
(,ak Park was to be vindicated or not
And, unfortunately, not everyone is
from Oak Park—although most are.

INDANCING CLASS

Give Physical Culture Credit
For Regular Practice
In Winter Quarter

Blackfriars’ annual production
promises to be almost professional in
its quality when it is presented next
spring. The former more or less hap-
hazard way of selecting the choruses
has been abandoned and in its place,
there is to be a class which will run
throughout the winter quarter and
which purposes to fit its members for
stage, chorus, and acrobatic dancing.

This dancing class which will give
full Physical Culture credit, is not
restricted alone to those men wish-
ing to continue work in Blackfriars.

Open To All

It is open to anyone whether he in-
tends to kvep on or not, and counts
the same as regular physical culture
credit in either case. The class will
meet from 1:35 to 2:05 four days
a week in Reynolds club theatre, and
if the idea which has never been
tried before at the University, is suc-
cessful, it will be held every winter
quarter from now on.

Joe Barron, who has starred in
previous Blackfriars’ productions

and
with

in Settlement Night
his dancing, will have

WOMEN OF FACULTY
DISCUSS CLUBHOUSE

AT LAST LUNCHEON

Possibilities of establishing a Fac-

the women of the faculty today at

of a series of luncheons which, ac-
cording ‘to a custom established last
year, have been held every two weeks.

Miss Ann Elizabeth Brewington,
head of the department of Secretar-
ial work and Miss Lydia J. Roberts,
instructor in the department of Home
Economics, have been in charge of
the series of luncheons for this quar-

last Sunday. When he did not return
by Tuesday evening his fraternity
brothers became anxious and called
up the home of Pete, Virginia Weiss,
’28—who stoutly denied any knowl-
edge of his whereabouts. The fact is
that they had eloped to Waukegan,
where they were married by Pastor
Howard E. Ganster of Christ Church,
Episcopalian. At the time of the

National Federation
Attempts to Solve
Enigmas of College

A solution of the problems con-
fronting the American college stu-
dent, including the fraternity, facul-
ty, student government and curri-
cula questions, was initiated at the
first meeting of the National Student
Federation, held Dec. 2, 3 and 4 at
the University of Michigan.

Gifford Hitz was the official repre-
sentative of the University of Chi-
cago, sent by the Undergraduate
council and Dean Boucher. He will
submit his report to the faculty on
Wednesday of this week.

Almost three hundred representa-
tives from more than two hundred
American and foreign universities
were addressed by world famous edu-
cators occasionally in the French and
German tongues. The Council will
eventually resolve itself into an in-
ternational organization.

In spite of the unprosperous finan-
cial conditions alleged to be existing
in the city of Chicago, Settlement
night brought forth as its quota of
the Drive approximately $1013, fall-
ing short of last year’s record by a
scant $100. From the attendance, it
was estimated that the average
amount spent per person was $1.50.

The following figures, prpceeds of
the individual projects, are unofficial
and approximate only gate receipts
$160, vodvil $216, dance floor $35,
booths $16, ticket girls $315, check-
rooms 40, program sales $30, pro-
i gram ads 108, box sales $135, flow-
| ers $23.

Chairmen Extend Thanks

The chairmen wish to express their
appreciation for the help and co-op-
eration given, by the ticket, program
and flower saleswomen, boothsales-
men and coat checkers.

Thanks are also extended to the
many friends of Settlement outside
the University, the box holders: Mes-
dames Coleman, Freund, Goodspeed,
Hall, Koessler, McLaughlin, Nitze,
Sherer, Swift, Wiles, Wilson and
Gorrel, and to the kind donors of
time and products: Mrs. W. A. Nitze,

Settlement Night came off at last
with much shouting and excitement.
The real circus atmosphere was all
there, except for one detail. There
were no animals to pervade the place
with a pungent reminder of the
stockyards. Not that this was a de-
fect—quite the contrary. But the
barkers calling their wares in your
ear, the milling crowd inevitably
pushing you in the direction you did
not want to go, the noise of a dance
orchestra above all the din, and the
big show inside, were there. And
these are the best part of any circus.
The crowd that turned out for it fell
in with the spirit of the affair and
shouted and pushed with gusto. Both
shows were very funny—in fact the
audience appreciated some of the
acts so much that they threw gifts
onto the stage in true college style.

The house dances kept many on
campus Friday night; the Deke
freshman party, the Chi Psi party
and the A. T. O. party were the
main attractions Saturday night
Paul Whiteman drew a larger crowd
from school than we had thought
possible. But he was worth every-
thing one had to pay. His orchestra
can never be equaled in spite of
those who say he is slipping.

The real social scoop of the week
has been stolen by the front page—
the marriage of Peter Pan and Atlas,
alias Virginia Weiss and William Sol-
enberger on last Tuesday, so all we
can do is offer them our heartiest
congratulations and best wishes.

charge of the class. Barron has
taught gymnastic classes in the West
parks for the last five years and, in
addition to this, has gone on the Or-
pheum Circuit with his own acts for
the past few summers, so he should
be adequately experienced to act in
this capacity.

While the class offers an excellent
opportunity for practical training, at
the same time satisfying the require-
ments for credit, it is invaluable to
those men intending to try out for
Blackfriars choruses, Most of the
special groups will come from this

SETTLEMENT NIGHT

SINCE figures don’t lie. Settlement night, known to days of yore
as one of the grandest official brawls around these parts, was a
moderate financial success. But since seeing is believing, it was a
distinct social failure. Not that everybody in the swim wasn’t there.
Not that, indeed, for all the committee heads were there, and all the
salesmen and saleswomen were there, and a few roundabouts with
nothing better to do were there. And that was all. The halls of
dear old Mandel were virtually empty.

In the first place the Settlement night committee undertook a
project which they were not able to, or did no bother o carry out.
The only evidences of a circus were the barkers in the booths, who
in their noble intentions made a continuous gust of raucous noises in
order to sell their none too delectable wares. The rest of the set-
ting was so badly done that it failed to produce any atmosphere at
all, much less that of a circus.

The music was eminently second or third rate. Almost every
act of the vaudeville deserved and won a shower of pennies. Grant-
ed that to round up twenty good bits of amateur talent is well nigh
impossible on this, our campus. Then why not reduce the number to
ten? Further divertisements were lacking in toto.

The spirit of Settlement night was not at any time vividly inflicted
on the consciousness of the campus. Few persons even thought to
attend.

Perhaps time will erase the memory of last Saturday night, aAd
perhaps the welkin of good fellowship will ring roundly once
again when the big time comes around next year.

A NOTE TO THE NEW STUDENT AUDITOR

THIRTY-TWO fraternity chapters at the University of Chicago
* operate chapter houses on the campus. Each of these houses
requires a certain amount of provisions weekly to run the table and
the house itself. At the present time each chapter does is own buy-
ing, and usually this function falls to the lot of a chapter member,
who may not have had any previous experience in buying.

The price advantage of buying in large -quantities is one of the
cardinal points in economics. If the weekly purchases of all the
chapter houses on the campus were compiled the result would pre-
sent an astonishing total, and the lower prices which could easily be
obtained if the buying were done through one agent would effect
tremendous savings to the fraternities.

Many plans for co-operative fraternity buying have been worked
out by private concerns, interested only in their private gain at the
expense of the fraternity men. These plans help not at all. How-
ever, the university could perform a great service for the frat-
ernities by working out a sensible system of buying, keeping in
mind the benefit to the fraternities, and not the possibilities of profit.
The expenses for the development of the plan could easily be paid
out of the savings to the groups. The university is depending more
and more on the fraternity groups to support the school’s campaigns
and uphold its policies and ideals. The men, in turn, have been
increasingly willing to actively carry out their share of these
obligations, and we believe that such a scheme of co-operative buy-
ing would be an excellent example of a large university’s practical
assistance to the fraternities.

LAMBERT SPEEDS UP
PURDUE CAGE DRILL

Lafayette, Ind., Dec. 7.—Presence of
five men from the football team has
served to pep up Purdue’s basketball
practice considerably, and Coach Ward
Lambert is now drilling his court
squad in hard scrimmages nightly in
preparation for the opening of the
season, with State Normal in Mem-
orial gymnasium here December 14.
The football performers who have re-
cently been added to the squad are
Wilcox, Wilson, Ramby, Speidel and
Eibel.

Lambert is directing all of his en-
ergies at the present time toward de-
veloping a center to succeed Cramer
and a forward to take the place of the
Great George Spradling, two of the
biggest stars lost by graduation last
year. Bob Wilson, who last year play-
ed at floor guard, has been shifted to
forward, but has worked only a little
because, of a football injury. Cummins,
a former Frankfort star, looks to be
about the best of the pivot candidates.

Wheeler, the diminutive forward who
came to the front at the close of last
season by his excellent basket shoot-
’ng, is showing improved form this
year, and has also taken on weight, a
fact which should help his general play
greatly. Purdues* Big Ten season will
open with Ohio State in the Memorial
gymnasium on January 8.

..Once more that first Pennsylvania
touchdown in the Chicago game bobs
up. The score, if you remember dis-
cussions of it. was made when a Penn
runner who tackled on, near or over
the goal line, depending upon how
accurately the eyes of the spectators
were watching the pJay. He fumbled,
and the ball rolled over the exten-
sion of the side line in the end zone.

Now Mr. Milton Ghee, who was one
of the four officials in that game
w-rites to the BIG TEN WEEKLY

Morrison, Strong, Duval,
Ault and Others
Lost To Team

The

hopes that were afloat

last

spring concerning a championship in-
door track team for 1927 received two
death blows recently in quick succes-
sion. The two sad occurrences were
caused by the issuance of the ineligi-
bility- and dropped-out-of-school lists.

This year’s football fatality list
shows a marked decrease trom the
1925 records according to the Colum-
bian Missourian, which adds that only
nine persons were killed as a result
of injuries sustained in the game as
compared to twenty-five last year.

As in the past years the players who
were killed were mainly members of
secondary school elevens- and of pro-
fessionaf teams.

Football is dangerous to life only
when players are not well coached and
conditioned was proved by the fact
that no fatalities occurred on the col-
lege elevens or the big private school

to say that the ball clearly was carried | Many of the most consistent of last

over the goal line and sends a photo-
graph which demonstrates that fact
beyond a doubt.

Had the ball been fumbled in the
field of play it could not have been a
touchdown, for the rule involving the
momentum of the ball would have
made it a touchback.

We hope that Mr. Ghee’s statement
will satiate any who may have thought
that Pennsylvani got a touchdown that
it didn't exactly deserve, or need, as

team won in the annual game

hockey
against
of 3 to

The Undergrads made all three of
their points during the first half, the
Alums coming back strong second half
to score two goals. Except for a short
time during the latter part of the game

year’s performers will be unavailable
for the team this year, because of those
two well known bugbears.

The pole vaulting section is hit the
hardest. McDonald and Strong, both
of whom were clearing the bar at over
eleven feet have definitely dropped out
of school. Strong is also a shot put-
ter of note. Vincent Libby and Chuck-
Duval, both boys who throw the
weights with the same ease that they
threw footballs are out of the running
with scholastic difficulties.

The runners are also weakened by.
the loss of men. Hathaway and Wil-
kins. both bears at the 440 are snowed
under piles of low grades and will not
be able to compete. Ault, who runs
a sweet half mile, and Morrison, one
of Chicago’s best bets in the hurdles
last year have also run afoul of scho-
lastic obstacles.

However, the team is definitely bet-
ter than last year’s outfit and they
should show well in the conference
meet.

the Honor team exhibited superiorly
over the Alums both offensively and
defensively.

The Alumni team lineup follows:
Alumni: L. W. Beringer; L. I. Novak;
C. F. Thompson: R. I. Lakin; R. W.
Brennhasser; L. H. Curtis; L. F. Gor-
gas; C. H. Ames; R F. Burke; R.

Is Try for Point Important? We ’ll

Say It Is—And So Will U. S. C.

The

By Bob Stern
very best of football circles

have been very' shaken to the very
core this year and all by a very small
thing—that extra point after touch-
down. The controversy over its im-
portance was raised to white heat as
the football season progressed and last
Saturday’s victory of Notre Dame over
Southern California by the rather close
score of 13 to 12 gave the climatic em-
phasis to the argument.

That same thing has happened twice
to U. S. C. One afternoon, earlier in
the season, ‘Pop’ Warner’s Stanford
team managed to beat U. S. C. out of
the Pacific Coast Championship by a
final score of 13 to 12. Stanford’s goal
kicker managed to boot one of his

tries over for the extra point. South-
ern California’s man missed both of
his chances.

Michigan went into a tie for the
conference championship on two one-

point victories. Ohio State
the loss at their hands once
Buckeyes won compensation
very next bame, when they

suffered
but the
in their
escaped

a tie game with Illinois by the single
point.

As Warren Brown says, the Pacific

Coast conference is
after a touchdown.
Conference has two
cause of the point

won by one point
and the western
title claimants be-
after touchdown.

And so it really seems that it’s a very
important part of the game, that try
for the point.

Phi Sigma Delta, by defeating the
Macs in a fast and furious semi-final
game of touchball yesterday afternoon
won the right to engage in the final
championship game of the University
with the Psi U’s, winners over the D.
U.’s last Friday afternoon. The Psi
U’s, who won the championship last
year, are all primed for a like feat this
afternoon when they' meet the Phi Sigs
at 3 o’clock in the big game of the
year.

Both Strong

Psi Upsilon has a formidable
in the Phi Sigma outfit if the
from yesterdays’ game proves

rival
dope
any-

thing. The game was featured by the
airtight defense and spectacular pass-
ing of the Phi Sig’s. They romped
over the Macs to the tune of 42 to
0. Seemingly- every player was a star
when it came to team play and they
exhibited a clock-like unison.

Priess Stars

Priess, however, of Phi Sigma Delta,
played an excellent running and pass-
ing game. This is one man the Psi
U’s will have to watch as statistics
from yesterday’s game show that he
was instrumental in making six out of
the eight touchdowns and through
passing, running and receiving made
a total of 264 yards. The Macs were
continually held and kept from mak-
ing downs and forced to punt. The Phi
Sig’s would then run the ball back
past midfield and gradually work it
over the line. The one time the Macs
had a chance of scoring their pass was

intercepted under the Phi Sig’s
and taken back thirty-five yards
out of danger.

PETER PAN AND ATLAS have
gone and done it! At last the Whis-
tle can throw out its chest and tell
the world about its success as a mat-
rimonial bureau. Last year Bill
wrote poetry about Chicago’s resemb-
lance to “a great big pancake” and
how he wanted to ‘‘drown it in sy-
rup.” Then he was introduced to
Pete this year. . .and his style chang-
ed. Immediately he composed some-
thing about petals on a daisy and
how she loved him and loved him not.
We suspected something all the time,
but holy Moses. . .they’ve gone and
done it!

Dear GeoG:

I was searching around yesterday

David H. Stevens, assistant to the
president, will reveal some new views
on Milton in his lecture entitled “Mil-

poetic endeavor.”
