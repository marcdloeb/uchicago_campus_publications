DENOMINATIONAL
CLUBS CONVENE
FRIDAYEVENING

Seek New Members In Open
Chib Campaign In

Meeting

As a part of the Open Club cam-
paign, and as a demonstration that the
clubs are interested in securing those
students that are now “club-less" for
members of the different groups, a
joint meeting of all the denominational
clubs and groups on campus has been
called for Friday evening, Feb. 19, at
7:30 in Ida Noyes theater. All stu-
dents having an interest in the social
activities of their own denominational
group arc invited.

The purpose of the meeting is to
bring together not only the members
of the different clubs, but also all
of the prospective members that are
expected to be attracted by the meet-
ing. The gathering is in line with
the recommendations of the recent
Student Conference at Evanston.

Name Groups

Clubs and groups participating in
the meeting will be as follows: the
Baptist club, the Congregational club,
the Disciples club, the Dunkers club,
St. Marks (Episcopal) society, the
Lutheran club, Methodist group, and
the Westminister (Presbyterian) club.
Prof. Moulton will be the principal
speaker on the program and will de-
liver an address on “Recent Explora-
tions in Time and Space.” Following
the program refreshments will be
served.

Prolong Campaign

This gathering is one Of the first
steps in the campaign that the
clubs connected with the University
have conducted during the past week.
Last week was named “Open Club
Week" and most of the clubs called
special meetings or added varied enter-
tainment to their regular meetings in
order to attract new members. As it
was felt that one week did not give
sufficient time for the various groups
to start an intensive rushing program,
the campaign has been prolonged.
During this week, the clubs will con-
tinue to seek new members from
amongst the University students who
are not affiliated.

At present there are nearly one hun-
dred clubs on campus with an average
membership of forty. Their activities
cover the entire range of interests in
which college students may conceiv-
ably participate. They range in mem-
bership from those of one department
to a membership of those of one race.

Students Risk
Injury to Save

Life of Child

Narrowly escaping serious injury in
a wrecked automobile, two university
students yesterday probably saved the
life of a little girl by quick headwork.

Arnold Johnson and Milton Hayes,
were driving east on 57th St., in
Johnson’s car, a Paige sedan, when
suddenly without warning the girl ran
out from behind a parked car at the
call of her mother who was waiting
in a car across the street. She sped
directly in the path of the sedan, which
was being driven by Johnson. John-
son, seeing only one course open,
swerved his car, which was travelling
at the rate of about twenty-five miles
an hour, and cut directly in front of
the girl, narrowly missing her with
his skidding back wheels, and striking
a lamp post directly in front of the
new chemistry laboratory. The car
then careened across the street on the
slippery pavement and struck the op-
posite curbing.

The car was badly damaged, but the
two occupants escaped with minor
scratches. The girl, suffering from
shock was taken at once to a nearby
hospital.

GEORGE WEIMER

LEAVES SCHOOL

Junior Leader Called Home
By Mother’s Illness

George C. Weimer, president of the
Junior class, business manager of
Blackfrairs. Winter Sports manager of
Intra-murals, member of Iron Mask
and Sigma Nu fraternity, was called
home Friday morning due to the sud-
den illness of his mother.

As yet no definite plans have been
made as to whom will supplant him
as head of the class of '27. When ask-
ed whether or not he would be back
Weimer said that he expected to take
his present courses by correspondence
and hoped, conditions permitting, to be
back for the spring quarter.

The Junior Class, now without its
leader, will continue to carry out any
activities that have been planned for
the quarter.

JAIL IS HELL YELL
PHI GAM FRESHMEN
PRIOR TO INITIATION

Five Phi Gam freshman spent
their last night of hell-week in a
cell. After satisfying the appetite
of the chapter with triple portions
of ice cream they sneaked out the
kitchen to an awaiting automobile.

After an evening of pleasure they
were taking the car to the garage
when they were stopped by a police-
man and accused of being automobile
robbers. Thier protests were futile.
The following evening the brothers
loaded with cigars and sweet words
effected their release. They agree
that there is a hell for freshmen.

ABNER H. BEREZNIAK
DIES AFTER ILLNESS

Abner H. Berezniak, prominent on
the campus for his work in the field
of social service and the Y. M. C. A.
died Sunday of ulcer of the stomach.
He was nearly twenty years of age.

Berezniak, who was forced to drop
some of his activities recently be-
cause of the death of his father, was
vice-president of the Phi Sigma Del-
ta fraternity. He was a day editor
of The Daily Maroon, an editor of
the “C” handbook, a charter member
of Kedu Remthet, and an assistant
field executive of the Boys Scouts of
America. The funeral will be held
tomorrow at 10 from the residence,
at 441 Roslyn Place.

DEAN WILKINS
MEETS DANTE

CLASS TODAY

Health Improving Slowly
Physicians Reports
Indicate

Dean E. H. Wilkins, who has re-
turned from the Presbyterian hospital,
where he has been confined for a
period of over five weeks, will meet
his Dante class today at his residence.
According to Mrs. Wilkins who was
called at her home yesterday, the Dean
will be confined to his home for a
little while longer and will continue to
hold his class there. His condition,
however, is improving slowly and he
expects to be out again soon.

May Resume Work

Mr. Wilkins was forced into the hos-
pital partly because of the burden of
work that was placed upon him at the
beginning of the winter quarter. His
doctors think, however, that he will
he able to resume part of his work in
the future. Mrs. Wilkins, in co-opera-
tion with the doctors in charge of the
case, is making every effort possible
to relieve Mr. Wilkins of all the strain
and worry that she can.

Dean Boucher Continues Work

Attending physicians declare that
for the rest of the quarter Mr. Wilkins
will not be able to assume his duties
as Dean. Dean Boucher, who has filled
Mr. Wilkins’ chair ever since he was
taken sick at the outset of the quarter,
will continue to do so until Mr. Wil-
kins’ condition warrants his return to
the tasks he left five weeks ago.

The fact that Dr. Wilkins is able
to resume the instruction of his class
in Dante points to a decided im-
provement on his condition. This
gives assurance that, although the
progress of his recovery is slow, still
it is consistent and will soon enable
him to enter upon whatever duties
he expects to take up.

Mrs. Goode to
Talk at Y. W.

Meeting Today

Gone is the day when women can
leave politics to the men. This state-1
ment will be substantiated in an ad-;
'dress by Mrs. Katherine H. Goode’
on “Women Should Mind Their Own ’
Business” at an open-house meeting
of the Citizenship Committee of Y.
W. C. A. today at 3:30 in the Y.
W. room of Ida Noyes hall.

Mrs. Goode, who is the wife of
Prof. J. Paul Goode of the Geog-1
raphy department of the University,
represented this district in the state
House of Representatives during the
recent session. While there, Mrs.
Goode made so enviable a record
that the Legislature Voters’ League
has given her the highest possible
rating as a legislator.

“Every woman who has any inten-
tion of voting intelligently in future
elections, will benefit herself greatly
by hearing from a woman as well
versed in politics as is Mrs. Goode.
All women interested have been in-
vited to attend this meeting,” said
Margaret Roberts, chairman of the
committee.

CANCEL STEPHEN’S

LECTURE ; POET ILL

Owing to the illness of James
Stephens, noted Irish poet, his lec-
ture scheduled for tonight has been
cancelled. Mr. Stephens was to make
his second campus appearance in
Mandel hall. Money for tickets will
be refunded at the University book-
store.

“Prom ” Number of Phoenix Makes
Debut Thursday; Material From
Circle Merger Enlarges Magazine

The Prom number of The Phoenix,
resplendent with variety in humor
and literariness, will make its ap-
pearance Thursday. This is the first
issue to appear since the merger of
the Circle with the humor magazine,
and, according to Fred Handschy,
editor of the newly combined publi-
cation, it contains the principal at-
tractions of both.

One of the stellar attractions of
the number is to be a highly amusing
picture of the undergraduates of the
“naughty nineties” contrasted with
the undergraduates of today, by
Prof. James Weber Linn. It will be
accompanied by an excellent cari-
cature of the author by Gonzales,
whose work was an outstanding fea-
ture of the Circle during the past
two years. The article itself will be
illustrated by Bill Cotant.

Howie Mayer, a former student at
the University who is now with the
Chicago Evening American, is doing
an article which he calls “The Notor-
ious Collegian.” It is a lightly sat-
irical expose of the daily newspapers
in feeding bum stuff about college
people to the public and the futil-
ity of trying to do anything about it.

Other first-class features of the
number will be “Extra-Curricular
Characters,” by Irma Selz, “A Minor
Explosion,” by Daniel Cotton Rich,
and “The Private Life of Juliet Cap-
ulet,” by Jo Waters.

The drawings will be done by Bill
Cotant, James Root, Victoria Smith,
Irma Selz, Raoney Bennett and
others.

TEACH NEW LOYALTY
SONG TO WOMEN AT
FEDERATION TONIGHT

Mrs. Charles Robbins, who has led
the singing at a number of W. A. A.
affairs, will lead the Federation sing
to be held tonight at 7 in the lounge
of Ida Noyes hall. Her daughter,
Helen, an alumna of the University,
will accompany her. Mrs. Robbins
instigated the song contest recently
held by W. A. A., members of which
will cooperate with Federation in
giving the sing.

Norman Reed’s new Chicago song,
which won the W. A. A. contest,
will be taught to University women
at this time. Members of W. A. A.
have been especially invited to at-
tend, according to Betty LeMay,
publicity manager of Federation.

PLACE NEW CHICAGO
PRIZE SONG ON SALE

AT BOOKSTORE TODAY

“Our Chicago” the prize winner of
the W. A. A. song contest has been
placed on sale at the University
bookstore today. Norman Reed, of
Blackfriars fame, is the author of
the prize song.

The loyalty song has been highly
recommended by both Mrs. Charles
Robbins and Mack Evans, organist
and choir master who were on the
committee in charge of the competi-
tion. Mack Evans, chairman of the
committee said, ‘ Our Chicago’ is a
very worthwhile song and is worthy
of taking its place among the other
University loyalty songs.” Mrs. Rob-
bins praised its qualities by saying,
“It is better than some of the songs
in the College song book, and cer-
tainly is worthy of a place in the col-
lection.”

Mr. Frederick H. Tracht, manager

of the University bookstore has an-
nounced that when he revises the
College song bock, he intends to
place “Our Chicago” among the oth-
er University loyalty songs. Copies
of the song will be sold for fifteen
cents.

ANN VAN NICE DRAWS
BEST MIRROR POSTER

Ann Van Nice, a student at the
University, has been announced as
the winner of the poster contest for
the first annual Mirror reflection
scheduled for March 5 and 6. Miss
Van Nice’s poster will be used in all
official advertisements of the play
and reproductions of it will be dis-
tributed about the University and
the downtown districts.

The competition was held under
the supervision of Victoria Smith,
chairman of the poster committee.
Prof. Walter Sargent, head of the
Art department, Miss Florence Wil-
liams, and Miss Laura Van Pepplen-
dam acted as judges. The winning
poster was chosen from the large
number submitted because of its ar-
tistic qualities, adaptability to ad-
vertising purposes and general at-
tractiveness, according to the judges.
All the other posters submitted will
be exhibited about the campus.

DEEMER LEE VICTIM

OF SCARLET FEVER

Deemer Lee, one of |the three
News Editors of The Daily Maroon,
came down yesterday with a case of
scarlet fever which may, according
to reports, keep him confined and
away from classes and news work
until about March 10.

Upon the first appearance of sym-
ptoms, he consulted a physician, who
advised his immediate removal to a

hospital. He was taken to the Du-
rand hospital at 637 S. Wood Street.

Besides his work on The Daily
Maroon, Lee is a member of the
Board of Student Publications, an
ex-editor of The Prom Maroon and
a member of Phi Delta Theta.

COUNCIL HUNTS
CONSTITUTION;

PUBLIC WAITS

Need Document to Prove
Legality of Excluding

Representatives

By H. Van Buren

Attempts to determine the legality
of the action of the Undergraduate
council in barring the public from
its meetings, were halted abruptly
yesterday by the discovery that the
constitution of the body was not to
be located.

Prominent faculty members and
authorities on parliamentary law re-
fused to express any opinions on the
question of the right of the council
to exclude its constituents, until the
constitution had been located to
show where the powers of the body
are derived.

Dean James Parker Hall, head of
the law schools, declared that he
was hardly in a position to pass upon
the legality of the council action un-
til he had seen the official statement
of the powers of the organization;
Whereupon a search was made for
the constitution of the body.

The office of the recorder, store-
house of official papers connected
with official University bodies, was
visited, but a memorandum in the
files disclosed that their copy had
been out since the middle of the
summer. Frank O’Hara, director of
student activities, had no trace of
the missing document, but affirmed
that the office of the dean would be
most likely place to locate it. Miss
Gordon, secretary to Dean E. H.
Wilkins, declared that the document,
she thought, had been lost since last
summer and was unable to say
whether it had since been found or
not.

Miss Gordon declared that a de-
termined search would be instituted
and the missing constitution would
be located within the next few days.

The question of admitting not
only reporters but any member of
the undergraduate student body to
meetings of its council has now been
definitely brought before the atten-
tion of advisory groups. Decision of
the matter rests with the constitu-
tion. The finding of this document
will settle the question, provided that
it contains a clause definitely desig-
nating the meetings to be either
secret or open.

THEOLOGIANS WILL
CONFER ON CHURCH
COOPERATION HERE

The Chicago Theological Seminary
and the Divinity School will be joint
hosts at an Inter-Seminary Confer-
ence Feb. 25 at the University. The
general theme of the conference will
be “Church Co-operation,” which
will be the subject of an address by
Dr. A. W. Palmer, minister of the
First Congregational Church of Oak
Park. Various groups will meet to
discuss the different aspects of
Church Co-operation.

Significant social problems will be
the topics for the luncheon forums
after which the Rev. Reinhold Nei-
buhr of Detroit will speak on “An
Aggressive Faith.” The afternoon
will be given over to election of of-
ficers and reports of committees and
discussion groups.

ANDERSON LEAVES

versity’s representative to the Mid-
West Student Conference, left Sunday
night on the 6:30 train for New Or-
leans where the conference is to be

WANTED: A MARSEILLAISE

KTEW COLLEGE SONGS—songs with indivdu-
’ ality, a tune, and a minimum of hackneyed
words—are something that our <norale needs.
Too many colleges try to cheer on their athletic
teams with songs that have no vigor, or have
long since lost it. They sing stilted, grandiloquent
lines to melodies that are no longer inspiring. Or,
they devise songs that try to be unique, but still
fail to stir the heart.

Chicago shares this need. Dr. Lewis’s Alma
Mater is as noble and genuinely dignified a col-1
lege hymn as we have heard; but our more in-
formal songs are weak. When the news-film
shows a Wisconsin football team, the organist
knows what to play; when a Chicago team ap- i
pears on the screen, he is in a quandary. There
is no song that connotes Chicago wherever it is
heard.

“Our Chicago," the song that won the Women s
Athletic association’s prize, made its appearance
in the bookstore yesterday. Tonight the women
of the University will try it at a Federation sing.
We haven’t yet heard ‘‘Our Chicago" played or
sung. . (There is no piano in Ellis hall; and we
are no Edward Moore anyhow.) .We therefore.

When such a song is written, whether by a
offer no first-night review. .We can only tell, in
amateur fashion, what such a song ought to be.
loyal alumnus or a hired lyricist, whether for a
prize contest or for a Friars’ show, Chicago will
recognize it.

ENGAGES PURDUE

IN RETURN GAME

Fear Spradling’s Eye For
Baskets Will Beat

Locals Again

With Purdue scheduled for Wed-
nesday night and Illinois on. the bill
for the coming Monday evening
Coach Norgren’s Maroon clad bas-
keteers face two of the hardest and
most important games of the current
season. While almost definitely put
out of the conference race the locals
still have a chance of finishing in
the first division and are more than
liable to upset some of the dope dur-
ing the remainder of the season.

Need McDonough

The outcome of Boilermaker en-
counter on the Lafayette floor de-
pends a lot on the fitness of John
McDonough, the stellar sophomore
guard. Without him the Maroons
seem to lack the backbone of their
defense. He has been more or less
incapacitated for the last three
games due to a bad leg, but if his
recovery can be hastened enough to
put him in condition for the Wed-
nesday game the Maroons may pull
out of their present slump.

A great deal will also rest on the
ability of the Maroon guards to stop
the sensational George Spradling, at
present high scorer of the confer-
ence. If he repeats his performance
of several weeks ago in Bartlett gym ,
the Maroons are due for their fourth
straight defeat.

Meet Illini

Coach Norgren will take his eagers
to Urbana on Monday to engage the
fast stepping Illini. By virtue of ।
their successive defeats of Purdue
and Illinois the downstaters are now ।
firmly entrenched in second place,
having outsted Michigan. The Nor-1
grenites scored a victory over Illi-
nois earlier in the season in Bartlett
but with Ruby’s men fighting for the |
title they will encounter an entirely
different team.

In one of the most thrilling games j
ever staged on the local floor the
Maroons dropped their third straight
game to the Badgers Saturday night
by a close score of 26 to 23. The loss
of McDonough handicapped the Chi-
cago team a great deal although Far-
well who subbed at his position for
a short time gave a real exhibition
and should develop into a fine guard.

MINNESOTA NATATORS
BEAT LOCALS; BREAK
CONFERENCE RECORD

Minnesota swimmers ducked the
local contingent to the tune of 51-18
for their third straight loss. The fast
Gopher relay team broke the confer-
ence relay record in 1:16 3-5. The
Maroon splashers did not take to the
cold weather up north and failed to
put up their expected strong showing.

Noyes won the hundred in fast time
and Mygdall copped the breastsroke.
That was the best the Midway nata-
lors could glean from the versatile
Minnesota swimmers. Rittenhouse an!
Diamond also placed in their events.
The team hopes to make a better
showing when they meet Purdue at
Bartlett gym on Feb. 27.

This will he the first meet for the
Maroons in the home tank and accord-
ing to all indications the locals should
sink the Boilermaker swimmers. No-
yes. Rittenhouse, Diamond, Green-
berg, and Mygdall are due to reach
their peak form so that the Maroons
may win their two remaining meets
with Purdue and Illinois on March 6.
The Illini should not furnish as keen
competition us die powerful Gophei
team.

Start Play in Foul
Shooting Tourney

Three fraternities, Lambda Chi
Alpha, Psi Upsilon and Tau Delta
Phi initiated play in the foul shoot-
ing contest, held in Bartlett all this
and next week. Each organization
enters as many men as desired, all
of whom take fifty shots at the bas-
ket during the evening.

The five highest scores are
counted in the fraternity average
and a beautiful loving cup is given
the leading organization at the fin-
ish. The scores are also counted
individually, the high point man of
the tourney receiving a gold medal-
let and the second and third highest
silver and bronze medallets, re-
spectively.

In the evenings play, the aver-
age was not exceedingly high, but
the scores will probably improve
later in the meet.

WHAT o/ IT'

^/GEO<\GE MQI\CEN5Tif\N

I found the Whistle full of more
remarks maligning me last Thurs-
day. I had found such libel there be-
fore; I expect I shall find it in the
future. I am surprised at Terrible
Turk; the tenacity of the fellow’ is
beyond belief. Here (and I appeal to
my supporters for verification of

this statement) I have cracked him |
squarely on the button, not once,
but dozens of times, and left him
prone on the floor. Yet, each time
as soon as the ammonia has brought
him to again, he totters to his feet,
sways dizzily for a moment, and then
swings out blindly, in the hope of
connecting with my chin on some
one of his random failings. (All thh
you understand, is metaphor.)

I suppose my supporters believe
it my part to resort to the usual pun-
itive measures Jbnce again, and
avenge myself for Turk’s latest
senes of scurrilous remarks. But I'
am a humanitarian, I have a merci-
ful heart. I find it beyond me to
bring myself to carry the shambles
further. 1 appeal to Turk’s seconds
(for he himself has not the good
judgment to do so) to throw up the
sponge. I call upon them to carry i
their misguided champion off, to
straight-jacket, to gag him, if need
be. I advise them to sit upon his
kicking form if he show’s resistance,
for I point out to them that the
farther Turk goes, the more pitiful
and inadequate his attempts to deal
me out blow for blow become. I
therefore sum up my advice to them
by saying that Turk’s best policy is
to withdraw, as gracefully as he can
under the circumstances.

For my part, I definitely state i
that I am done w’ith bickering with
Turk. I refuse to have any more
traffic with him. I bid him pass out

And Coach Dan Hoffer’s gym team
goes its merry way. They met Ohio
State last night and the Y. M. C. A.
of Milwaukee in a return engage-
ment Saturday. An unnecessary
statement that they won both meets,
so it will not be made.

Just So, So

Every meet is just another chuckle
for the amiable Mr. Hoffer. The word
“lose” is as foreign to him as is the
word “peace” to the Genna Gang.

The only point of interest concern-
ing the Y. M. C. A. setto was the
fact that the beating our gymnasts
administered to the religiously de-
voted athletes was by a somewhat
larges margin than in the first meet-
ing. And the score of the Ohio State
performance w’as Chicago 1158.5’,
Ohio State 943. Now if the basket-
। ball team made scores like that may-
be we’d be leading that league too.
In plain English the score means that
our boys took every first, second and
third place during the evening’s work
while the visitors made their total
by taking the next three places.

Crowd Get* “Kick”

The crowd could not be called a
typical “collegiate” one. It was com-
posed, for a great part, of old folks
w’ho came to see youth’s physical pow-
ers at their peak. By their clapping
it seemed as if they got more kic«
out of it than some do out of a “Char-
leston” contest—which, by the way,
also demands the physical qualities
not found Very ofteh outside of
youth. Ohy yes, the fencing team
was not so god and lost to the

RELAY CARNIVAL TO

URBANA, ILL., Feb. IS—Thrills
and excitement galore are promised
at the famous indoor relay carnival
of the University of Illinois which
will be run off Saturday, Feb. 27, in
the big university armory. More
than 50 Oathletes, representing 50
universities, colleges and high schools
will compete.

Many out-of-town athletic enthus-
iasts will travel here, attracted by the
announcement that reserved seat
tickets are available to everybody and
may be obtained by mail at the ath-
letic asociation ticket office in Uni-
versity hall.

The main meet will be held at
night beginning at 7:30 and closing
at 9:30. To run the big meet in tw’o
hours is an innovation. The Illini
believe that more people will like
track if mets are run off faster.

TAKES FIRSTS IN
EVERY EVENT OF

INITIAL CARNIVAL

Over Thirty Compete In
Long Delayed Ice
Meet

Plenty of thrills, spills, skill, and
all those things that enter into the
successful holding of an ice-skating
contest, were in order yesterday af-
ternoon when the Intramural Depart-
ment held its First Annual Ice Carni-
val. The South Park Commissioners
called up and said “Yes, we have
ice,” and no time was lost in notify-
ing the 140 entries that the long
postponed skate tourney was to be
held at once.

Held On Short Time

Due to the short notice not all of
the entries were there, but a score
or more of contestants for each of

the events made the competition
stiff enough to provide the swarm
of spectators with very exciting
races. The 220 yd. track was marked

off and put into good shape by the
Park Commissioners, who also lent a
hand in running off the events and

handling the crowd.

Claude Brignail, former Englewood
skater, showed championship form in
running away with the 220 and mile
events. In the latter he came within

5 yards of lapping Syd Collins, who
finished second. He also was a valu-
able man to the Sigma Nu relay

quartet, who won their event to con-
clude the meet and bring their team
total of 26 points, a runaway score.

Sigma Nu Win* Relay

Percy, team mate to Briggie and
co-high point man with him, exhib-
ited some of his All City High school
form, obtained while at Hyde Park,
to win the 440 and half-mile events.
He also helped the Sigma Nu relay
team to take first honors. Nardin,
independent entrant, took a second
in the 440 and a third in the mile, to
take third high point honors.

^ Many Spills

Many spills added to the excite-
ment of the meet. One or more
skaters took a flop in every event,
and in two of them they were ex-
pensive tumbles. In the mile event
Nardin was coming around the last
curve with what looked like a cinch
second place as he was trying at the
time to go around Percy, who won

Spradling to Crack
Conference Record?

With seven games under his belt
and with already seventy five points
chalked up to his credit, George
Spradling, sensational Purdue cau-
tain and at present high point man
of the conference, has an excellent
chance to break the existing all-
time record now held by “Chuck”
Carney for the greatest number of
points scored in a season. Carney’s
record, which was made some years
ago when he captained the Illinois
five, is one hundred twenty points
in a season, or an average of five
field goals per game.

Spradling who is now several
markers ahead of this average to
date, and shows no probability or
slipping, is a direct argument
against the old saying of sports-
men: “They never come back.”
Forced to leave school a couple of
years ago because of poor health.
Spradling has returned and has be-
come the outstanding man of the
year.

OAK PARK LEADS

PREP TRACKMEET

In the last evening of the Annual
Cook County Interscholastic meet,
Oak Park by holding the lead it estab-
lished in the first of the three meet
series, won first place with a total o’
51^ tallies, while Tilden pressed close
with 60 points, thus gaining second
place over Hyde Park which trailed
third with 42 markers for the three
meets. Oak Park won first by rea-
son of Tilden’s defection in the relay,
the last event, in which Hide Park
beat out their .brother south-aiders
and thus kept them from getting the
points necessary for a win.

Patterson of Tilden clinched his
claim to the city’s highest valued title
by again taking high point honors with
firsts in the 50 yard dash and in one
of the quarter miles. Thus be was the
star of the meet with 33 points in a1!
to his credit. Kennedy of U. high took

Easy Win
•	------

Friday night in Bartlett gym the
University trackmen met the best of
Purdue’s mercuries and stepped away
from them rather neatly for a 48-38
win. Both teams had previously beaten
Indiana’s outfit by almost identical
scores and thus the betting was even
when the meet started. But as the
affair wore on it became apparent that
Chicago had a big edge on the Purdue-
men although the score itself wasn't
quite as overwhelming as the Chicago-
ans would have liked it.

Cusack Ill

This was due in the main to the
fact that Captain Jim Cusack ran
under the handicap of a slight illness
which enabled Little, star distance
man of the Purduitcs, to beat him out
of firsts in the half and the mile events.
The rest of the team however was in

fine shape as was shown by their total
of seven firsts to the Boilermakers
three. They also managed to garner
unto themselves quite a few seconds
and thirds proving that they have a
well balanced team.

Although railway transportation is commonly
thought of in terms of machinery, the human organiza-
tion behind it is far more important than the mechan-
ical instruments required in the production of service.
The three human factors fundamental to railway ser-
vice arc patron, owner and employe. The first-named
demands service, and the second and third produce it.
Each puts something essential into railroading, and
gets—or should get—something of equal value out
of it.

The patron puts in his money by the payment of
rates, and he deserves to receive in return the satisfac-
tory transportation he must have in order to carry on
existence under our modern civilization. The owner
supplies the investment required to build and equip the
railroad, and he deserves to receive in return dividends
comparable to those which investments in other fields
would yield him. The employe puts in the labor neces-
sary to make the machinery provided by the owner
produce transportation, and he deserves to receive in
return fair wages and reasonable conditions under
which to work.

The close interdependence of these factors is evident
from the fact that the rates paid by the patron reward
both the owner and the employe, the plant provided by
the owner gives both service to the patron and the
opportunity for employment to the employe, and the
labor of the employe gives a going value to the plant of
the owner and likewise renders service to the patron.
All these factors are indispensable not only to the con-
tinuation of the service but likewise to the success of
one another.

The link joining these three interests and actually
operating the railroad—originally representative of the
owners, but increasingly responsible to the patrons and
the employes—is the railroad management. With the
government as final authority on rates and wages, it is
the duty of the management to provide efficient service
under p.oper working conditions, pay all operating ex-
penses, taxes, rentals and interest on bonded indebted-
ness and still have something left for dividends and for
investment in the property in order to expand for
future needs.

Such conflict as has arisen among the three human
factors interested in railway service has concerned it-
self mainly with the monetary items of rates, wages
and dividends. There has been much less discussion of
the things the money has paid for—the amount and
quality of transportation, the adequacy and efficiency
of equipment and the skill and willingness of labor—
which is a good sign that the foundation of railway
sendee is secure. In connection with the monetary
items, it should be well to remember that the test at
any time of what is high or low or what is reasonable
or unreasonable in rates, wages and dividends is not
necessarily a comparison among these items themselves
or a comparison of each with what has been paid be-
fore; the real test is the relationship these items bear
to the current costs of other services and of com-
modities, to dividends in other lines of investment and
to wages in other lines of work. A money payment is
high or low only by such a test of contemporary com-
parison.

Constructive criticism and suggestions are invited.
