Cap and Gown For 1926 Makes Campus Debut

COMBINE MANY
NEW FEATURES

IN YEAR BOOK

Devote Special Section to
Student Index in Back
of Book

The Cap and Gown is out today.

It’s a very original book in many
ways say the editors, for it includes
many new ideas and some features,
such as the student index, which
have never been used before. This
student index is printed at the back
of the book and mentions every one
who appears in any part of the book.

In the new edition much more at-
tention is given to athletics than is
usually the case, intramurals being
stressed particularly. There are sev-
eral pictures of each of the football
games, while all the Intramural win-
neds are shown in a section devoted
to them.

Picture Friars

Blackfriars is represented by pic-
tures of both this year’s and last
year’s shows, a new feature, for in
the past only one show has been de-
scribed. The leading actors and the
important officers of the order are
shown.

The book is bound in imitation
leather and opens with several cam-
pus scenes. The first section of the
book is devoted to the officers of the
administrative departments, such as
the dean of the coleges, the officers
of the medical schools, and the offi-
cers of the graduate schools.

Senior Section

Seniors are the next to receive at-
tention. Another idea newly incor-
porated in the book is a section de-
voted exclusively to the undergradu-
ate seniors who are at present taking
work in the law school.

FEDERATION PLANS
SOCIAL HOUR, SING,

FOR LAST MEETING

In place of the customary open dis-
cussion meeting, Federation will
sponsor a sing at its last council meet-
ing of the quarter, Tuesday at 7 in
the library of Ida Noyes hall. A social
hour will follow the singing. Although
Federation has never before held a
social after an open meeting, the idea
fits in well with the purpose of the
organization which is to establish a
friendly feeling among women, ac-
cording to Catherine Rose, chairman
of the social committee.

Since this is the first affair of the
kind that Federation has arranged it
is hoped that a representative group
of women will attend.

Columbia Confers Honorary Degree
of D. S. Upon Pres. Max Mason

A high honor came to the Univer-
sity on June 1 by the conferment upon
President Max Mason of the honorary
degree of Doctor of Sciences by Co-
lumbia university. The degree was
awarded in recognition of President
Mason’s distinguished accomplish-
ments in the field of mathematics and
in university administration.

So read the speech of Dr. Nicholas
Murray Butler, president of Columbia
as he conferred the honor:

“Max Mason: a native of Wisconsin,

TOM ECK RETAINS
OPTIMISTIC MOOD

“Tom Eek’s condition remains
about the same,” according to the
daily bulletin issued by the Cook
County Hospital early last eve-
ning.

Thus by a super-human effort,
the veteran trainer of the Univer-
sity athletic teams continues to
hold on to the last threads of life.
But even though those threads may
be frail, Tom’s spirit dominates his
weakened physical condition and
holds on. Holds on, not with the
pessimistic attitude that would pre-
vail in most men, but with the
same spirit that made him so many
friends wherever he was known.

And when the old gentleman
does lose the last hold on life he
assures everyone that he will go
the same way he has lived—with a
smile. In the meantime he holds
on, with the determination to see
and greet his old associates in the
same manner he used to when he
was located under the stadium.

YEAR BOOK TO

ELECTMONDAY

Staff Organization to Take
Place Immediately

Since the work of the year has
been completed, the organization of
next year’s Cap and Gown staff is
now going on. Elections to the posi-
tions of editor, managing editor,
women’s editor, and art editor will
be held Monday and the rest of the
staff that will put out next year’s
book will be selected and arranged.

Since the work of this year’s un-
derclassmen has been so efficient and
since so many of them have been
competing, there is bound to be a
great deal of thought surrounding the
selections, according to John Meyer,
at present editor of the book.

All sophomore members of the staff
will meet at the office on Friday of
this week. The business of the meet-
ing has not been announced, but of
course it will be concerned with next
year’s edition. Since this year’s vol-
ume has been so good it is expected
that next year’s staff will try doubly
hard to put out a first-arte edition.
Just what form their efforts will take
is not yet known.

Said John Meyer yesterday: “Now
that the year’s work is over I am be-
ginning to wonder just how we can
select our staff for next year with-
out doing somebody a grave injus-
tice. Everyone has tried hard and
done efficient work this year.”

President Mason
Host At Annual

Senior Reception

Pres, and Mrs. Max Mason will en-
tertain the graduates and their friends
at the traditional Convocation Recep-
tion to be held on Monday, June 11,
from 9 to 11 in Hutchinson hall. The
reception will be held out of doors if
the weather is fair, but in the com-
mons it it is unpleasant.

All seniors will wear caps and gowns
to the affair, it has been decreed by
Allen Miller, president of the graduat-
ing class. Although this has never be-
fore been done, it has been adopted to
solve the difficulty of whether to
dress formally or informally. There
will be absolutely no exceptions to the
rule.

The reception will be the last social
function which the seniors and their
friends may attend in a body. It will
also be the last opportunity for them
to meet Pres, and Mrs. Mason in a
social way.

All the members of the faculty have
■been invited to attend the reception.
Graduates may take advantage of
this last opportunity of meeting their
professors socially.

Convocation receptions have always
been one of the most widely attended
functions of the University, according
to Miller.

Club To Award
Scholarship For

Work In Spanish

Awarding of an annual scholarship
covering the tuition for one quarter’s
work in Spanish has been planned by
El Circulo Espanol. This scholarship
will be given to a student of the Uni-
versity who has finished nine quarters
of academic work, including at least
thee majors of Spanish, with a B aver-
age-

A committee composed of members
of El Circulo and one faculty repre-
sentative from the Spanish department
will choose the recipient. The scholar-
ship will be given at the end of every
Spring quarter, and will take effect
during the following Fall quarter.

FACULTY CHILDREN
FROUC AT ANNUAL

GREEN HALL PARTY

More than sixty children of faculty
members, the eldest seven years of
age, will frolic and romp through the
corridors of Green hall this afternoon
at the annual children’s party given
by the dormitory.

The tradition of holding a children’s
party originated officially, although the
affairs have been given in various
women’s dormitories on campus. When
Beatrice hall on 57th Street was built,
the parties were held there. With the
erection of Foster, the first of the halls
to be built on the Quaarangle, the
affairs were given there for many years
until Miss Marion Talbot, former dean
of women became supervisor of Green
hall.

Sons of prominent faculty members
including A. Stagg, Jr., Paul MacClin-
tock, instructor in geology, and
Holmes Boynton, an undergraduate,
remembers having attended these par-
ties years ago.

PRELIMINARY TRIALS ON STAGG FIELD;

ENTERTAIN PREP MEN FOR TWO DAYS

Broadcast Vodvil Before
Prep Performance

Over WMAQ

A few of the numbers from the
Senior Vodvil will be broadcast over
WMAQ. the University broadcasting
station, this evening from 8:30 to

8:45. The performance for the Inter-
schobstic men will be given Saturday’
night.

Miss Joanna Downes and Harriet
Handschy will sing two of the num-
ber from the Moonlight act. One of
the numbers was composed by Fred
I von Ammon for the Blackfriars show.

The sax sextette which also appeared
in the Blackfriar production will be
on the broadcasting program and
some songs played by John Wild and
sung byr Clyde Keutzer will also be
on the broadcasting program.

At the last moment there has been
some new features added to the Vod-
; vil. In the Tea Room scene there
vill lite a dance by Esther Cook and
Joe McMartin. Don McGinnis will
sing some lyrics on College Life which
were composed by Bertha Ten Eyck,
Janies and Dan Rich. Elizabeth Wells
will do a clog dance, and an acrobatic
stunt by Jerry Quinn, Joe Barron and
Bert McRoy will conclude the act.

"Dancing in the Moonlight With
You,’ ’one of the songs in the play
| written for Blackfriars by Fred Hand-
schy and Walter G. Williamson will
be sung in the Moonlight number.
Other features of the Moonlight act
will be a masked dance, a toe ballet,
and some new dance hits played by
Fred von Ammon.

ARTIST CARICATURES

SENIORS IN ‘TINAL”
NUMBER OF PHOENIX

Making its last bow to the campus
until next October, the Final issue of
the Phoenix, ultra-snappy in every de-
tail, will be out -next Thursday morn-
ing.

The outstanding feature of this is-
sue, according to Fred Handschy, edi-
tor, will be a number of caricatures of
prominent members of the Senior
I class, dashed off by a universally’
I known artist. The name of this artist
will be the thirty-fourth and last Phoe-
nix mystery, and will not be made
public until Phoenix saleswomen begin
| work early Thursday’ morning.

In addition to this, the Phoenix has
a number of surprises to spring in the
form of poems, jokes and illustrations.
It was the original purpose of the staff
to obtain for this issue, the last with
which a number of them including
Handschy will be connected, the pick
of campus talent in every detail.

Award Medals In

Mandel Saturday

Medals to all place winners and
the team winners of both the high
school and academy divisions of the
Interscholastic will be awarded fol-
lowing the events in Ida Noyes and
Hutchinson commons on Saturday
evening. Coach Stagg will make
the presentations.

MOONLIGHT DANCE
CULMINATES MEET

Dancing with the moon as the
sole source of light, with Clyde
Keutzer’s melody-mad band play-
ing soft waltzes, snappy fox-trots,
and fast one-steps, with many of
the most attractive women on cam-
pus as partners, within a space that
is noted as the beauty spot of cam-
pus, yet large enough to accommo-
date a huge crowd—such is the en-
tertainment that is in view for the
Interscholastic men after the Senior
Vaudeville on Saturday night.

Refreshments, consisting of wa-
fers and ice cream will be served
everyone by members of Sign of
the Sickle. Sophomore women’s
honorary’ society.

FINALS HELD IN
SOLDIERS’ FIELD

I Provide Busses for Athletes
Tomorrow

Finals in the twenty-second edition
of the World’s Greatest Interschol-
astic are scheduled to take place to-
morow afternoon on Soldiers’ Field,
Grant Park. The preliminaries will
be over this afternoon and only the
final heats held down town.

The meet will be held in conjunc-
tion with the annual R. 0. T. C. tour-
nament of the Chicago high schools
which is under the direction of Major
Beale. Twenty corps representing as
many schools are participating, and
a band will accompany every corps.

The contestants in the Interschol-
astic will be taken down town from
campus in double-deck busses, the
first one leaving Bartlett gymnasium
at 12 o’clock and the others will fol-
low at short intervals. Busses will
be at the gates of the Grant Park
stadium to transport the athletes
back after the meet. The banquets,
Senior Vaudeville and the moonlight
dance will use up the evening.

DRAW BOOKS FROM
FRIDAY TO MONDAY
BY COUNCIL RULING

At last the new regulation has
come, Students taking books out of
Harper E-ll after 5 in the afternoon
on Fridays may from now on keep
them until 9:15 the following Mon-
day morning.

This was the announcement made
through that library yesterday. It
came because of agitation for per-
mission to keep reserved books over
the week end which has been going
on under the leadership of the Un-
dergraduate Council for a long time.
The new ruling will go into effect to-
morow night and will remain in force
next year.

Wendell Bennett, president of the
Undergraduate Council, when told
that the University Libraries had ac-
cepted the Council’s suggestion, said:
“Good. I’m sure that the new plan
will save all undergraduates a great
deal of trouble—not to say money,
for many of us have been needlessly
paying fines for books kept over the
entire week end.”

Balanced Teams To
Compete For

Prizes

By George Morgenstern

Qualifying trials in the dashes,' hur-
dles and field events this afternoon
on Stagg Field will start off another
Stagg Interscholastic—the biggest of
them all. Part of the seven hundred
men in the high school division and
the two hundred entries in the acad-
emy section will get into action today,
and the rest of them tomorrow. By
night time, too, hamlets in thirty states
will know whether the home town
hopes have come through for tomor-
row’s finals.

Colorado Favored

Fort Collins, Colorado, the team
that pulled out with the meet a year
ago, is again the favorite, but there
are a lot of other strong teams in the
nation-wide gathering, and the Lamb-
kins haven’t just cause to reserve
space in the baggage car going home
for the first place cup for a little while
yet, a*- least. Fort Collins pulled a
coup in last year’s meet by drilling
half the team in the hammer throw,
an event on only the Stagg 'Interscho-
lastic program among almost all high
school meets, and the nine points that
the westerners took there when three
men placed decided the meet. Probably
there will be a lot of coaches this time
! with the same idea the Fort Collins
coach had a year back.

Teams On Par

In the academy section, Culver,
winner of the meet last year, is stack-
ing up no better in the advance rat-
ing than St. John’s. Lake Forest, the
one school that is in the three-cornered
battle for the academy title every year,
hardly seems as well balanced as us-
ual. St. John's has the highest entry
—twenty-six men.

Wichita, with a well-banlanced team
strong both on the track and in the
field events, and Tech High of At-
lanta, are figured to give Fort Collins
a real battle in the high school section.
For the first time -since 1923, when
Gene Goodwillie ran U. High into
the championship, a Chicago school
has a good chance of coming through.
Senn, with a national record-holder in
Rodgers, hurdler, and a squad that
was good enough to take the state
meet, ought to finish well up.

Finals in the javelin, discus and
hammer in both divisions will be held
this afternoon, while the qualifiers in

THE BRAID OF WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS

THREE women s organizations have been functioning on campus
* since almost the University’s history. As usually happens when
three groups, equally independent and equally powerful strive to
further their respective interests, there has resulted instances of over-
lapping and of friction. No one organization would admit that some
of its duties would be more efficiently managed if taken over by one
of the other two that had, probably, more facilities for undertaking
the particular work. The result was, of course, that women’s activ-
ities were at a comparative standstill.

A few of the more progressive women realized that an execu-
tive board would have to be organized whose primary function
would be the installation of a co-operative spirit among the three
groups. Two years ago, the Board of Women’s Organizations came
into existence. It was composed of a chairman, the presidents and
secretaries of Federation, Y. W. C A., and W. A. A., and six mem-
bers-at-large.

Immediately, a thorough housecleaning was held in the three
organizations. The tapper-class counsellor duty, the obvious sphere
of Federation, was taken away from the Y. W. C. A. and given to
the former organization, in whose hands it has become one of the
most efficient activities of its kind in universities. The Federation
sewng room was taken over by Y. W. Although W. A. A. did not
give up or take on any duty, it began to emphasize its social aspects
as well as those of an athletic nature.

The three groups were asked to co-operate in Freshman Week,
and have helped to make this event one of the most important in
the school’s extra activities. Conflicting events were re-arranged by
the Board to the satisfaction of the three parties. Finally, joint meet-
ings and social affairs have been sponsored by the Board at which
members of the different organizations come together and learn of
the work of all three.

The Board of Women s Organizations is one of the least adver-
tised groups on campus. Its existence and work are probably known
only to those who are in direct contact with it. However, its splen-
did accomplishments are visible in every phase of women’s activ-
ity. It is functioning silently but effectively. Perhaps in time, it will
come to hold a place as prominent in undergraduate activities as the
undergraduate council. At present, it is in an embryonic stage. Its
growth will depend in part on the support and appreciation accord-
ed it by the campus at large.

Dear Turk:

The trouble with our system of

PASS BATONS IN THREE NEW RELAYS

SIX MAROONS IN

Cusack and Burg to Lead
Squad in Soldier
Field Meet

As soon as this week’s prep ath-
letic flurry clears away Chicago is
due for another flurry—this second
one being a collegiate flurry—in fact

meets have been held at Chicago and
it has come to be one of the biggest
closing features of each track year.

Formerly on Staff

The meets, up until this year, were
all held on Stagg field, but owing to
the building operations on the new
stadium and the torn up condition
of the track it will not be possible
to run the events on the University
grounds this year, so the Grant Me-
morial stadium in Grant Park has
been chosen for the affair. This will
give the competitors every possible
convenience and it is hoped that it
will give an opoprtunity for attend-
ance to many of the downtown fans.

Chicago will enter a six man team
in the meet. Captain Jimmy Cusack
will be the Maroon bid in the middle
distance runs and it is hoped that in
the face of the competition he will
meet that he will return to his old
form. Anton Burg, already hailed
as the country’s best high jumper,
will go after that official title in the
high jump event at the meet.

Morrison Runs Hurdle#

Joe Morrison, the new barrier top-
per who has been placing regularly
in all of the meets this year is en-
tered in his specialties—-the high and
low hurdlers. He is known as a com-
ing hurler and he may spring a sur-
prise at the big classic.

Bert McKinney, Chicago’s stellar
high point man, is entered in the
broad jump. McKinney started
rather late in the season and he will
have a real fight in the Intercollegi-
ate. Olwin and Rouse are the Stagg
weight entries. Both of them have
been doing real heaving in the dis-
cus and hammer events but their
chances in the big competition little
is known.

Last year fifty-one colleges and
universities sent nearly two hundred
competitors to the fourth National
Intercollegiate meet and this year
all indications seem to point to an
even larger list of entries. Teams
from almost all of the states and the
district of Columbia are expected to
enter and the battle for points will
certainly be keen. Preparations are
being made now for receiving and
housing the numerous entries as they
arrive for the meet, acording to Mr.
Stagg, the director.

ALL WOMEN’S ATHLETIC TEAMS
PARADE HELD DAY IN COSTUME

Thirty-six volleyball teams, two
field and track teams and one honor
baseball team dressed in fancy cos-
tume accompanied by the University
band will take part in a parade which
will be the initial event of the annual
Women’s Field day which will be held
Tuesday at 3:45 on Dudley Field.
This parade, which takes place each
year, was omitted last year on account
of the death of President Burton.

Mrs. Boucher, Miss Dudley, head of
the physical education department and
Josephine Sebbold, chairman of Field
Day will act as judges of the most
original costume. The winning team
will be awarded a prize by W. A. A.,
the costume rated second will be given
honorable mention and the costume





Barnes, Iowa Coach,
. Here for Trackmeet

Harrison Barnes, former Maroon
basketball and football star, is vis-
iting the campus and will take in
the Interschoiastic, Barnes is a
coach in Iowa, and is getting a few
eyefuls of the cream of America’s
prep talent who are performing
here today or tomorrow.

Barnes will root for Cedar Rap-
ids, which won the meet two years

along with Fort Collins, Colo., last
year's winner., is conceded a strong
chance to win Stagg’s classic. They
are strong in the sprints and weight
events and also boast a crack relay
team.

Rushing of the Interschoiastic boys
has recently been given considerable
notoriety in this column. Especially
has the topic been taken up in labor-
iousc detail from the angle of the
woman’s sub-committee. Hints as to
the insidious purpose of this secret
body leaked out through the porous
medium of this space some days back.
But, in retrospection. I feel now that
I have been unjust to the belles of the
campus and such other young ladies
as happen to be on the committee.
Indeed, I have done them a grave
wrong (in print, of course), and I am
hastening to make amends.

In my former statement of the case,
I pointed out that there seemed to be
a darker, more sinister purpose in this
women’s rushing committee than
would seem to be the ease to one who
did not look beneath the surface of
the matter. In the announcement of
purpose of the committee given out
’by Tom Mulroy and Catherine Fitz-
gerald, there was frequent mention of
“moonlight dance,” “keeping the boys
well entertained,” and similar inuendos.
With such a program in prospect, it
was little wonder I cut loose with the
prediction that a lot of the high school
hoys would find their way into the dear
old school.

most lacking in originality will be
awarded the “booby” prize. Each term
has assumed a ridiculous name and
will choose costumes to carry out the
effect of their title.

The other events which have been
scheduled to follow immediately after
the parade are the volleyball interclass
games and the field and track events
which include the fifty yard dash, dis-
cus and javelin throwing, broad jump,
hopstep jump, hundred yard dash and
hurdle.

At five-fifteen the honor baseball
team will play the alumni team to be
followed by a box lunch supper. All
alumni have been invited to attend the
supper. Tickets may be procured

Oregon Athlete
Runs Mile For
Sception; Is Here

By Victor Rotems

The stories that the athletes com-
peting in these Greatest Interscholas-
tics have to tell about what happened
back home before they were able to
enter the meets are sometims amusing,
sometimes, pathetic and always inter-
esting.

In Zanesville. Ohio, last winter the
students of the high school there
raised in revolt, were given conscien-
tious support by the townspeople,
caused the resignation of the superin-
tendent of schools, and finally succeed-
ed in sending their basketball team
here.

Tale of Garrett

A story equally as absorbing is cited
in connection with the coming of the
Hood River, Oregon, delegation to the
track meet. It seems that the team-
mates and coach of Ernest Garrett,
Hood River miler, thought that Gar-
rett was all that a mile should be. And

all for his entering the Interschoiastic.
“Show Us”

They promptly besieged the business
men of the town for financial contri-
butions to cover the expenses inciden-
tal to a trip to and fro from the Big
Town. The friends lauded the abil-
ities of Garrett in warm terms but
the business men were skeptical. "We
are business men, show us.’*

So it was arranged that Garrett
would run on the rough high school
track, and if his efforts were satisfac-
tory to the Captains of Industry these
gentlemen would slap him friendly on
the back in the way of moral encour-
agement, and reach into their pockets
in the way of financial encouragement.

SECOND PLATOON IS
VICTOR IN PUSHBALL;
WINS CAMPUS TITLE

Greenview Field was trampled over
a-plenty yesterday afternoon as the re-
sult of the push ball tourney by mem-
bers of the Second and Fourth pla-
toons.

The Fourth platoon held the lead at
the first quarter by a 3 to 0 count but
the Second platoon men staged a des-
perate rally and crept up from beneath
the loser's stand to the winner’s gon-
fallon of fame. Captain E. Mattick,
leader of the winning team played a
remarkable game and is responsible
for the turning of the score tide.
Bench, Captain of the Fourth platoon
did his best to keep in the lead, but
the superior teamwork and horseman-
ship of Mattick’s crew proved fatal.

■Hid the Hawks wanted to win that
। game. If a game goes past the

He succeeded in missing the first
wo, and becoming over-confident
dosed his eyes on the third. He
swung wild, but hit the ball for a
single. He couldn’t miss. The Ma-
roon hurler was too good tor him!

Beta* Play Sigma Nu In
Pre-Finals Today

Beta net sharks eliminated the Pi
Phi Pi raquetteers in a series of sets
that began at three yesterday after-
noon. The final results of the Place-
Fisher combination against Sisson
and Craft of the vanquished was
8-10, 6-1, 6-4. The sets were mighty
lively and all four men displayed
true court talent. The Beta victory
lines its men in the semi-final round,
to play the Sigma Nu netters today.

The Junker-DeBois combination
played a fast match and are to piny
the winners of the Alpha Delt-Zeta
Beta bracket. Francis, playing for
the Alpha Delts, has shown great
skill in handling of difficult shots and
ought to put up a god fight against
Flexner and Shier of the Zeta Beta
netmen.

In the single tournament Hoppe is
to play Junker in semi-final titlts.
Both men are fast on the court and
competition will be too close to guess
at the outcome of the fray. The
winner will play Place, Beta upholder.

Place and Whitney had an interest-
ing match yesterday afternoon which
the former won in great shape. The
final result was 10-8, 6-3, 6-4. Whit-
ney distinguished himself at the net
work which he performed with ter-
rific speed. Place, however, was too
fast for his opponent and managed
to return every tricky shot by dis-
playing a brand of tennis that will
insure him of a second man role on
the Varsity next year.

I-M DEPARTMENT HOLDS MEETING
TO DISCUSS SEASON’S ELECTIONS

Doc Molander, faculty head of the
Intramural Department called a meet-
ing of his Junior and Senior man-
agers yesterday afternoon to hold a
round-table discussion on the matter
of the coming election which will se-
lect the officers for next year.

That such a meeting should be held
preparatory to the election emphasizs
the great importance of. the latter, and
is another instance of the will of the
I-M department, under the guidance of
Doc Molander. to always do the right
thing. In this case it is picking the
right man for the right job.

Just a glance at the records of the
men who have held the major positions
during the past year is real evidence

GREATEST TRACK

INTER-SCHOLASTIC

Many Strong Teams Hope
To Break Records
Saturday

By Bob Stern

Track meets may be track meets,
starts may be stars, and the individual
events may be whizzes, but—the re-
lay’s the thing. Ask anybody: and if
they are real track fans they will tell
you that each Interschoiastic or for
that matter each little track meet has
one stupendously thrilling moment—
the moment just before the running
of that last race—the relay. The score
is traditionally and usually tied up in
knots and the result is up in the air.
Then the crack of the last pistol conies
and the relay men spurt down the
cinders passing baton after baton to
each other with that deadly intense ac-
curacy. and the crowds in the stands
rise from uproar to frenzy . . .—
That’s the real part of a track meet.

Relays Hold Interest

• And that’s why the Interschoiastic
finals on Saturday are going to hold
such a whirlwind interest—for there’s
not only going to be the one final
really outstanding. Their record in
brand* new relays—and each one of
them is going to be a thriller in itself
The main reason for that outside of
the big reason—the Interschoiastic it-
self is the .calibre of the teams that
are entered.

There’s a team here from Galesburg
high down in Galsburg, Illinois, that’s
really outstanding. Their record is
particular is impressive—for they won
the Kansas relay;, the Drake relays,
and the Wisconsin Intercholatic break-
ing all sorts of record in the doing of
all this. They will be on hand tonight
to compete on Saturday.

Vernon Squad Fast

Then there’s another great relay
combination here from Vernon High
of Vernon, Texas. Undefeated in eith-
er the mile or the two mile relays this
year they have entered both of these
events. During th early part of this
season, they set four records at. the
Texas relay carnivals, one State record
in Onlahoma. three Missouri records
and one world record. All of which is
augmented by the fact that the anchor
man on their team is Crouch, who
won the half mile here in 1926.

The Columbus, Ohio record break-
ing half mile quartet that holds the
Interschoiastic record of 1:30 8-10
came in this morning. They have the
two Simpson brothers, Armstrong
and Peters on their team; the first three
are reputed to have registered under
23 second in the 220 and their baton
passing is almost perfect.

the Birmingham A. A. U. Meet in the
440 with 52 flat, Bradwell who did
22 9-10 in the 220 to win the Georgia

All sizes. Special Friday and Saturday...................

Several full teams began pouring in
yesterday. Little Rock. Arkansas, ar-
rived with twelve men including their
weight stars. Of these Grandon who
won the state meet with a javelin
throw of 184 feet and Holt who heav-
ed the hammer 184 feet and the dis-
cus 125 feet appear to the best bets.

Then came Fort Collins of Colorado
twelve strong—the weight men in a
car and the runners by train. Fort
Collins was the winner of last year's
National High School Track Title at
Chicago. This year they were unable
to raise the necessary rail funds so
ten of them came in automobiles.

Witchia High of Witchia. Kansas,
looms up as another strong title team.
They won every dual meet and also
won the Kansas State Meet. Kansas
University Relays. Southwestern In-
terscholastic meet at Winfield. Kansas,
and the Missouri Valley Interscholas-
tic at Manhattan. Kansas. Among the
stars who are expected by them to win
points on Friday and Saturday is
Capt. Updagraff who won the 220 yd.
low hurdles at the Missouri Valle}
Meet last Saturday in 24 4-5, setting a
new meet record. Bausch, their pole
vaulter, won the Kansas Relay event
by vaulting 12 fe. 31-2 inches. Bausch
also put the shot 51 feet, 6 inches in
the Missouri Valley Meet, and threw
the discus 131 ft. Their half mile re-
lay team holds the record of 1:31 in
an unofficial time trial in preparation
for the meet at Chicago. The team is
composed of eight men and the coach.

Another powerful team is Atlanta
Tech High of Atlanta. Georgia, who
has won the Southeastern A. A. U.
Interscholastic, Swance Interscholas-
tic and Georgia State Interscholastic
held at the University of Georgia.
