SOLUTION FOR
CHILD MALADY

SOUGHT HERE

Professors Bent On Solving
Infantile Paralysis

Problem'

The first step of a long flight of
experimental stairs leading to the
solution of the infantile paralysis
problem, one of the most baffling in
modern research has been ascended
by two University physiologists, it
became known today. Equally impor-
tant is another aspect of the same
experiment which points to prenatal
experimentation in the not far dis-
tant future.

Dr. R. W. Gerard and Dr. Theo-
dore Koppanyi cut the spinal cord
of a rat in the pre-natal stage and
found that the lesion had completely
healed at birth. This is the first time
the severed cord of a mammal has
regenerated, and one of very few
instances in scientific history where
operations have been successfully
performed on animals in the prenatal
state.

Has Direct Bearing

That the experiment has a direct
bearing on the infantile paralysis
problem is shown by Prof. A. J. Carl-
son, head of the physiology depart-
ment who points out that actual de-
struction of nerve cells in the cord
occurs in infantile paralysis, subse-
quently destroying the muscles of
the leg. If investigators can get back
to the physiologico-chemical changes
that determine regeneration of the
cord fibers once something has sepa-
rated them, they will be well along
on the way toward control of the
disease, he says.

The research just completed would
indicate that such investigations are
possible although their working out
might require a century more, Prof.
Carlson thinks.

INSTALL CITIZENSHIP

COMMITTEE IN Y. W.

Y. W. C. A. announces the forma-
tion of a new committee on citizen-
ship, of which Margaret Roberts will
be chairman, Miss Roberts was ap-
pointed to the post by the officers
and first cabinet of the organization
because of her interest in women’s
citizenship, according to Helen
Wooding, president of Y. W.

The purpose of the committee is to
bring campus women into closer con-
tact with the political world, which
their vote will open to them.

Procure Tocques
at Bookstore for

Dollar a Throw

Tocqucs have arrived! This was the
announcement given out by the Uni-
versity bookstore yesterday. They may
now be obtained at this store, and
every member of the undergraduate
body, whether he be insignificant fresh-
man or lofty senior is expected to buy
one.

“We are very anxious to see this
colorful custom revived among the
undegraduates,” said Charles Ander-
son, president of the Undergraduate
J council.

For seniors, the cap is all maroon;
juniors have maroon with a white but-
ton; sophomore tocques are white with
a maroon button, and frosh have the I
traditional green and maroon. The
tocques are on sale at one dollar apiece.

ZIONIST MOVE

LAUDED IN TALK

Wedgewood Tells Of Condi-
tions In Palestine

“Prosperity in Palestine is increas-
ing rapidly as a result of the Zionist
movement,” said Col. Josiah C.
Wedgwood in an address yesterday in
Harper assembly room. “Larger pro-
duction consumption and exportation,
and a rise in the general economic level
are being effected through the immi-
gration of Jews into their homeland,”
he stated.

In six years 60,000 Jews have settled
in Palestine on land purchased for the
purpose by the Jewish national fund.
With them they brought western
methods and ideas, with the result that
formerly arid spaces are now yielding
large crops. The poor Arabs favor the
movement because they are benefiting
in the introduction of improved meth-
ods and the resulting increase in pro-
duction.

“The iniportanf thing now is to get
as many Jews as possible into Pales-
tine,” said Col. Wedgwood, “so that
when we give them self-government
there will be enough Jews to keep the
leadership from the hands of the Arab
officials. I will not be satisfied until
all the Jews of Russia and Poland have
been emptied into Palestine,” he ended.

EXHIBIT COLLECTION
OF ARMORIAL PLATES
IN HARPER LIBRARY

Several Armorial book plates have
been added to the present University
collection through the recent donations
of Alfred de Sauty and Miss Rose
Sears. They have been placed on ex-
hibition in Harper W31.

Miss Clara Little, University libra-
rian in charge of the collection, asserts
that the collection now numbers about
three thousand distinct plates. The
bulk of the collection consists of book
plates which have their origin in family
coats of arms.

Juniors Open Year
With Class Dinner

For its first official party of the year,
the Junior class will hold a dinner, with
perhaps a dance afterward, on Feb. 11.
An interesting program is beieg ar-
ranged by the entertainment commit-
tee, according to George Weimer,
president of the class.

START CONTEST
TO FIND MOST
HANDSOME M .h

Winner To Receive Ten
Dollars As Cash
Prize

Who is the most handsome man on
campus? And what are the elements
of masculine beauty?

These questions have long re-
mained unsettled by the undergrad-
uates of the University. The Daily
Maroon has therefor organized a con-
test to find the best looking man on
the quadrangles. The contest will
commence today and will last until
a week from Friday.

No ballots will be cast, for a more
efficient method of obtaining the
concensus of campus opinion has
been evolved for the occasion. Ma-
roon reporters will cover the cam-
pus during the next few days, asking
everyone they meet whom he or she
considers the handsomest man in the
undergraduate schools, the reasons
for their choice, and other less im-
portant details.

A prize of ten dollars will be giv-
en the winner.

Question Campus
Authorities About

Male Pulchritude

Prominent campus women, when
questioned as to whom they considered
the handsomest man on campus, an-
swered as follows:

Esther Cooke: Wallie Williamson is
the handsomest man on campus. He
is of the type that I like best.

Another Wallie—Wallie Marks or
football fame—Comes second on my
list Further than this I will not go.'

Josephine Waters: Wallie Marks.
His features are as nearly perfect as
any; not only his face hut his whole
appearance tends to create the impres-
sion.

Harriette Keeney: I think Wallie
Marks is the most handsome. Men
who are athletes are usually the best
in appearance. He has a healty ap-
pearance that is most attractive.

Alice Wiles: In my opinion George
Poole is the handsomest man in school.

Further inquiries wilt be made on
campus during the next week. They
will be published with the consent of
the person asked.

INTERNATIONAL CLUB
ENTERTAINS AT FIRST
MEETING OF QUARTER

International Students association
will hold the first meeting of the
quarter in the form of an interna-
tional party which will be held Fri-
day at 8 in the theater of Ida Noyes
hall.

The party promises to be of inter-
est to all as the entertainment com-
mittee has made plans for games and
songs which are characteristic of the
various countries of the world, ac-
cording to H. Y. Cho, president of
the organization.

“The International Students As-
sociation is attempting to provide the
foreign students with an organiza-
tion through which they can meet
their fellow countrymen,” said Cho,
“and at the same time it forms a
bond among all students from other
countries.”

Students Favor Entrance Into

World Court Final Vote Shows

College students throughout the
country are definitely in favor of the
World Court peace proposition and are
taking what steps they can to urge
the participation of the United States
the World Court.

By a tremendous vote college stu-
dents throughout the nation expressed
themselves in favor of the World Court
in “The New Student” referendum.

The number of students voting was
far above any heretofore recorded on
any issue, the presidential poll last year
having drawn 50,000 votes, from 125
colleges whereas the World Court was
voted on by 128,678 students in 333
colleges. The total student body of
the United States is about 600,000 in
600 schools of genuine collegiate stand-
ing.

Of the 128,678 voting, 100.943 voted
for the Court in terms probably ac-
ceptable to the Administration; 19,895
voted against the Court, and 7,930
voted for the strong Borah reserva-
tions. “Since newspaper men generally
regard the Borah position as opposing
the Court, the total vote could safely
be analyzed as 100,943 in favor and
27,825 against U. S. participation at
the present time.”

Some of the students voted on four
detailed proposals regarding the Court,
arid dome voted simply “for” or
“against.” The detailed vote follows:

1. Those voting on four plans:

For the Hughes-Harding-Cool-

idge Reservations.............39,701

For the “Harmony” Plan of
thirty peace leaders..........21,738

For the Borah reservations.... 7,930

Against present participation.. 12,451

SETTLEMENT DRIVE
HEADS SEE “YOUNG”
BLOOD” NEXT WEEK

“Young Blood,” one of New York’s
biggest hits coming to the Princess,
has been selected as the scene of the
Settlement drive theatre party, sched-
uled for Tuesday evening.

After considering the plays which
are now in town and those that are
coming, the committee in charge chose
the new show, to be certain
that no one in the party had seen it.

“We have reserved the first four
rows in the balcony,” said Seward
Covert, co-chairman of the drive, “and
expect to see one of the year’s best
shows. There will be forty in the
party.”

The Settlement drive theatre party
is an annual occasion in campus activ-
ities. Chairmen of all committees and
members of the two winning teams,
men and women, are the guests.

Since this year’s drive resulted in
the record-breaking, sum of more than
five thousand dollars, those who hate
worked to make it successful, deserve
the party which has been planned, ac-
cording to Covert.

SOPHOMORES HOLD

MIXER ON FRIDAY

Introducing Rainey Bennett’s Syn-
copators, newly (organized campus
orchestra, the sophomore class will

Kretschmer, physician attending
Dean Wilkins, are becoming more
and more favorable. Dr. Kresch-
mer announces that Dean Wilkins’
condition is showing continued im-
provement, and that, unless Some
very unexpected development ap-
pears to change the present rate of
recovery, he will be able to release

RECEPTION HELD
FOR PRESIDENT

Appoint Graham Hagey and
Aimee Graham as
Co-Chairmen

BY STEWART McMULLEN

To further their drive for better
understanding and cooperation be-
tween undergraduate students and
the faculty, the Undergraduate coun-
cil is planning a reception for Presi-
dent Max Mason. It will be given
Feb. 12, at 7:30, in Mandel hall and
Hutchinson Commons.

Although the affair will be spon-
sored by the Undergraduate council,
it’s president, Charles Anderson, de-
clared that the reception will be giv-
en by the entire undergraduate stu-
dent body, and will in no sense be an
exclusively Council affair.

Graham Hagey and Aimee Graham
have been appointed Co-chairmen.

Mason Will Speak

The reception will be one of the
Council’s major projects for the
quarter, according to Anderson, and
will constitute the first official meet-
ing between the students and the--_
president. With the exception of one
of the pep meetings during football
season, which was limited to fans,
this is the first time that the under-
graduate student body has had the
opportunity to hear Dr. Mason speak.

The president will speak to the
students on his impressions of the
University, as they have been shaped
since his arrival. Mr. Frank O’Hara,
director of student activities, and
Prof. Chauncey S. Boucher, of the
department of History, will also
speak.

Student* Will Meet President

Following the speeches in Mandel
hall, a receiving line will form along
the east wall of the Hutchinson din-
ing room, and undergraduate stu-
dents will be given their first official
opportunity to shake hands with their
president. Refreshments will be serv-
ed afterward along the west wall.

It is expected that the co-chairman
will soon appoint student committees
to assist them in managing the af-
fair. Appointments will be announc-
ed in an early issue of The Daily
! Maroon.

DEAN MATTHEWS TO
LECTURE AT SECOND
FELLOWSHIP MEETING

The second of a series of “Why
I Believe” talks, sponsored by the
Y. M. C. A., will be “Why I Believe
in Jesus Christ,” by Dr. Shailer Mat-
thews, and will be given today at
4:30 in room A, Reynolds clubhouse.

After the talk, the meeting will be
open for general discussion, in which
all are invited to participate. This is
a part of the general Y. M. C. A.
“Fellowship Hour” series, intended
especially for those who ordinarily
do not attend any religious gathering
or church, and opei to all men o’
the University.

Tomorrow from 4 to 6 the weekly
open house will be held in the South
Lounge of the Reynolds clubhouse.
Two campus entertainers Clyde
Keutzer of Blackfriars fame, and
John Wild, pianist, will offer several
musical numbers throughout the af-
ternoon. Refreshments will be served.
Men of the University are urged to
attend the open house in order that
they may make the acquaintance of
Y. M. C. A. leaden and members.

ELUDING ELLIS

ATTENDING classes is becoming more hazardous every day.

We are forced to become jay-walkers, acrobats, aviators, ski
jumpers. The traffic on Ellis Avenue between 57th street and
the Midway is becoming so congested that one can no longer cross
that avenue without imperiling his life.

Traffic centers near the public schools are now carefully guard-
ed to protect the pupils, but university students are left to do their
own dodging. Once the University employed a gentleman whose
business it was to remind automobile owners when they violated

parking signs and speed
watches over us.

In order to insure safety, no
autos should be parked near 58th
Street on Ellis and the speed
limit should be less than ten
miles per hour. It is natural for
students to walk with their1
heads down. Their lives should
not be endangered.

If protective measures are not
taken, either by the University
or by the city traffic depart-
ment, some thinking student is
going to awaken from a geome-
try to find himself sprinkled over

regulations, but that officer no longer
Perhaps he found his position too dangerous.

printer had an accent for

Social Sphere

By Alta Cundy

Mrs. Robert V. Merrill, social direc-
tor of the University, completed the
plans for a program which will affect
the social aims of every freshman,
sophomore, junior, and senior in resi-
dence this quarter. Mrs. Merrill was
assisted in the program makeup by the
presidents and vice presidents of the
classes; Allan Miller, and Catharine
Campbell, seniors. George Weimer and
Ellen McCracken, juniors, Paul Lewis
and Helen King, sophomores, George
Poole and Janet Goode, freshmen.

Senior Plans

The Seniors list three events on the
quarter’s calendar which include their
dinner on Jan. 21. a mixer on Jan. 29
in the Reynolds club, and a luncheon
Feb. 11.

The Juniors have differed in their
choice of pleasure by entering a theatre
party for a now undecided date in
March. Their immediate plans are
being concentrated on the class din-
ner Feb. 11 which is in accordance
with planned events of every class.

Sophomore Schedule

The Sophomores however have the
only class program which does not
include this dinner feature while they
substitute a luncheon for Jan. 29.
Their mixer will occur Jan. 22 in the
Reynolds club.

The Freshmen have already enjoyed
their entered affair for this busy
quarter, the class banquet Jan. 15.

Refering a moment to an already
mentioned class feature the Sphere
notes that Thursday evening President
Mason has accepted the invitation of
the Senior Class for dinner at Ida
Noyes hall at 7. Mrs. Edith Foster
Flint and Miss Elizabeth Wallace will
act as hostesses for the evening.

Deke Hard Time Party

For the following evening Friday.
Jan. 22, the pledges of Delta Kappa
Epsilon have issued invitations to the
active members and their guests ask-
ing them to attend the hard-times
party to be given by them at the chan-
ter house. Mr. and Mrs. H. W. Rubin-
kam, Mr. and Mrs. C. A. Dougall, and
Mr. and Mrs. David Florus Meacham
will be hosts and hostesses.

Saturday night brings the annual
scholarship dance of the Delta Sigma
chib: this will take place in the Crystal
Ballroom of the Cooper-Carlton hotel.

IDEALISTS AND THE WORLD COURT

THE World Court got a verdict from college students as free
from political bias as it is possible to get one. But (say the
opponents of the World Court) college students are idealists; what
else could you expect from idealists?

Every great reform was first dreamed by an idealist, defended
and promoted by idealists, often many generations of them, and
finally put across by idealists.

Probably some students voted for a World Court without look-
ing into the matter very exhaustively. They felt that the idea
was right in principle, that if it worked, world catastrophes such
as the recent one might be averted. If that could be done (they
reasoned) what comparatively trivial objections could count
against it? But it seems reasonable to suppose that most of the
students of this and the other universities voting on the Court
have received at least as much information in regard to the mat-
ter, and have weighed the evidence for and against as carefully
as the average business or professional man.

There is such a thing as muddling a question, of throwing out
a smoke screen of technical and imaginary objections, until the
tvhole problem seems confused and obscure. An open-mnided
analysis of the proposition, unbiased by politics or propaganda,
may clear the atmosphere and point the right way.

If this is the verdict of idealists, by all means let us have idealist
verdicts on other vital questions.

Can you remember back in the
days when Will Hough, Joe Howard,
and William Adams were the creators
of sensational musical comedy hits
at the LaSalle theatre, such as
“Honeymoon Trail,’ ’and “Stubborn
Cinderella?”

“Honeymoon,” written, staged,
and produced by Will Hough is at
the Tivoli next week. It is a mini-
ature musical comedy with a score
of musical comedy stars, including
the famous comedian Eddie Hume,
The Scoville Dancing chorus, and
Arline Bolling.

Four episodes make up the pro-

duction.

On the screen, ‘Mannequin,” the
$50,000 prized winning story recent-
ly published in Liberty magazine, is
in the principal attraction. Fannie
Hurst is the author, and Alice Joyce,
Delores Costello, and Warner Bax-
ter are in the principal roles.

The ‘Try If Attitude
Toward

• the Bond Business

SOME college men frankly say they are
going to give the bond business a “try”
—an attitude which suggests lack of con-
fidence, either in the opportunities in this
field, or in themselves.

Before merely “trying” the bond busi-
ness, it would pay to look thoroughly into
its requirements and possibilities—to de-
cide on facts, not on impressions or fancies.
The man who thus carefully chooses his
work in the light of his own qualifications,
gives himself the best chance to succeed.

To help you know more about the bond
business, as a basis for deciding your own
adaptability to it, we have prepared an in-
formative pamphlet which we shall be glad
to send upon request.

With the Big Ten leadership as
the victor’s spoils, Coach Lambert’s
highly-geared Boilermakers quintet
will match its scoring power against
Nels Norgren’s stonewall defense.
The Maroons who, but a week ago
were considered among |,the “also
ran” class will be considered as the
outstanding title contender should
they wallop Purdue tonight.

Purdue Squad Speedy

Likewise Purdue, in accordance
with its practice of hailing baskets
by the dozen, feels itself obliged to
humble the Maroons. To corroborate
their assertions they merely point to
Capt. Spradling as slippery and as
fast a floorman as ever won a “P.”
Then there is Harmeson, football
captain and four sport man, and
Quarterback Tirube, the boy whose
passes last fall gave many Maroons
fans heart disease.

These boys now alternate at for-
ward and are just as good at the
court games as on the grid. Cramer
at center is an uncanny long shot
making but 17 points against North-
western. The guards Wilcox and Jolly
will probably do more shooting than
guarding.

Maroon* Must Guard Closely

As long as the Maroons resort to
the leech-like guarding game they
employed against Wisconsin, a close
battle should result. Babe Alyea,
“Zimmie” and Sackett can keep the
Maroons in front with long, shots.
The insidious thing about the Lafay-
ette system is that they do all their
scoring when the opposition is worn
out late in the second half. On the
shoulders of McDonough and Hoer-
ger, the husky sophomore guards, is

Ten Frosh Trackmen
Annex Green Shirts

Only ten men have won their
green shirts in Freshman track. A
whole army of earnest yearlings has
been trying every night to gain the
honor but although the require-
ments are low not many have been
able to meet them. Perhaps the
excuse offered—that the men are in
poor condition—has something back
of it.

Cross country runners took the
major share of the shirts with Wil-
liams, Burke, Frey, and Ault doing
the necessary time. Kline, and
Strong heaved the shot for their
uniforms; Gist, and Jackson ran
two fast half miles to get theirs;
and Cassie high jumped well over
’he set height for his.

More of the team shirts will prob-
ably be given out before the end
of the week, for last night twenty-
eight were out trying with vigor
and vim to do the set times, heights
and distances.

WHAT of IT?

^EO\CE MORGENSTERN

“Why,” writes Hell Weekender, “do
you not branch out in your column and
go in for all kinds of stuff, instead of
just sports? Your columns on the
election situation were very edifying,
combining as they - did both the ele-
ments of amusements and instruction—
a state of affairs highly commendable
and much to be sought after. I should
advise that you do not allow your
great worth to be wasted solely on
those doings, as we French say, Ie
sport which usually occupy your col-
umn (and in which, to tell the truth,
I am not so greatly interested), but
that you hit a note in the manner of
such talented gentlemen as Mr. Hey-
wood Broun or Prof. James Weber
Lnn.”

All of which, on the whole, is extra-
ordinarily sound counsel. I am led to
believe, however, that the advice at
the end of my correspondent’s com-
munication is beyond possibility of ful-
fillment, for I am not so presumptuous
as to even aim at the high level of such
universal geniuses as my counselor
names. But I shall in my own humble
manner, and in my own sphere, here-
after seek to pen those little things
which would seem best fitted to the
serious task of sending the collegians
home happy. With which base affront
to the memory of Barrett Wendell, I
pass on to other things.

The last two days, I am fain to be-
lieve, have had more than a little of
the touch of spring. The air, long
cold and laden with that particularly
violent species of soft coal dust which
is produced by the university power
plant, was soft and balmy in the ex-
treme. So noble, in fact, was the clim-
ate that I was induced early Monday
to shed not only my hat. hut also my
topcoat, and to emulate such all-
weather collegians as Mr. Don Kelso,
whose expenses in the line of over-
coats and suchlike are, if one may
judge by appearances, practically neg-
ligible. Thus imemeumbered. I saun-
tered gaily along the walks of the dear
old campus, and my joy was to all
practical purposes unconfined.

Nothing, indeed, was needed to
make the spring tableau complete ex-
cept sight of the first robin, but I am
grieved to report that a glimpse of

I-M GRAPPLERS
EXHIBIT WARES

THIS AFTERNOON

Hold Prelims in Bartlett;
Trials Carded for

Tomorrow

Undergraduate wrestlers and
“would-be” wrestlers will have an
opportunity to exhibit their wares
this afternoon at 3:30 at Bartlett
Gymnasium in the preliminaries of
the Intra-Mural Wrestling Contest.
More than sixty Greeks and non-
Fraternity grapplers have signed up
to mix in this afternoon’s bouts,
which will weed out the material for
the finals to be held on Friday of
this week at 3:30 p. m.

Everything Ready

Varsity Wrestling Captain, George
1 Graham, announced that everything
is in readiness for this afternoon’s
contest. Contestants will weigh in
today between eleven and three
o’clock at the second floor locker
room, directly in front of the cage
A man appointed by Wrestling Coach
Vorres will be on hand to check their
weights.

Eight events will be on this after-
noon’s card, the events being in the
following classes: 117, 127, 137, 147,
160, 177 pounds, and heavyweight
division.

Varsity Barred

Attractive medals will be given to
first, second and third men in the
Finals on Friday, and a silver cup
to the winning team. Four men in
each class will be selected for the I
Finals. Varsity and Numeral men are ,
automatically barred, as in other
Intra-Mural Contests, and the affair
should bring some new talent for i
Coach Vorres’ future wrestling
sq tads.

WOMEN BEGIN PLAY
IN INTER-DORMITORY
BASKETBALL LEAGUE

Another set of interdormitory bas- j
ketball games will be played tonight
at Ida Noyes hall between Kelly I
and Beecher, Kenwood and Drexel, I
and Green and Greenwood.

“We are trying to put women’s j
basketball on a scientific basis this
year,” says Miss Alma Wylie, head
of the inter-dormitory games, “and
the teams are rounding up in fine ,
shape, although, it is difficult to
pick the best so early in the season.”
An unusually large number have I
turned out for senior college basket-
ball, which is a purely optional sport,
and all the teams seem to be excep-
tionally good, promising some lively
competition.

HOLD TRIANGULAR

MEET IN BARTLETT

After next Friday evening all of
Tom Eek’s track men will know how
it feels to fight for the honor of the
varsity, for they are going to get this
privilege in their first real meet of
the season, the annual Varsity-Fresh-
man-Alumni contest, which is to be
held at Bartlett on that date.

This meet, held every year to test
the men and experience them for the
coming Big Ten meets, is usually a
close one and it looks as if this year
will be no exception. Intensive prac-
tice by the varsity should help them
greatly to overcome the unlimited
talent from which the Alumni has
to draw, while the many individual
stars on this year’s yearling outfit
will boost the chances of that outfit.

All the events of the regular in-
door season are to be included in this
all-Chicago meet. They are the 50
and 440 yard dashes, the 50 yard low
and high hurdles, the half-mile, mile,
and two-mile runs, the shot put, pole
vault, relay, and high jump.

Freshmen — Sophomores

who want to secure positions in a prominent campus
activity. Who are willing to work hard one hour a day.
And want to get some business experience while they are
still in school. Drope into the Maroon Office any day this
week between 9 A. M. and 4:30 P. M. No experience
necessary. No selling. Drop in today and ask for Fred-
erick H. Kretschmer, Circulation Manager.

DELTA UPSILON, ALPHA DELTA PHI,
KAPPA SIGMA, PSI UPSILON FIVES
WIN LISTLESS TOURNEY CONTESTS

Four Fraternities Forfeit Games in Class A League;
Play Is Rough During Evening;

Few Dope Upsets

Intramural referees blew their
whistles loud and importantly last
night in Bartlett during the playing
of the fraternity basketball games
but outside of a few bad spills noth-
ing occurred to make the evening
an outstanding one. Psi Upsilon
lived up to specifications, when they
pelted the Phi Pi Phi 40-6, while the
Kappa Sigs had a much easier time
than they had expected in lowering
the colors of Sigma Nu 16-7 in a
game replete with bodily contact.
The Sigma Chi’s came through with
the expected when they defeated
the Phi Delta Sigs in a handy fash-
ion, 10-6.

Sig Chi Wins

The Sig Chi’s defeated the Phi
Delts by a score of 10 to 4. The
visitors showed a close defense that
was almost impossible to penetrate
and at the same time their long
shots hit the loop in a spectacular
fashion. Scott, Welty and Duggan
garnered the points for the Sigs
while Johnson did the scoring for
the opponents.

Sigma Nu Upset

The Sigma Nu’s looked upon as
one of the contenders for the cham-
pionship were upset in one of the
roughest games of the tourney. The
Kappa Sigs using a very well de-
veloped passing game worked the
ball down the floor time after time
and then tossed it into the loop from
the region of the foul circle. Schaf-
fer with 3 field goals scintillated for
the winners while Johnson also
gaged two. Stevens and Koeber
were the offensive stars for the los-
ers.

Lott Star*

Psi Upsilon again back in form

after its unlooked for defeat of last
week ran over the Phi Pi Phi’s to
the tune of 40 to 6. George Lott,
star forward regained his eye for
the loop and threw eight ringers.
Freeman and Steward also ran wild
each contributing 6 baskets. The
guarding and floor work of Yeisley
was a feature of the encounter.

Close Game

In a very close game Delta Chi
was defeated by the Tekes by a
close score of 16 to 12. Long bas-
kets featured the game and Don-
nelly with 5 counters was the out-
standing factor in the victory.

Alpha Delts Win

The Alpha Delts continued their
winning streak by downing the Kap-
pa Nu aggregation 25 to 8. Brewer
with 6 field goals and Francis with
4 led the attack of the winners.

Delta Upsilon was victor over Phi
Beta Delta 20 to 9. Long shots
were the determining factors.

Bowling, Basketball,
Swim Classes Carded- -

The department of physical culture
announces the following schedule for
women affiliated with the Univer-
sity: On Tuesday at 7:00 there will

2. Those voting “for” or “against.”*
For 39,504.

Four colleges out of the 333 in the
poll returned majorities against the
Court. They were Galludet College,
District of Columbia, Galesburg Co’
lege, Illinois; Coe College. Iowa; and
the Virginia Military Institute.

Whether a spontaneous movement
or in response to propaganda, the na-
tional collegiate World Court Confer-
ence met at Princeton and registered
the expected large majority for the
World Court. Senator Lenroot in
debate gave the usual arguments for
U. S. entrance into the court, Clarence
Darrow in rebuttal saw nothing in it
for students “to get all het up over.”
Also speaking were General Henry T.
Allen and Dr. George Vincent.

World Court opinion being duly
crystalized a more ambitious program
from 24 colleges and under the leader-
ship of Lewis Fox, Princeton '26 was
born “The National Federation of
Students.” Purposely vague in func-
tion and purpose the “Federation” re-
mains to be developed by its executive
committee and ratified by the various
student bodies. In approving the “Fed-
eration” the delegates registered only
their personal convictions and did not
pledge to any action. Hope was ex-
pressed by the originators of the plan
that the "Federation” would not be
“just another organization” but would
eventually include the entire student
population of the country and be a
means of expressing student opinion.
The “Federation” plans to co-operate
with the “Confederation International

Regeneration of injured tissue in
the nervous cord and brain of prim-
itive forms like the frog and fish has
taken place many times in the past.
University physiologists have watched
a fish recover the use of its fins
after the cord had been severed near
the head. In other laboratories the
same thing has been observed in
frogs. But heretofore no successful
experiments have been reported on
the higher animals. Regeneration of
the higher nervous fibers has never
taken place in human beings.

By their method of work the ex-
perimenters were able to duplicate
the primitive ancestry of the individ-
ual, because during the prenatal state
mammals go through practically all
the primitive forms from that of the
fish upward.

"The successful men in college do not seem to be very happy. Most of them,
especially the athletes, are overworked." Prof. H. S. Canby, Yale.

the most important things for the student to learn is how to study. Without knowl-
edge of this his labor may be largely in vain.” Prof. G. F. Swain, M. I. T.

The Maroon’s search for a diver-
gence of opinion on the proposed raise
in quarterly tuition is no longer futile!
As an undegraduate, I am stung into
expressing a point of view that is sup-
posedly non-existent on the campus,
by reading yesterday’s maroon. I feel
that the authorities are entirely justi-
fied in raising the tutition, although it
raises a serious problem for me per-
sonally, as one of the many students
who work their way through. The
Chicago student never has paid, and
will not, even with the increased tui-
tion, pay more than 50 per cent of the
cost of his college education. Further-
more, How great a per cent of the
sum, varying from $900 to $1,500 and
more, which is spent by an undergra-
duate during the year, is the $45 extra,
which will mean so much to the Uni-
versity in increasing its facilities to

take care of the ever-increasing
mand for higher education?

Hard to Predict Winner

If the Maroons display anywhere
near the brand of basketball they dis-
played against the Badgers, the En-
gineers are doomed for a defeat, for
a real tight defense is poison to the
Hoosier style of dribble—long pass
attack. However doping basketball
results in the Big Ten this year is
worse than forecasting football re-
sults. Especially is this true since
the Maroons are an “in and out”
team. The outcome hinges on wheth-
er or not they are “in“ or “out.”

WHAT OF IT?

S. Mayer was the best I could do along
that line. I am hoping for better things
in the days soon to come, however, and
in anticipation of this time when, with
spring fully arrived, I shall be “the
happiest of men” I have patronized the
Hon. Doc Bratfish at the sign of the
“Razor and Clippers.” So, with all
these preparations made, I am awaiting
that there joyful harbinger of spring
that the boys talk about, and I warn
such imitation robins as Messrs. Mayer
and Bridges that I want nothing of
them.
