HOMECOMING LID

OFF TODAY

The Illinois boys will begin to hit
town today. This is a message ad-
dressed to them, for their own wel-
fare. I know the Illinois boys will
think that no such thing is possible,
coming from me, because of the maul-
ing I have recently subjected them
and the dear old Greatest State Uni-
versity to in this column. Such an
opinion, logical as it may seem to the
Illinois boys, is nevertheless in error.
For, in all my wanderings in the
realm of verbiage, I have really had
the good of the boys at heart. I have
merely wished to point out to them,
impartially—as an outsider looking
in calmly,—what an outsider sees in
them and in their school that allows
room for improvement. Somehow or
other, in all my moves, the Twin
Cities fellows have seen something
sinister, something that has alarmed
them. They have not taken my re-
marks as counsel, but as kicks in the
pants. And in all this they have beer,
wrong.

*	*	*	♦

But my advice to the incoming II-
lini for the day runs on somewhat
different lines than anything I have
dished out here yet. I understand
conditions in Champaign more truly
than they think possible. I know the
shadow that the long arm of Dean
Thomas Arkle Clark casts over
Champaign County. I know how col-
lege life, strange as this may seem, is
muffled by official tyranny at Illinois.
I know the fear in which “the au-
thorities” are held down there. I
know how the drug store clerks look
furtively over their shoulders, as if !
expecting the Dean to pop out of the
stacks of Tar Soap at any moment,
before they hand over the brown pa-
per parcel. I know all this, and I
have dread imaginings of what may
happen today and tomorrow up here
in free Chicago when the Illinois
boys, safe from the terrorism of
Thomas Arkle and his band of merry-
morose men, are left to do what they
will, without first thinking of the
Dean and the consequences. So, with
Wilfred Cross, I hold up a restrain-
ing finger and say, “Watch out. Easy
there, easy. Careful... .careful.”
Now who says I’m an Enemy of the
People?

* * * *

A secret society, not quite so se-
cret, is in process of formation in
these halls. It is built around the [
conception that his own fraternity I
need not necessarily represent the'
limit of fellowship that a man be
bounded by. And so, following out
logically this primary idea, the so-
ciety has organized itself around
fourteen men, representing nine frat-
ernities, as its charter members. It
will devote itself to the fostering of
closer bonds of fellowship in a group
that is already solidified through
common grounds of friendship and
interest. The idea represented in the
fact that the membership of the new
society is of many other different
fraternities is not an essentially
fresh one. At Arizona University, for
instance, there is a band called “The
Stray Greeks,” the body politic of
which is composed of members of va-
rious fraternities, initiated at other
chapters at Arizona. This same idea
schools, which do not happen to have
is the one about which such sub rosa
groups as Kappa Beta Phi and T. N.
E. have sprung up. It is not new,
but it’s a good idea.

The new organization is not a
Greek letter society, but calls itself
simply and soberly “The Tipplers”
has no significance particularly. It
has them “ties that bind” that the
other fraternities pride fnemselves in.
It will “tap” new members from time
to time, when they make their worth
apparent It will have its badge, that
will shortly hit campus. It will even
have its ritual and its robes. “Ale, ale,
the gang’s all here” will be its hymn.
But say, this is a secret society—and
here I am giving the secrets away.

MARKS ELECTED
TO DON UNIFORM
OF CADET MAJOR

Other Appointments Listed
By M. S. Dept.

Wallie Marks finds the step from
captain to major very easy, particu-
larly since he can retoin both titles at
the same time, a privilege afforded
only to a chosen few. In accepting his
recent appointment to rank of Acting
Cadet Major of the Military Science
department Marks enlists his services
in a new field under football battles
can be considered good preparation
for sham battles.

Appointments of cadet officers selec-
ted from the new enrollment in the
University’s Field Artillery unit of
R. O. T. C. have been announced as
follows: Cadet captains. Gerald N.
Bench, Edwin C. Mattick. Claude L.

Former N. U. Prexy
Preaches In Mandel

Lynn Harold Hough, former presi-
dent of Northwestern University will
conduct the Sunday chapel services
for the next two weeks in Leon Man-
del hall.

The services of Dr. Hough are in
demand in England where he lectured
during the summer. During the recent
trouble with the American Federation
of Labor in Detroit Dr. Hough spoke
in favor of church and labor organiza-
tions cooperating to settle such trou-
ble.

Dean Shailer Matthews states that
the Joseph Bond Chapel is open all
day to anyone.

BRETZ SPEAKS ON
“EARTH’S HISTORY”

“Geological Problems of the Earth's
History” is the general title as the
series of public lectures to be given by
Associate Professor J. Harlan Bretz
of the Geology department in Fuller-
ton Hall in the Art Institute. Pro-
fessor Bretz will discuss in the first
lecture of the series, which is being
given tonight at 6:45, “The Outline
of the Great Geological Processes of
the Present and the Past and the
Method of Reading the Earth’s His-
tory.”

His second lecture on “The Philos-
ophy of the Earth’s History” will be
given at a later date. These lectures
are being conducted under the au-
spices of the University College.

Open Settlement
Drive With Big

Ida Noyes Mixer

The Settlement Drive opens today.

A mixer in Ida Noyes at 4 has been
planned to mark the opening of this
year’s campaign. The music is to be
furnished by Ken Blake and his Trou-
badours, who will also play after the
Illinois game.

The team captains, who were an-
nounced yesterday, have begun their
work and will assemble their organ-
izations for their first official meet-
ing on Tuesday at 2:30. The per-
sonnel of these teams will be an-
nounced in The Daily Maroon early
next week.

Four thousand printed letters ask-
ing for support for the Settlement
have been prepared for distribution.
The Settlement night vaudeville is
being planned and it is expected that
it will rival last year’s entertainment,
which was directed by Donald Mc-
Ginnis and Alta Cundy.

This year’s campaign is to be or-
ganized according to much the same
plan as was employed successfully
last year. Those in charge of the drive
hope to pass the mark set in the cam-
paign last fall.

Harvard Reviewer
Speaks Cynically
Of Chicago Book

“To the fat lady in the side show
a steam piano may seem to be music,
and to the middle-western professor
his college may seem to be intellec-
tual.” declares Mark Howe, student
book reviewer of the Harvard Advo-
cate, in ‘an article on the latest Uni-
versity of Chicago book, Chimes, by
Robert Herrick.

From a Harvard viewpoint hoth
Mr. Herrick and Mr. Howe say that
the life of middle western universities
is petty, shallow and even tragic. In
conclusion the Harvard reviewer
writes, "The outcome of all this is
that the great novel of American edu-
cation has not yet been written.”

SIR FREDERICK WHITE
DELIVERS LECTURES
ON EASTERN WORLD

Sir Fredrick Whyte, M. A., L. L. D..
and first president of the Legislative
assembly of India will deliver four

joint auspices of the William Vaughn
Moody and Norman Wait Harris
Foundations.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
afternoons at four-thirty the Wait
lectures will be given in Harper As-
sembly Room with the general subject
“Contemporary India.” On Tuesday
at eight .in Leon Mandel assembly hall
the subject will be “Asia and the Wes-
tern World in the Twentieth Cen-
tury.”

The Moody lecture will offer a
general view*of Asiatic problems, and
the Harris lectures will give a more
detailed account of recent Indian gov-
ernment and politics.

Only Seniors Must
Pay For Pictures

Graduating Seniors are the only
ones who will have to pay for their
pictures in the Cap and Gown, accord-
ing to an announcement made yester-
day by the editors. Seniors will pay
two dollars for their pictures, but all
club, fraternity and feature pictures
will be free.

Record Crowd At
Tomorrow’s Game

If statistics mean anything, sev-
eral people want to see the Chi-
cago-Illinois game.

This fact manifested itself today
when the football tickets office an-
nounced that at least 50,000 persons
will witness the Illini fuss and at
least 10,000 persons will be disap-
pointed at the gate. Every possible
ticket was sold almost a week prior
to the closing date for applications,
Oct. 18, according to Lester F.
Blair, head of the tickets office.

Of the 50,000 rooters, 12,500 will
wear the Orange and Blue. Strag-
gling in today and tomorrow morn-
ing they will invade the campus and
take the trek to the south, east and
west stands of Stagg field, all of
which they will occupy.

Tomorrow will witness a record
crowd on the Maroon battlefield.

RICHBERG COMPOSES
“FLAG OF MAROON,”

NEW CHICAGO SONG

When the University band played
"Flag of Maroon" last Saturday, they
announced it as a revival of an old
song. Donald P. Richberg, composer
of the song, states that the song writ-
ten by him, made its initial appear-
ance last spring at the twenty-fifth an-
niversary of the class of 1901.

Mr. Richburg has written “For Chi-
cago Alma Mater” (1902), the first
marching song of the University, and
the “Song of the ‘C* ”, besides a doz-
en more or less famous football songs. j
He announces the "Flag of Maroon”
as the last of nis contributions.

LAY STONE OF NEW
SEMINARY NOV. 14

Plans have been made for the lay-
ing of the corner stone of the New
Chicago Theological Seminary for
November 14, at 4 in the afternoon.
This new addition to the University’s
buildings, located on the corner of
58th and University, will be known
as the Graham Taylor hall, in honor
of Graham Taylpr, a prominent lead-
er of political and social reforms. Mr.
Taylor was a former instructor of the
University and has taken an active Th-
terest in its growth for many years.

WELLS, HEARST AND COLLEGE

HG. WELLS, eminent English writer, recently attacked univer-
• sities and colleges in England and America, claiming that
they represented three or four year holidays in the lives of young
men.

Mr. Wells himself is not a college graduate and has achieved
a remarkable success in the field of literature. His Outline of
History” probably created more comment tha nany other book of
the year in which it appeared.

The Hearst papers taking up the cue for a good story support-
ed Mr. Wells editorially last night in the Chicago Evening Amer-
ican. With the English writer they point to Henry Ford, Ben Frank-
lin and Abraham Lincoln who startled the world without the aid of
a college education.

Neither Mr. Wells nor the Hearst papers are capable of taking
the attitude that these great men made their successes not because
they had no college training, but in spite of that handicap. Another
consideration which Mr. Wells and the Hearst papers thoughtfully
choose to overlook, is the fact that these great men (Abraham Lin-
coln for example) spent more time in hard study than most college
students spend today. And their study lacked a systematic organ-
ization and was necessarily based on a trial and error method of de-
velopment.

Today a young man, even a poor one, can earn his way through
school with but little effort. For four years he can systematically
train his mind under the guidance of the greatest thinkers in the
world. For four years he has the advantages of a cultural environ-
ment, of pleasant surroundings and intelligent companionship. Mr.
Wells and the Hearst papers would like to see young men deprived of
these opportunities.

Perhaps Mr. Wells plans to provide an education with his “Out-
line of History” and the Hearst papers with their magazine page
comic strips.

STILL PAYING TO ADVERTISE

ON the inside pages of this issue of the Daily Maroon there is a
great deal of ChifrcK advertising. We are glad to see that this
is true, because it shows that the church, that vital element in the
spiritual life of the people of the United States, has been put on a
business basis.

The aphorism “it pays to advertise” bas encroached on the
isolation of the church, and the old fashioned idea that its value is
universally appreciated and that consequent publicity is unnecessary.

We are in an era of efficiency and if the church is to survive
it must model its administration on modern business methods. We
think that when the church adapts new ways its workers will be bet-
ter able to appreciate and to more intelligently work on the prob-
lems within its range.

Once more we renew our faith in the church not only as a re-
ligious teacher, but as an organization for social service.

As a part of the Homecoming pro-
gram, the Intramural Department is
staging a new affair this afternoon.
They are conducting a touchball game
between two all-star teams composed
of the best players in the Inter-frat-
ernity and Club leagues. The game
will be held during the half-time per-
iod of the Yale-Harvard game on
Crisler Field.

Reasons For Selections

The men who compose the teams
were picked for their superb playing
in their Intramural games. Gist of
Phi Kappa Psi, Swede Gordon and
Libby of Psi Upsilon are the best
open field runners of this year. Knut-
eson of Phi Kappa Sigma is noted for
his long and accurate passes. Pollard
and Curtain are the star receivers of
both long and short passes. Arm-
strong is an extremely fast man and
probably will be used a great deal on
long end runs. Bartlett is a very
dangerous player on the defensive, es-
pecially in intercepting passes.

play in touchball. The Alpha Delt’s
won from the Phi Kap’s by 12 to 6;
Sigma Nu beat Chi Psi 18 to 0; Zeta
Beta Tau triumphed over Phi Gamma

Both the Alpha Delt’s and Phi
Kap’s showed class in their game,
short running passes finally winning
out for the Alpha Delts. The Sigma
Nu’s and Chi Psi’s were evenly match-
ed during the first half of their game.
Curtin was the star of the day catch-
ing long passes and making two
scores. Zeta Beta Tau and Phi Gam-
ma Delta were evenly matched. Their
game was featured by rough playing
and arguments.

Phi Sigma Delta and Phi Pi Phi
were unable to score in the first half.
In the second half the Phi Sig's made
two touchdowns. At one time they
were on their opponents one yard lute
and failed to put the all over.

During the first half of the Kappa
Sig and Alpha Tau Omega game the
two teams were evenly matched. In
the second period Hoke made a beau-
tiful run from the kick off and passed
to Harris for a score

1 Seniors Win, Sophs
Tie Frosh In Hockey

Improved playing of all four teams
marked yesterday’s hockey games on
the Midway. The senioi team beat

the sophomore women with a score of
2 to 1; and Juniors and Freshmen tied
2 to 2, in the second round of the
tournament series.

Helen Lamborn, at center .half
starred for the Sophs; while Madi Ba-
con, playing the same position for the
Seniors, was an outstanding player.
Senior defense was strong and the for-
ward line frequently outdistanced the
opposing backs, only to lose their ad-
vantage when the Sophomore center-
half broke up the passing attack with-
in the striking circle.

Freshman wings, Ann Port and Clair
Davis, view with each other for hon-
ors in their tilt with the Juniors. Miss
Sylvia Dow refereed this game and
Miss Marjorie Camp the Senior-Soph-
omore. Better team work and im-
proved passing attacks made these
games more interesting than the first
ones.

just 9 seconds slower than the winning
time in the Quadrangular meet.

Following is the order of the finish:
Jackson, Hitz, Hegovic, Ault, Burke.

Practice for the big game is very
intensive. So hard was the scrimmage
last Wednesday night that, in addition
to putting most of the freshmen om
with injuries, the varsity got rough
and almost put the “Old Man’’ out for
the rest of the season.

It all happened something like this:
Varsity and Frosh were having their
usual evening set to under the direc-
tions of Coach A. A. Stagg. As prac-
tice progressed the coach grew more
interested, and the team became more
intent on a ferocious slaughter of the
freshmen. Of a sudden a fumbled ball
ball bounced high from the piled up,
line of scrimmage aud rolled toward
the Maroon Mentor. Four flying fig-
ures leaped in mid air, one of them
recovering the pill, the other three
landing on Stagg. .

Now there are three stellar cripples
on the Maroon bench with A. A. Stagg
crowding Anderson and Rouse for
room. Stagg emerged from the scram-
ble with a bad ‘charley-horse.’

But ‘The Old Man’ has much to
console him. Pat Page met with the
same circumstances one football eve-
ing in 1918 and emrged not with a
‘charley-horse’, but with a broken leg!

DRILLS TEAM

ON OFFENSE

Maroons Out For First
Score Practice

Indicates

That Stagg will send the Maroon
eleven into the annual struggle with
Illinois with the intentions of whi-
ning rather than holding the score
down is evident from the practice
program the Maroons have been fol-
lowing this week. The Old Man has
been emphasizing offensive measures
all week, and he probably intends to
have his men follow the example of
the ’24 team which swept the over-
confident Illinois team off its feet be-
fore it knew that there was a game in
progress.

Both teams will hold their final
drills this afternoon on Stagg field
with Illinois going through its paces
first. Zuppke’s regular flankmen,
Capt. Kassel and D’Ambrosio, will
not start. Kassel, whose both knees
are in bad shape, might play for a
short while with the aid of braces.

The Maroons again spent the ma-
jor part of the time drilling on their
attack last night. With the regular
half-backs. Rouse, Anderson and Mc-
Kinney, looking on the second string
backs gained consistently through the
fresh on line smashes and off-tackle
drives.

We’re All New, Chicago

Sam and Dave Wolf are waiting for you with their
NEW PERSHING PALACE CAFE. They’ve com-
pletely remodeled it after the pattern of their Plantation
Cafe out in Los Angeles.

Chicago will flock to the NEW PERSHING PAL-
ACE on Friday nights—it’s College Nite, with real col-
legiate atmosphere. LOUIS PANICO and his orchestra
will provide the hottest kind of music—there’s enter-
tainment galore that we know you’ll like.

The food is excellent, the dance floor perfect—
and the cover charge is only fifty cents. Another in-
novation for you will be our Dancing Contest. A beau-
tiful Parisian Doll to the best couple on the floor.
