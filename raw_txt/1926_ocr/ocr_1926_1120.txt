LAST CHANCE FOR MAROONS

With the end of the football season
with us. “the melancholy days are
come, the saddest of the year.” That
is, they are come for dyed-in-the-wool
football fans, but some others of us,
who have followed Mr. Stagg’s hoys
in their forlorn quest, have no regrets
that the tumult and the shouting have
died for good and all. Aside from the
lack of satisfaction the Maroons have
got for themselves and their support-
ers, we see, in reviewing the situation
certain other things. Northwestern,
for instance, going into its last game
this afternoon, has just about the
best chance it ever had to burn bon-
fires or Sigma Chi houses in Evans-
ton on legitimate grounds. It looks
like the first championship for Thistle-
thwaite’s team since Potter. Van Du-
zen and Bloop wore the Purple back in
’96.

♦ ♦ ♦ ♦

Again, there is the possibility of Mr.
Stagg’s team not meeting Mr. This-
tlethwaite’s next fall. It all started
when somebody got hold of a letter
written by a loyal Northwestern old
grad to one of the Purple athletes
when he was yet a boy in high school,
saying that dear old N. U. had the
best School of Musical Appreciation
in the whole country and here was a
check, so why don't you come to
Evanston. It would not have been so
bad if it weren’t a form letter. Then
came the Tiny Lewis episode, which
didn’t help matters any. And so things
stand until the schedule making meet-
ing early next month.

* • * ♦

For the rest, Minnesota ought to
have a crushing team next year, with
the whole backfield and practically all
the line back again. Ohio ought to be
a great offensive combination in 1927,
and Mr. Stagg’s b oys (coming back
to them once more) won’t be so bad,
if present indications mean anything.
Illinois will have its Peters, its Lanum
and its Timm, who certainly will be
all right next season, with Bob Zup-
pke to talk about Greek myths and
the Nordic complex between plays.
All in all, it should be “the greatest
season yet." And now if you will,
to the business in hand....a certain
football team named Wisconsin.

Stan Rouse and Bert McKinney,
the two boys who have worked in Ma-
roon jerseys before and are wearers of
the “C,” will play the half positions
once more, with Stan trying to boot
the oval for ninety yard punts and
McKinney tirelessly running up and
down the field, he hopes, for touch-
downs. Hobart Neff is the last of
the “C" men to leave this year. Neff
has spent the year digging holes in
opposing lines at the guard position.

Of the five remaining lads, Laurie
Apitz. the long end of Wallie’s heavies,
is the most certian to carry away with
him a “C”. Laurie is the boy who has
gotten under the few complete Ma-
roon passes of the season and is re-
sponsible f or some stellar runs.

On the line, there is Greenebaum a
tough and heavy guard .who should be
able to stop everything that Wisconsin
sends through to his side. Greenbaum
would also like to wear a “C” during
the rest of his sojourn at the Uni-
versity.

Olwin, sub-center, and Cameron

valuable players to be lost by gradua-

Wally’s Last Game

By Victor Roterus

That this fall’s Maroon football
players would not be awarded the tra-
dit onal major “C” owing to their dis-
astrous season has been current talk
for the last two weeks and since the

Northwestern game has been accepted
as gospel truth.

Coach A. A. Stagg dispelled this
rumor for the most part when ap-
proached by the writer last night.
“Mostly idle talk,” Stagg said. “But I
did tell the boys before the North-
western game that the playing of some
of them did not warrant a letter.” Mr.
Stagg insisted, however, that he and
the team were primarily concerned
with the Badger game. Asked if to-
day’s game had any bearing on letter
awards he answered with an emphat-
ic “yes.”

So there’s the answer to the letter
question. Just how much bearing to-
day’s game will have on the situation
we must "wait and see.”

A CREDITABLE SEASON

DIG TEN football teams play their last Conference games today.

This is usually the time that we take stock of the season and
look back upon our record to see what we can see. Big Ten coaches
will meet next week to juggle schedules for 1927 and before long the
scribes will be selecting the teams that never play, the all-everything
bunch.

Chicago has had a creditable season. True we have not won a
conference game to date, and this afternoon is our last chance to lift
the stigma of not having won a conference game in 1926. Still Chi-
cago has had a creditable season.

The University of Chicago is the only school that has success-
fully supported the decision of conference schools to discourage long
football excursions. The team went to Pennsylvania virtually alone.
Other schools reported large excursions with two and three section
special trains carrying the rooters.

Chicago is the only school in the confeence that has stood by
the decision to admit free to games only 1 00 band musicians. For
this Chicago has been ridiculed and berated, but the “Old Man” has
kept the agreement he made with other schools, even where they
have failed to keep it.

Every man on the Maroon squad has a legitimate right to be play-
ing football for Chicago. No favors, no unreasonable inducements,
no stretching of scholarship grades to meet eligibility rules have al-
lowed men to play against other schools.

In spite of the fact that Chicago has steadily lost its games, the
Maroons have played to huge crowds all through the season. Purdue,
Ohio, Illinois, Northwestern and the Badger game today have all
drawn crowds above 40,000. Three of the games, Illinois, North-
western and Wisconsin played to full stadiums..

Pep sessions have been great successes for every game. Cheer-
ing at the games has steadily grown in volume. The second annual
Homecoming at the University imbibed the spirit raised for the Il-
linois game and went over big. And above all, the team has put
out all it had.

So to the nine men who play their last game here this afternoon
we say, “It was a creditable season.” To the student body, the fac-
ulty and the rest of the Big Ten, we say “It was a creditable season.”
Requiscat in pace.

STAGG TEAM IS
DESPERATE FOR

BADGER UPSET

(Continued from page 1)

and Iowa—two more or less weak ag-
gregations. Jimmy Phelan’s
outfit failed to make the one counter
against the Madison lads that they
shoved across the home lot. Minne-
sota outplayed Coach Little by more
than a 16-10 score, and Michigan, an
honest-to-God football team, had to
use an adding machine. Everybody
(now this hurts me worse than it
does you) cleaned up, more or less, on
our own sturdy chappies.

Captain Marks, Anderson (the triple
threat man who is back in the game
in perfect condition and doped to do
some heavy work), McKinney, and

Stan Rouse are going to do better at
executing Father Stagg’s plays than
they have done this season. This sea-
son is one of the worst we Chicagoans
have ever seen. Though the green line
has developed rapidly, the attack has
failed to come through. It may do
that today, wheAun lies the sneaker.

Coach Little’s Badgers got off to a
fair start this season but rebounded
with a terrific squeal when they hit
the conference. The line, while pow-
erful. falls far short of the stonewall
condition, and the offense, like Chi-
cago’s never did materialize. Rose
does the passing, and oh! how well.
He and Kresky, both sophomores, are
good for plenty ground, while Cap-
tain Harmon, Crofoot, and Barnum,
the latter a three-sport man, carry the
ball with results. A man named Welch I

seemed to be in the line-up against
Iowa. Harmon and Barnum do the
booting, and not much better than
McDonough or Rouse.

The game will be wide open, if this
and that mean anything. Wisconsin,
principally Rose, completed ten of
twelve attempts at passing against
Iowa. The Staggmen’s only score
was made on a pass, and pass, pass,
pass, has been the byword around
these parts all week. And the re-
juvenated formations that didn’t suc-
ceed against Northwestern, are anoth-
er reason for giving Chicago the break
on dope.

If Maroon oats victorious, hooray
—we didn’t think they could do it. If
Maroon droops in defeat—oh well, it
isn’t “the fact that you’re dead that
counts, but only how did you die?”

Two games, the outcome of which
will decide the conference title, occu-
py the spotlight in the final setting
of the Big Ten grid contests, today.
Michigan and Northwestern, both
have clean conference slates, and
their respective games with Minne-
sota and Iowa will determine who the
1926 title holder will be. In car-
both Michigan and Northwestern
are defeated there will then be a
triple tie between them and the win-
ner of the Ohio-Illinois game.

Michigan Meets Gophers

Michigan, with one of the most
versatile teams in its history, will
meet a much more improved Minne-
sota team than the ope which it de-
feated. earlier in the season. Coach
Spears, one of the Gophers has suc-
ceeded in rounding out -a powerful
team, well fortified in every depart-
ment of football. Michigan is not in
the best of condition becase of their
hard fought victory, last Saturday,
over Ohio state, and they must exert
their greatest efforts to withstand
the powerful smashes of Herb Joest-
ing, the Maroon and Gold ace. Nev-
ertheless Michigan is given the edge
by virtue of their season’s showing,
and a powerful team, built around
a galaxy of stars. Capt. Friedman.
Osterbaan, Molenda and Gilbert are
men who will keep the Northners on
their toes at all times.

Harvey Greenleaf, son of the
University band benefactor, is
evidently a chip off the old block
where music is concerned. He
played a saxophone in his High
School band and in the Conn In-

now playing in the University
band.

Mr. Greenleaf, president of the
Conn Intsrument Company in Eik-
hart, Indiana, hys in the past been
the University Band’s benefactor.
While Harvey’s older brother,
Leland, was in the University,
Mr. Greenleaf presented the band
with all of their new instruments.
With the new instruments, incl .id-
ing the world’s largest drum, to
aid them the band has grown to
it’s present size.

and besides these animate factors,
the ballroom will be decorated to
carry out college atmosphere to the
nth’ degree.

Perhaps the most significant fact
about the entire ball, though, is the
promise of President Mason and his
wife to be there. It all goes to show
that the University’s heads are bend-

Rice, Nebraskan, Sneers
At Loyal Greek Grads,
Calls Them Sophomoric

Automobile Worth Four of Five Bids, He Tells University of
Nebraska Student Body; Says One Rush
Brings Others

“Frateinities and sororities are
both stupid and worthless,” declared

John Rice of the
braska.

“Their so-called
people who never

University of Ne-

loyal alumni are
grow up—people

whose minds ceased broadening when
they were sophomores or before.”
Prof. Rice bases his judgments on
both experience and observation. He
is a fraternity man himself.

In his address before the Nebras-
ka student body he classified the
“bid-getting” possibilities of a Fresh-

man on the following scale; a big
automobile is good for at least frat-
ernity bids; other irrelevancies such
as clothing, family, looks also count
big on the scale. Psychology also
plays a role as pointed out by the
fact that if other fraternities show
indications of desiring the freshman
on the auction block his stock goes
up with leaps and bounds.

Prof. Rice bases his opposition to
initiation on the grounds of the un-
necessary humiliation brought upon
freshman. He classifies it as mere
child’s play.

REPENTANCE

He read my silly, scribbled rimes
And thought that he had read my
heart.

He loved me truly for one day.
And then said, “It is time to part.”

This is the plaintive tune I sing
Now, that he’s gone beyond recall—
“Why didn’t I wait till he’d called me
up

For a date to the Interfraternity Ball?”
—Marjorlaine

PROFESSOR John Rice of the
University of Nebraska says, “Frater-
nities are stupid and worthless. Men
are not rushed according to their in-
dividual calibres, buf according to ma-
terial possessions. For example, a
big automobile is good for at least five7
fraternity bids......” Well, well ....
and the Greek directory shows the
professor to be a full-fledged Deke. We
always wondered about the basis for
some of their rushing.

WE rise in indignation, though,
when the Professor goes on to say,
“Initiations are mere child's play.” De-
spite everything that the poets say, an
aching HEART is not the only thing
that a person can bitterly remember.

AS we have mentioned before, there
are eleven football players in Arty’s
Scott’s History 242 class. We earnest-
ly hope that the numerals on the back
of their jerseys do not represent their
grades for the quarter!

Talking of football—wonder if the
girl who sat next to us at the Florida
fracas has finally learned that Mr.
Stagg does not substitute two quarters
and a halback for every fullbck he
takes out of the game.

You ask that I remember you
And fear I may forget.	i

I cannot tell—nor understand
My friend, why you should set

Such value on remembering

That you should sigh.... and yet...

If so you must remembered be
A secret I’ll betray....

Dear GeoG:

Balloons at today's game are selling
at a quarter apiece instead of the cus-
tomary fifteen cent tax. After the first
touchdown when the sky is clouded
with these Maroon symbols of tri-
umph, will the people outside of Stagg
field be speaking ambiguously when
