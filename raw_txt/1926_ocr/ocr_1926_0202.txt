UNDERGRADS IN
ACTIVITIES GET
HIGH STANDINGS

Survey Shows That Students
In Activities Score

Scholastically

Undergraduates in activities at the
University scored in scholastic rating
as well as in their extra-curricular
pursuits during the autumn quarter.
A survey of the grades of students in
publications and dramatic produc-
tions, announced yesterday by Mr.
Frank H. O’Hara, director of under-
graduate activities, reveals that the
general average of grade points was
3.42, as against the 2 points neces-
sary for eligibility.

Members of the dramatic associa-
tion led with an average of 3.71
points, while the staffs of the publica-
tions made a 3.13 average. The high-
est rating was that of the joint dra-
matic board, with 3.9o points, prac-
tically a straight B. A number of
students in the* activity are can-
didates for Phi Beta Kappa.

Nearly all of these marks stand
well above the averages made by the
various fraternities and clubs, ac-
cording to markings released recent-
tly by the recorder.

The Circle, with six students, led
the publications with an average of
3.88 points, and Cap and Gown, with
24 students, had 3.41. The Daily
Maroon, with 28 staff members fol-
lowed with 2.93 and Phoenix was
last, with 11 students having an aver-
age of 2.58.

The dramatic association standing
was headed by the joint board of 5,
with 3.95 points, seconded closely by
the Mirror staff of 3, whose average
was 3.77. The cast of “Mr. Pim
Passes By,” consisting of 11 stu-
dents, had 3.65, while Gargoyles, with
five people, had but 3.60.

LAUNCH FRIENDSHIP
DRIVE WITH FROSH

CHAPEL COLLECTION

Student Friendship drive was!
launched yesterday in Freshman I
chapel with a contribution of eighty ।
dollars from the members of the j
class. The drive will last during this
week, and the sum to be raised has
been set as $1200. The purpose of
the drive is to assist the students of
Europe in reconstructing the educa-
tional system which was disorganized
during the World War.

Solicitors take contributions each
day after chapel, and men and wom-
en will also be stationed in the vari-
ous buildings on campus fo help col-
lect funds. Letters have been sent to
University graduates petitioning do-
nations.

“Students of Europe are not ask-
ing for or do they wish charity, all
they wish is a chance to help them-
selves since educational facilities in
Europe are decidedly inadequate. We
hope that class rivalry will serve to
bring more generous responses from
the other collections to be taken,
said Jennette Hayward, co-chairman
with Harry May of the drive.

FOREIGN STUDENTS

DISCUSS MISSIONS

All Christian students from other
countries have been invited to attend
a meeting on missions sponsored by
the Foreign Student Council of Y.
M. C. A. Monday at 8 at the home
of Mr. B. W. Dickson, 5644 Kim-
bark Ave-

The program will include two five
minute addresses by members of the
faculty on Christian Missions and
an open discussion on What Christian
Missions can do for the non-Christian
world of the Present.” Social games
and refreshments will follow the pro-
gram. „

Maybe there’ll be a Campus Apol-
lo in 1949, but there won’t be one
this year. After a week of heated
balloting, the contest, so far as actual
results in hitting upon the handsom-
est man on campus is concerned,
came to naught, and the ten bucks
that were to go with the distinction
found sanctuary in nobody’s pocket.
Instead, they go to the University
Nursery, where it is hoped they will
be used in.such a way that some day
there will. be a handsomest man to
teeter on the kerb outside Cobb hall
after classes. This year there won’t
be the man, but there will undoubted-
ly be the usual teetering.

JUNIORS PLAN

CLASS DINNER

Set Feb. 11 as Date; Arrange
for Informal Dancing

Juniors will assemble for their first
all-class function at the class dinner
which will be held Thursday, Feb.
11, at 6:45, in the refectory of Ida
Noyes hall. A committee composed
of Gifford Hitz, Esther Cook, Brad-
ley Davies, and George Wiemer is in
charge of the affair.

Walter Williamson will act as toast
master for the occasion. Vaudeville
acts have been planned to take place
between the courses, and Bill Hahn’s
orchestra will furnish the music for
the informal dancing which will fol-
low the dinner. Speakers will be an-
nounced later.

Dean, Ten Miles
Away, Keeps Tab
On Campus Doings

Although he has been ten miles
away from the campus for the past
month, Dean Wilkins has kept in
close touch with the University and
all of its activities through his regu-
lar perusal of The Daily Maroon.

This fact indicates not only that
the dean has an active interest in
campus affairs, but that he will prob-
ably return to his University duties
in the near future. Miss Gordon, his
secretary substantiates the latter
probability with the statement that
he will almost unquestionably take
over his regular class in the study
of Dante before the end of the
quarter.

Another probability indicated by
his secretarial staff and hospital re-
ports is that Dean Wilkins will not
undertake his work as Dean of the
Colleges before next quarter at the
earliest. Prof. Chauncey S. Boucher,
Associate Dean of the Colleges, will
continue to fill the position.

That Mr. Wilkins is on the road to
recovery is revealed by the daily re-
ports of the Presbyterian hospital,
shewing a steady improvement in the
patient’s condition.

The Verdict

Monday, 11 p. m.

We have been asked to pick I
from the three tied contestant* . .
or any other men at the University
. . . the most handsome man. Af- |
ter studying the question exhaus-
tively, we are forced to announce
that there are (we regret to re-
port) no handsome men at the
University.

We are extremely sorry that we
must act as we do. We hope that
our decision can be concealed and
suppressed, lest women be discour-
aged from entering your Univer- I
sity. Be that as it may, we were
asked to arrive at an honest de-
cision, and this (so help us God!)
we have done.

Thirty-Six New
Men Now Wear

Pledge Buttons

With the close of the informal
rushing period of the winter quarter,
undergraduate fraternities announce
the pledging of men.

While there is no distinct period
for pledging at this time of the year,
as there is at the beginning of the
Autumn quarter, all winter quarter
pledging is practically concluded by
the end of January. The Greek so-
cieties will continue to “button" men
throughout the year, but the great
part of the work is over.

Lambda Chi Alpha lead the pledg-
ing with six men. Four new TKE
pledge pins are sported, while Phi Pi
Phi has added a like number.

Considering the fact that only
fifty-seven freshman men and women
entered school at the first of the year,
the number of neophytes j§ remark-
able. An overwhelming majority of
the future Greeks come from the
recently registered group, only a few
being upper-classemen.

Following is an official list of the
secret societies and the men whom
they have pledged.

Alpha Delta Phi—Patrick Kelly,
Chicago. Alpha Tau Omega—
Thomas H. Corbett and Charles Bur-
ris, of Chicago. Beta Theta Pi—
Ralph Stitt and James Britton of
Chicago. Chi Psi—Linn Garibaldi,

FLOOK RESIGNS JOB;

ACCEPTS NEW ' ONE

Mr. Lyman R. Flook has resigned
his position as superintendent of
buildings and grounds at the Univer-
sity, it was announced yesterday. In
the future he will devote his entire
time to supervising the new construc-
tion work that is now in progress.

H. F. Greanbam, who has been an
assistant to Mr. Flook has been ap-
pointed to fill the vacancy.

tiles, from fifteen to fifty million years
old, near Archangel, Russia, have led
a Russian scientist to believe these‘an-
imals are related to similar ap.wQ^S
discovered in Texas, it became known

at the University yesterday. A" Tetter
from Peter P. Sushkin, of the

Leninograd academy of sciences to
Prof. A. S. Romer, University pale-
ontologist, has started new investiga-
tions in the field.

Interest in the research ^centers
around th skeleton of a peculiar an-

what is now the United States. The
specimen was uncovered a few years

Selden Commends
University Morals

In Magaizne Story

had been counted in on the standings,
it was found that a triple tie between
three of the all-week leaders existed.
Tables and chairs were piled against
the office door which held back the
surging collegians, and when this bar-
ricade had been effected a freshman
was ordered to poke his head out of
a window and announce the result of
the contest. A roar of rage came up
from the throng, but the door held
firm and violence to the persons of
the committeemen was avoided.

How was the thing to be settled?
Finally it was decided that the affair
be handed over to a jury composed
of experts on the subject of mascu-
line pulchritude, to be decided on the
merits (that is, the faces), of the
three tying contestants. Bull Mon- j
tana, Lon Chaney and Louie Wolheim
were named to constitute the per-
sonnel of this body.

Saturday the committee of experts
gathered in an obscure basement on
the south side to consider the tie.
There the Messrs. Montana, Chaney
and Wolheim grappled with the prob-
lem all through the day. At 11
o’clock that evening they adjourned
having arrived at no settlement.
They reassembled at 9 the next morn-
ing, and after an all-day session
(lasting, indeed, far into Monday
morning) they arrived at certain con-
clusions, which they drew up in the

Conditions at the University of
Chicago are very different from
those at Harvard and Princeton, ac-
cording to a statement made by
Charles A. Selden in an article called
“Fashions in College Morals” pub-
lished in the February issue of the
Ladies Home Journal. The chief rea
son for this difference lies in the
fact that there is no group of stu-
dents with too much money at their
disposal, and also in that the institu-
tion is coeducational. After a very
careful study of the conditions at a
number of representative colleges
Mr. Selden reports that there is less
drinking, less gambling, and less dis-
honesty among the stuaencs than is
found at either Harvard or Prince-
ton.

Fraternities lead the fashions in
student morals according to Mr. Sel-
den. They include forty per cent of
the enrolled undergraduates. The
greater number of non-fraternity
men do not live at the University nor
actively participate in college activ-
ities. The most serious problem con-
fronting the fraternities is the one of
drink. The way this problem has
been dealt with is well illustrated
by the fact that at the Washington
Prom in 1924 there was only one case
of a person carrying liquor on his
person and that person was an alum-
nus.

Gambling is trivial, due largely to
the effective student sentiment built
up by Prof. A. A. Stagg. Loyalty to
the teams does not necessarily re-
quire betting on games, as Mr. Stagg
has pointed out to the student body.
The honor commission made up of
students has succeeded in lessening
the amount of cheating and dishon-
esty to a minimum. All this goes to
prove that the situation in modern
educational institutions is not as bad
generally, or in the particular in-
stance of the University of Chicago,
as is commonly made out.

Russian Scientist Uncovers Fossil

Related to Ancient Texan Reptile

Recent discoveries of ancient rep-

ago by Paul Miller, of the University'
Walker museum, and brought to the
University from Texas for study and
classification. It was dug out of the
Permian beds of that state, its loca-
tion giving it an almost inestimable
age.

Dr- Sushkin believes that this spe-
cies is similar to those discovered in
northern Russia and that it is an ad-
vanced amphibian. Study of the
specimen may add a new chapter to'
the volume of evidence already collec-
ted to show the relationship between
ancient American reptiles and those
of Europe and South Africa. Much
of the material collected has been too
fragmentary for accurate description,
it is said.

CIRCLE, PHOENIX
JOIN STAFFS IN
NEW MAGAZINE

To Become “Vanity Fair” of
the Collegiate World

By New Plan

By Walter G. Williamson

Setting a precedent for college
publications the Phoenix has consoli-
dated with the Circle, university lit-
erature magazine, in forming the
“Vanity Fair” of the collegiate
world. The editorial boards of the
two magazines win co-operate under
the direction of Fred Handschy, edi-
tor of the Phoenix.

Beginning with the February edi-
tion the humor magazine will contain
articles pertinent, not only to the in-
congruity of life, but to the literary
efforts of famous men and women as
well as undergraduates.

The editorial board of the Circle
which is to be incorporated with the
Phoenix is headed by Betty LeMay.
Austin McCarty, Henry Kitchell
Webster Jr., Daniel Rich and Joseph
White, co editors will contribute orig-
inal material as well as that secured
from personalities, unique in their
several fields.

A common interest in supporting
one super-magazine is cited as the
reason for the consolidation of the
two magazines. The new magazine
as conceived by the editors will con-
tain material which will interest ev-
ery undergraduate. It will be the
outlet for student expression.

The Circle was ready to go to press
when the series of conferences was—•
arranged. Finance played no part in
the merger according to Miss Le-
May.

Handschy when questioned said:
“In such a university as ours, a uni-
versity that does not profess a rah-
rah spirit, the existence of two mag-
azines of such widely divirsifjed
types, would lead to the classification
of one as ‘low-brow’ and the other as
‘high-brow’.” Miss LeMay intimated
that she thought the Phoenix an ideal
outlet for literary material.

CONTRAST LOCAL AND
FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL

PLANS IN DISCUSSION

Education in the United States will
be contrasted with that in foreign
countries at an open meeting of Fed-
eration tonight from 7 to 8 in the
library of Ida Noyes hall. The dis-
cussion will be preceded by a group
of talks by foreign women on their ,
personal experiences as students in
other countries. The speakers are
Heloisa Marinho, Hilda Joseph, Ra-
ina G. Ivan off, Elena Landatzuri, and
Violet Wong.

Federation sponsors will act as
hostesses at a dinner preceding the .
meeting at 6 in the cafeteria. All
foreign women who are interested in
the subject, and who are planning to
attend the meeting are cordially in-
vited to the dinner as well, said Betty
LeMay, publicity chairman of the or-
ganization.

MIRROR REHEARSALS
TO BEGIN TOMORROW

Rehearsal for the First Annual
Mirror will be held tomorrow at 3:30
in the theater of Ida Noyes hall. The
names of the cast and chorus will be
announced tomorrow and it is impera-
tive that all the women chosen at-
tend the rehearsal.

Instrument tryouts will be held to-
day at 12 in Cobb 110. All women
who are able to play any instrument
whatever are urged to attend this
tryout. Final voice tryouts will be
held tomorrow at 3:30 in the theater
of Ida Noyes hall.

HIT THE WALK

A S the snow begins to melt in the quadrangle, students are begin-
^ ^ ning to cross the campus on the grass. When late to class the
line of least resistance is the straight one. Hence well-developed
“Calf-paths” may now be seen on many of the campus greens.

The Undergraduate council conducted a “hit-the-walk” cam-
paign last Spring for the erring students. It was successful because
the undergraduate body realized the advantages of having a beau-
tiful campus unadorned with barren oases.

As the fiscal Spring approaches the practise of hitting the walk
becomes necessary. Although the seed has not yet been planted the
existing grass must not be destroyed. It provides the protection for
the seed when it has been sown. It is better to be late to class once
or twice than to ruin the campus which affords pleasure not only
to you but to everyone.

at Bartlett Gym
Tonight

Pat Page and his fast stepping
Butler five, make their annual pil-
grimage to his Alma Mater when the
Hoosiers meet the Maroons tonight at
Bartlett Gym. The Indianapolis quint
has repeatedly defeated Maroon
teams in the past but this time it
looks as if Chicago will obtain re-1
venge. Page has an exceptionally ver-
satile outfit that is about the best
in Indiana, which is quite a broad
statement. Last year it won the na-
tional amateur title.

Maroons Topple Leader*

No doubt Norgren’s protege’s will |
have a tough time with the invaders ’
but it cannot be much tougher than

was the Ohio State game. All the
cunning of Cookie Cunningham and
his mates could not daunt the fight-
ing Maroon defense. After trailing
throughout the ferociously contested
fray, the Maroons finally got going
and with Chuck Hoerger looping
three sensational baskets, pulled out
a 21 to 20 win.

Hoerger Shine*

Hoerger displayed the best eyes of
the home team while Alyea and Sac-
kett shone on the floor. Little John-
ny Dempsey kept the Buckeyes in the
running untij the final whistle with
his long shots. Cunningham failed to
go on a scoring orgy due to the Ma-
roon stellar guarding. On Saturday
the same teams meet again, this time
at Columbus. By their defeat the
Buckeyes were dropped from first
place giving Wisconsin an undisputed
hold on the leadership.

Award Green Shirts
to Four in Fencing

Green shirts have been awarded to
four men for their work in Freshman
fencing and the announcement has
been made that the men chosen will
compose the Freshman team. Charles
Falk has been chosen captain by the
foil men who include Luis Campos,
Callard Livingston, and J. E. A. Hop-
kins. An alternate will also be chos-
en. These men have shown proficien-
cy in the use of the weapon and next
season should furnish some really
good material.

A new fencing class for men is be-
ing begun today in Bartlett fencing
room to continue through the grades.
It grants P. C. credit and any mem-
bers of other P. C. classes who wish
to transfer to it may do so by apply-
ing at Dr. Reed’s office. The class is
scheduled to meet at 4 :00 p. m.

The instructor will be Gene Bea-
sant This is the first time since 1911
that there has been a pai* frisfructor
in fencing, indicating interest in the
sport. This spring there will be fenc-
ing with foils, sabres and duelling
swords in the Intra-mural tourna-
ment.

Divinity, Zeniths,
Macs Win Games

Of the four-non-fraternity
games scheduled for last night,
three were played off and one was
forfeited. The Packers Club for-
feited to the Chicago Theological
Seminary. The other three con-

ing, the Macs defeated the Ro-
mans, 28 to 21. This was prob-
ably the best game of the evening
as to speed and fast play, although
the Zenith- Apache tilt was the
one with the heart-throbs. Good-
man played his usual game for the
winners.

Divinity School won from Blahe
hall, 15-11 in a close tilt, and the
Zeniths defeated the Apaches
26-23 in an overtime period. Pale-
ich starred for the winners with
four buckets and two foul throws.



we have worried along hereabouts
without student managers for our
athletic teams, and the loss of morale,
no less great than the blow to prest-
ige, which the lack of such individuals
means to the university is, I believe,
tremendous. It is time for this situ-
ation to' be remedied.

The Student Manager is a law un-
to himself. He is himself, and suf-
fice it to say that there’s nothing else
in the wide world like him. He is al-
ways the most collegiate of the col-
legians. He sports a coon; he smokes
the King’s Size; probably he even
wears galoshes (and, of course, gal-
luses). He is the fellow who buys
his ties in Champaign at Gelvin’s, in
Madison at Jack P. Flanagan’s (or
something like that — I rather for-
get), and in New Haven at Gold-
stein’s. He wears the latest Brooks
Brothers models; his pedal extreme-
ities are encased in Frank Brothers
shoes- He is, in short, that kind of a
guy.

It is the duty of the Student Man-
ager to (a) look the part; (b) never
forget, his station in life; (c) be the
first after Davy Windsor to wear
pearl-gray bows, sleeve garters, or
whatever else is the thing; (d) to re-
flect honor and glory on the dear old
school by making people thing he is
representative of the whole student
body; and (e) occasionally (and if
it does not interfere with his other
functions), to sit on the bench at
basketball games, etc.

I do not know how Chicago has ever
got along through all these long years
without the Student Manager. I am
sure that it is at least partly because
there is not one around the Midway
that the old school has never been ex-
actly synonymous with the adjective

“collegiate,” and why critics have had
such latitude in complaining of “lack
of college spirit.” But, on further
consideration,’ I am seized with the
idea that perhaps the old school has-
n’t ever had such an institution be-
cause there isn’t any such animal
around

LARGEST TRACK
SQUAD IN YEARS

DEFEATS INDIANA

Cusack Takes Two Firsts
In Initial Conference
Trackmeet

lett last Friday evening, which the
Maroon clad cohorts won from In-
diana by the overwhelming score of
58-28. This is the largest track squad
which the University has ever pro-
duced, over forty being eligible at
present and an addition of ten men
expected in the near future.

Cusack High Point Man

Cusack and Anton Berg were high
point winners for their respective
teams, Jimmie taking firsts in both
the mile and the half mile, and Berg
winning the high jump and the pole
vault. Fried jumped 6’ 5” but touch-
ed the bar as he went over.

The half mile was a Maroon event
altogether, the local track hopes scor-
ing a slam, taking all three places,
with Cusack taking first, Kelso a close
second and Boynton, a sophomore,
third. Metzenberg took a second in
the hurdles, following L. E. Smith.

Relay Squad Wins

The relay team took an easy win
with Smith, Weddell, Armstrong Les-
Beal and Lowry running. Hobscheid
won the shotput with a throw of al-
most fifty feet. The team showed it-
self to be very well balanced, but
lacking in individual stars.

Indiana Five Wins
From Hawks, 30*20

Bloomington, Ind., Feb. 1, (Spe-
cial to The Daily Maroon)

Indiana defeated Iowa, 30 to 20
on its home floor tonight before
an extra large and uproarious
gathering of spectators.

This win pushes the Hoosiers up
in the conference standings from
fifth to a tie for second place, with
four wins, and two defeats. It
trails Wisconsin, the leader by a
few points and is in a knot with
Michigan at .667 percent. The
Hawks remain in eighth place.

Alpha Tau Omega, Phi Gamma Delta
and Phi Kappa Sigma, have complete
license to entertain visions of the all-
important and shiny container mak-
ing attractive some otherwise obscure

he content with speculation and the
business of turning back their weaker
brothers. Murphy and Anderson have
a tendency to star for the A. T. O.

two defeats.

Phi Kappa Sigma made its leader-
ship of the Beta league secure by giv-
ing the Chi Psi’s, runners-up, their
first setback. The Phi Kaps have
three victories to their credit, being
unmarred by defeat. Included in their
triumphs is the Phi Kappa Psi group

Alumni Meet Frosh
In Basket Contest

After the varsity game tonight
with Butler, a group of alumni will
meet the first freshman basketball
team in a practice scuffle. Six of the
alumni, Dixon, Crisler, Tony Wilson,
Molander and others will participate
in the play.

The frosh first squad is purported
to be one of the best in many yearSt
with Kaplan, Ghist and many other
high school luminaries on its list, and
the tilt should be an interesting one
to the spectators who stay after the
regular game to watch it. It will be-

arrives before Thursday and Friday,
February 4th and 5th respectively,
the carnival is sure to be a success.
Right now the only thing lacking is
a field of nice ice and that will soon
be on hand, according to the U. S.
Weather Bureau.

the meet with the mixed men’s races

FROM THE PRESIDENT

OF THE NURSERY BOARD

Dear Editor:

As a reader of The Daily Ma- j

interest the search of the quad-

is with regret that I learn no per- |

SORRY, FRED

THIS MAN, Fred Hobscheid, was expected to win the $10 prize in The Daily Maroon’s search
for a handsome man. Instead, neither Fred nor anybody else won the money. The Nursery got
it by default. As a recognition of those qualities which almost won the contest for Hobscheid, we
print his picture, with the $10 check that he did not win.

ards of pertection are iw high.
But since your failure results in
this generous gift to the Univer-
sity Nursery, I can only be grate-
ful and assure you that starting
as we do, at the Nursery, with
two-year-olds, and aiming at
physical perfection, we can con-
fidently expect that by 1945 the
Nursery will contribute to the
campus an Apollo who will satis-

fy even the Maroon s lofty stand-
ards of grace and beauty.

Cordially,

banging away at the scenery for the :
Playfest. In the lobby they are busy
making change for tickets and palm-
ing off the Z seats on little guys. In
one corner of the place Joe Barron
and Jerry Quinn are jigging about
for their specialty dance. And all
over the theatre people lay crumpled
up in the seats, staring at typewritten
pages, and mutter desperately to
themselves. (Not an Adv.)
