I have noticed a curious change of
attitude lately in the boys who watch
the eleven Maroon defenders of the
faith who shed their life’s blood so no-
bly every Saturday afternoon. In the
old days, the so-called customers who
occupied the hard seats in Mr. Stagg’s
concrete stand were prone to put in
the afternoon deriding the efforts of
the Midway athletes. They would,
week in and week out,* sit around, with
their hats cocked back on their heads,
chewed cigar butts protruding from
their mouths, and a mildly contemptu-
ous, if half-amiable, look on their pans
for the efforts of Mr. Stagg's boys.
This was in the old days, as I say,—
the days in which it was more or less
of a habit for Chicago to win their
contests of skill and strength through
the autumn season.

Not only were the cash customers
—the outsiders—antagonistic to the
Maroons, but even the students on oc-
casion were accustomed to belittle the
earnest (and oftentimes winning) work
of the eleven. Why there was such an
attitude among the boys in the stands
is difficult to say. But, at any rate, it
was there. Do what the team would,
it could not gain the support of popu-
lar favor. Win as it might (and it
won with regularity), there was still
this antagonism, approaching in some

instances almost to scorn, among
Saturday afternoon followers for
efforts of Mr. Stagg’s boys.

Even at the start of the current sea-
son, the state of affairs gave every in-
dication of going on as usual. When
the team showed that it was not up to
the usual standard of the Maroon de
fenders of the faith, however, things
changed. When it was seen that even
>uch teams as Florida and Maryland
could give the boys a respectable run,
there was a noticeable veer in the trend
of public opinion. The team began to
have support—support of a sort it was
hardly accustomed to. The cigar-chew-
ers in the stands began to wish the
players well. The student body indi-
cated that, win or lose, it would accept
what might come without grumbling.
When, after the team was butchered

Fraternity decorations, displaying
to the world the warm welcome await-
ing alumni returning from the far cor-
ners of the e |*th for the annual Home-
coming, must be up by Thursday eve-
ning of this week, according to an ul-
timatum issued yesterday by Sidney
Collins, newly appointed head of the
decorations committee.

Included on the committee with
Collins to assist him in promoting a
spirit of competition among the vari-
ous fraternities are Janies Black,
Charles Warner and bred Von Am-
mon.

Set Deadline Early

The deadline was set rather early
in the week in order that the fraternity
men will have time on their hands to
properly welcome the returning grads.
Some of the annual migrators will
naturally arrive on campus Friday, due
to the long distances that they must
travel. According to Collins, it is im-
perative that they do not find the cam-
pus in the midst of the bustle attend-
ing the installations of “Welcome”
signs.

^Vice-President Ferederick C. Wood-
ward, Mr. Frank Hurburt O’Hara and
Mrs. Robert V. Merrill will act in the
capacity of judges to award the shield
donated by the alumni association to
the best decorated house. The judges
will visit all of the Greek lodges on
Friday afternoon and base their judg-
ment on attractive appearance and
originality of idea. This year is the
first time that a prize has been award- •
ed to the most artistic group of frat-
ernity men on this occasion, although
decorations at this time have been rec-
ommended. «

Interfraiernity delegates will gather
informally at the Delta Sigma Phi
house this evening to discuss plans re

A practice debate will be held to-
morrow afternoon at 3:30 in Cobb

November 23. will be selected. “Re-1

Appointment of Marcus W. Jerne-
gan, professor of American history at
the University, as director of a survey
“to determine why doctors of philos-
ophy are not more productive of schol -
arly work” is announced here by Prof.
Dana C. Munro of Princeton, presi-
dent of the American Historical As-
sociation.

It is said that too many Ph. D.’s
become teachers and too few develop
as scholars. Since small colleges in-
sist upon advanced degrees for mem-
bers of their teaching staffs, courses
planned to meet the requirements of
the scholar are swamped with stu-
dents intending to become teacher!.

The confusion resulting will lead to
the establishment of separate types of
training, according to Prof. Munro. It
is the purpose of the Association, Prof.
Munro stated, to appoint a committee
to study further the conditions dis-
closed by Prof. Jernegan’s survey.

Disprove Failure
Of First Born

Will you make a success of life or
are you doomed to final failure be-
cause you are, or are not, the first
born of your family?

Judge for yourself. Mr. Henry
Shultz, statistician of the University,
quoting Carl Pearson’s book “On the
Handicapping of the First Born,” says
the oldest member is handicapped by
both physical and mental characteris-
tics, such as petulance, irritability and
liability to insanity.

Instances among the notables on I
campus which may prove or disprove I
these views are Wally Marks football
hero, the youngest of the family; Bet-

council, who is the oldest; Allen Mil-

Beta Kappd and John Meyer, president
of the senior class who both played

Date For Chicago
Night Celebration
Changed to Nov. 12

I t! ink, less di..cult to put one’s fin-
I think, less difficult to put one’s fin-
the cause. I ascribe it to the fact that
( hicago is no longer the favorite in
its contests—that, indeed, it goes into
them definitely the underdog. The
Maroons now occupy the same position
in the eyes of local sport followers
that Northwestern for years has. Sea-
son after season, the Purple would
take the field to go down to certain
defeat—and yet, to a great extent, the
mob was with them. And so now
with the Maroons. The underdog, they
have the crowd behind them. There is,
in the eyes of the folk on the mar-
ketplace, something more gallant in
fighting and losing than there is in
sluggishly grinding along to deaden-
in strings of victories.

It is rather nice to see the cigar-
chewers of sardonic eye of the old
days standing up with hands clenched
and howling for the boys to put out
their best. Even, in fact, nicer in some
ways than when the boys used to win
regularly—indifferently as such vic-
tories might be taken by the folk in
the stands sitting with their hands fold-
ed apathetically over their paunches.

First Snow Falls;

Freezing, Prediction

Old Man Winter paid his first for-
mal call of the season when one tenth
of an inch of snow fell on campus yes-
terday afternoon.

The weather forecast for today
and Wednesday follows. Generally fair
tonight and Wednesday, colder tonight
with freezing temperature; fresh to
moderately strong northwest winds
tonight, diminishing by Wednesday.

The weather bureau states that snow
at this time of year is nothing unusual;
in fact it is to be expected.

Members of the faculty of the Uni-
versity who have attained distinction
and world-wide fame will be discussed
under the topic of “Campus Personal-
ities” at the Federation meeting to-
night from 7 to 8 in the library of
Ida Noyes hall. The rating of the va-
rious departments of the University
will also come into the discussion. It
is learned from data acquired from an
authority of Oxford University tha'
according to the consensus of opinion
the University has more departments
that rank first in specialized study than
any other college in the United States.

Details will be told concerning the
lives and works of famous members
of the faculty who are practically un-
known to the students but who are
known to the world. Besides side-
lights on faculty personalities, there
will be brought into the discussion
the various opportunities that are open

W. A. A. Chicago Night has been
postponed until Friday, Nov. 12, the
evening before the Northwestern game,
because of a conflicting dinner in the
Hutchinson Commons on the same
evening. The annual dinner will be
held at 5:30 in the main gymnasium of
Ida Noyes hall.

The women will attend the big pep
session en masse after a program of
singing, cheering, and addresses by
prominent speakers which has been ar-
ranged by Virginia Gartside. Tickets
are on sale for one dollar and may be
secured from W. A. A. members. All

Georgiana Whitcomb
Leads Arden Ball

Georgiana Whitcomb, a freshman
at the University last year and a
pledge to Esoteric, will be one of the
social leaders at the Arden Shore Mili-
tary Ball. The ball is to be given in
the Hotel Sherman November 26, the
eve of the Army-Navy football game.
She is one of the committee meet-
ing at the Army-Navy Club next
Monday afternoon to plan the ball. It

to any student for acquaintance with I is expected that Miss Whitcomb will

Opening Friday with a dance at Ida
Noyes hall, the annual Settlement
drive of the University will continue
through a thirty day program which
will end Saturday, Dec. 4, the night
designated as “Settlement Night.”
^ivc thousand dollars has been set
as the goal in the drive by Parker
Hall, who is co-chairman with Esther
Cook of the huge charity drive. This
sum represents an increase of $400
over last year’s net proceeds.

Appoint Chairmen

The two general chairmen have ap-
pointed the following committees to
assist them in putting the drive
across: vaudeville, Clyde Keutzer and
Margaret Carr; booths, John Meyer
and Barbara Cooke; donations, Chas.
Cowan and Betsy Farwell; decora-
tions, John Gerhart and Isabel Bates;
tag day, John McDonough and Vir-
ginia Gartside; tea dances, Jack Stam-
baugh and Catherine Fitzgerald; mu-
sic, James Webster and Allis Gra-
ham; program, William Heitman and
Charles Warner; publicity, Deemer
Lee; finance, Holmes Boynton and
Frances Kendall. Twenty team cap-
tains, ten men and ten women, work-
ing with 200 persons, will be announc-
ed later this week, Hall states.

Plan Tea Dances

Friday’s dances from 4 to 6, at Ida
Noyes is the first of a series of three
tea dances planned as a part of the
months’ program. Tag day falls on
November 22. Last year, $480 was
earned by this means. Selling balloons
at football games netted $80 last year
and Hall hopes to raise the amount
this year by selling them at the Wis-
consin game.

Settlement Night includes sixteen

acts of

shifts of

vaudeville,

staged in two

ight acts each, a dance in

Hutchinson Commons, and the booths
in the Mandel hall corridor. Mandel
hall, the Reynolds club, the Quad-
rangle and the Commons will all be
thrown open to close the thirty day
i drive with a grand program of enter-
' tainment and dancing.

Adults and children of the West side
are given recreation in the form of
reading, playing, class work, and out-
ings by the Settlement House which
depends in part for its support upon
the annual drive conducted at the Uni-
versity for its benefits.

“Enter the Hero,” by Theresa Hei
burn, is the title of the annual Fresh-
man play which will be presented to-

KIDDIES APPEAL FOR

FAIRY STORY BOOKS

From the University Settlement
comes the cry for story books for kid
dies five to fourteen years old. Th'
children feel the lack of entertainin'
books in their library and sepd tber
appeal to the University that befriends
them. Mark Twain and Fairy Tales
are favorites with these boys and girl -
They want the fairy stories to color
their lives and Mark Twain to mak-'
them laugh. So they ask th” Unh-e-
sity to help cheer their winter days
by sending these books.

TODAY IS ELECTION DAY

TODAY is election day. But how little that fact means to this
community, a community inhabited by those who think of them-
selves as educated, social beings!	•

Comments are current, not only among students, but also
among professors that it does not help to vote, since politicians will
always be crooked,and that certain factions are elected before the
elections take place. Have these people stopped to think that only
by massing the vote and the influence of the educated people will
these evils be corrected, and trustworthy office holders be selected?

ON MR. FRANK SWINNERTON

AN ENGLISH NOVELIST on an American tour is neither a noveity
nor an inspiration. Rarely, it seems, does he cross the bound-
ing main to occupy our platforms and our time because he has any-
thing important to say. What he considers worth giving to the
world he puts into his books.

But lecturing in the United States is profitable and wholly flat-
tering. It is one of America’s best known rituals to pay homage
to illustrious Europeans who are touring the provinces. And in all
fairness one must admit that sometimes these visitors are amusing.

Mr. Fraiik Swinnerton, author of Nocturne, Yeung Felix,
Coquette and numerous other novels, who read a speech at Mandel
hall last Thursday evening was just that. He spent his alloted two
hours retailing intimate incidents in the daily lives of the triumvirate
of contemporary English letters, Wells, Bennett and Shaw. Some I
of these anecdotes were amusing and some had a bit of charm in
their telling, but the main attraction was Mr. Swinnerton himself.

It was that we might be able to see a real live English author
with our own eyes, that we might hear about other authors from
the very lips of their friend and associate, that we might be improved I
with the knowledge o' ail manner of trivial things about those en- ‘
gaged in the task of turning out books, that Mr. Swinnerton made
his perilous voyage across the Atlantic.

We wish to thank Mr. Swinnerton for the delightful way he
described Mr. Well’s breakfast. But personally, we have a distinct
preference learning about authors from their books.

TOO MANY FOOTBALL TEAMS

WHEN two football teams get in each other’s way there’s a terrible I
mess. But when two football teams and a 120 piece band1
get in each other’s way, there’s a worse mess, such as we witnessed
Saturday on Stagg field. And if the band happens to be a tip-top j
outfit from the ranks of our visitors, we have failed as hosts and
insulted our guests. And if the two football teams happen to be
composed of ten-year old children who (all respect for the virility

A week of thorough preparation
has been started by the Purdue
football team in preparation for
their important game with North-
western in the new Purple stadium
Saturday afternoon. Although the
Boilermakers are doped to take a
handsometrimming, they are primed
to stage their hardest battle of the
year, notwithstanding their four
hard contests up to date.

As this game will be the Wildcats
homecoming a record crowd is ex-
pected to turn out and fill the sta-
dium. Purdue, as usual, will send
up a strong group of loyal rooters.

Northwestern holds the slim edge
of a single game out of thirteen
played since 1895, tl e records show-
ing that the Wildcats 13-9 victory-
last year put them one to the good.
In all these years not a single tie
has occured.

After the games Saturday, Ohio
State, Michigan and Northwestern
seem to be the most probable contend-
ers for the championship. Purdue also
has a record of 1,000 per cent, though
having one tie to tl eir standing.

Northwestern because of its easy
schedu e is picked to go through with-
out a defeat. They, have yet to play

an intensely interesting match as both
teams are as yet undefeated. North-
western won with east its second vic-

Michigan is favored over Wisconsin

tough breaks. Michigan will undoubt-

Over two hundred have entered the
Intramural cross country run to be
held on Nov. 10.

Men who intend to participate in the
race and have not yet intered must
take a physical examination today.
Report at the I-M office between 9:15
and 11:30 and see Dr. Reed who will
take charge of the examination.

Three men are necessary to maxe a
team and three men of a team must
finish in order to receive points. Many
of the two hundred men are practicing
on Stagg Field daily under the super-
vision of Coach Stagg. Any one may
enter these classes which are held at
11 and 5:30 o’clock.

There is a large array of prizes for
the winners. They consist of a large
trophy to the winning team; a cup to
the runners-up, and a smaller cup to
the third place winners. A gold med-
allette will be awarded to the first-
place winner, and a silver medallette
to the runner-up. Third to tenth place
wisners will receive bronze medallettes.

There is still a chance for those men
whn have not had a chance to enter
and wish to do so. See Harry Ault
either at the Sigma Nu house or at the
Intramural office.

There is a new event this year which
if it is a success will be made an an-
nual affair. This is the graduate Cross
Country Run. It also will take place
on November 10, over the two and a
half mile course in Washington Park
but will be held after the undergrad-
uate race which starts at 3:45. The
prizes will consist of three medals,
gold, silver and bronze to the first,
second, and third place winners.

Intramural athletics were given a
setback by the weather yesterday af-
ternoon. Snow accompanied by a
heavy wind caused the horseshoe
games to be postponed and, for a
while, threatened to hang the ‘no
games’ sign on the touchball schedule.

However, the Cardinals and Ro-
mans insisted that their game be play-
ed as did the Mars and Burtons with
the result that the Cards took the
large end of a 6 to 0 score in the first
game and the Mars gang walked off
the field victors in the second mix-up.
The score was 2 to 0.

In the Cards-Romans game Landis
intercepted a pass and raced 45 yards
through the persistent snowflakes for
a touchdown. The Mars’ victory was
the result of an incomplete Burton
pass, hurled from behind the goal line

GAME OF ALL GAMES DRAWS NEAR;

FROSH IN ILLINOIS FORMATIONS

Kyle Anderson Will Be Ready To Face Conquerors
Of Penn; Stan Reuse’s Ankle Injury

Not Serious

By Bob Stern

It’s an old annual custom, this Il-
lini game, a custom that’s tradition at
Chicago. It’s also a ferocious annual
struggle. This year’s battle gives much
promise of being of more than ordin-
ary ferocity, for the results of the las'
year struggles have been unsightly
marks on the Maroon sheets and Coach
Stagg is pointing his warriors for
bl od ’his week, deep orange and blue
Illini blood.

Last night the start was made on the
intensive week of training that will
culminate in perfect condition for the
game. Every man on the squad who
did not get into the Ohio fray went
into the hard scrimmage against the
freshmen who were.lined up accord-
ing to the Illinois defense style. Dy-
gert, Cusack, Klein and Rayson com-
posed the backfield that started and
later McKinney and Reed were sent in
for the last two. Tackling the dummy
had been in order before the scrim-
mage to iron out the errors and after
the lesson was over the squad split
into two parts.

The second part, consisting of las’
week’s starters, put in a driving hour
at signal practise under the eye of the
Old Man. Passing was stressed and
Apitz and Krogh at the ends worked
hard. The backfield of Marks, Me-

the field almost his old self again.

The only other casualities of the
Buckeye game were several bad
bruises. Ken Rouse received a severe
bruise in the side and will be forced
to wear a pad for a time. The team
however with all of the men in shape
will be in tip-top condition for the
Illini engagement.

Campbell Dixon, assistant coach,
who witnessed the Illinois Penn game
was vefy much impressed with the
capabilities of uppke’s men. However
the Maroons have had plenty of ex-
perience against wide running forma-
tions in the last two weeks and the
team should be able to stop the run-
ning attack of ‘Frosty’ Peters and his
mate, Bud Stewart.

Dear Turk:

I auott this, perhaps inaccurately,
from Edna St. Vincent Millay—

THURSDAY

And it I love you Wednesday—

Well, what is that to you.

I do not love you Thursday,
So much is true . . .'

And why you come complaining

Is more than I can see—

I loved you Wednesday . . yes.
But what is that to me?

COMING home from the Score

GREEK PLEDGE KICKS
OVER TRACES; SAYS

FRATERNITY IS BUNK

A fraternity man has revolted with-
in the ranks.

“Fraternities arc a bad influence on
the Freshman and seek to build up
their resources by taking the fresh-
man’s money.’’ This was the state-
ment was made in the discussion held
by the Freshman Forum yesterday
afternoon.

The discussion was as to the advis-
ability of a freshman boy or girl join-
ing a fraternity or club in his or her
first quarter. fThe affirmative was
taken by Don Rosenthal, president,
and the negative was taken by Gene
Weafer. Both men are members of
fraternities.

The meeting was the second which
the Forum has held this year. Others
will occur on alternate Monday after-
noons. These meetings will be held
to discuss campus problems, and to
stimulate Freshman public opinion.

WOMEN CAN’T EQUAL

SAYS ALIEN DOCTOR

“If the modern woman continues to
have he rideal at about seventy-five
pounds, there will be no more Ven-
uses de Milo in tlw generations to
come.”

Thus briefly the Toronto Star
quotes Dr. Bruno Roselli, Italian sa-
vant of Vassar College, who points out
the difference between the modern
ideal of beauty and the beauty of cen-
turies ago. Dr. Roselli spoke before
the Women’s Canadian Club of To-
ronto this afternoon on Leptis Magna,
ancient Roman city which Italian geol-
ogists are now unearthing in the des- j
ert near Tripoli.

“Woman becomes physically as well I
as spiritually, just what she wants to
become. The Venus de Milo shows
an entirely different ideal of beauty
than that which prevails at the pres-
ent day,” he said:

SECOND CONCERT OF
YEAR BY SYMPHONY

ORCHESTRA AT 4:15

The second concert of the season
will be given by the Chicago Sym-
phony Orchestra this afternoon at 4:15
in Mandel hall. As in the first per-
formance, the program will include
modern musical selections, many of
them new even to seasoned concert at-
tendants.

The orchestra will play as its open-
ing number, Glinka’s “Overture to
Russian and Ludmilla,” and will fol-
low with a Symphony by Rachman-
inoff, and Strauss’ Prelude and Waltz
from “Intermezzo.” The tone poem
“Finlandia,”. Opus 26, Number 7 will
close the program.

RETALIATION

Don’t think that I won’t harbor long
That leer which crossed your face last
n’ght

When you were sure that I was wrong
And you could sneer in being right.

Because I shivered in the air

And mentioned that the night was
cold—

You wrapped your coat once more
around,

And whispered I was getting old. .

Yet coldness has its proper place
Whose precincts I don’t dare distort.
But if you’d had . . a different face
My coldness would have been cut)
short!

The most welcome call
to smoke ever sounded

NEVER was there a smoke invita-
tion that could compare with
’’Have a Camel!”

On swirling city streets. In the
roadster as it bounds over the hills.
In the study or by the fireside, no
other smoking phrase is so pro-
vocative of enjoyment and friend-
ship. In its realization comes a
boundless sense of gratitude and
contentment.

That is because Camels are the
favored smoke of millions of ex-
perienced and successful men. To

R

ever-increasing millions who have
tried them all, who could well
afford to pay more, Camels are the
first and only choice. Since the
dawn of smoking, there has never
been a success like Camel’s.

Camel preference is the inevi-
table expression of Camel quality.
No other cigarette made is like
Camels. No other smoke was ever
so smooth and mellowy mild. For
your own high pleasure, we invite
you to rise to the world’s most cele-
brated smoke call. Have a Camel!
