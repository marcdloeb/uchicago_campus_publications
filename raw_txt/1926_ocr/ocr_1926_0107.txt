Custom

Tocques, designating the

class

standing of university men and wom-
en will appear on the campus next
week, as the result of final action
taken by the Undergraduate council
yesterday afternoon.

Colors for are various classes have
been designated, and the caps will
be available at the university book-
store as soon as delivery can be ob-
tained, Charles Anderson, president
of the council, announced following
the meeting. Seniors will wear caps
all maroon in color. Junior men and
women may be recognized by all
white caps. Sophomores will wear
tocques of white with maroon tas-
sels, and green caps with maroon
tassels will be donned by freshmen.

Wearing of tocques to indicate
class standing is an old custom of
the University, revived by the Under-
graduate council, which decided sev-
eral weeks ago that the caps should
re-appear on the campus, but de-
. ferred final action, and the selection
of colors until yesterday.

Sold At Bookstore

The bookstore has ordered the
tocques, and expects to receive a

shipment early next

$1 each.

Every student is

week, Anderson
expected to be

urged by the
in this plan by

securing a tocque as soon as they
are available, and wearing it on the
campus. An announcement will be
made when the caps are received.

A long-felt need for some method
of making obvious the class stand-
ing of both then and women students
of the undergraduate body will be
met by the practice of wearing
tocques, the council feels, and it is
believed that a better class spirit will
thus be encouraged among the mem-
bers of the four groups.

Hold Student Meeting

Another old custom will also be re-
vived by the council, it was decided
yesterday. An open meeting of that
body will be held in Classics 10 Jan-

BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY
CHOOSES PROF. KOCH
NATIONAL SECRETARY

At the annual meeting of the
Society of Biological Chemists held
at Cleveland on December 28-30, the
Department of Physiological Chem-
istry was well represented. Among
those attending were Assistant Pro-
fessor Martin E. Hanke, Dr. Ida
Kraus-Ragins, Mr. Joseph Tuta, Miss
Kathryn Knowlton and Professor F.
C. Koch. Two papers were read by
members of the staff and six papers
by graduate students were read by
title. Professor F. C. Koch was
elected Secretary of the Society of
Biological Chemists. •

The University has accepted a fel-
lowship offered to the Department
of Physiological Chemistry by E. R.
Squibb and Sons. This fellowship is
offered to aid in the study of internal
secretions of the male glands. Mr.
L. C. McGhee has been appointed to
the fellowship beginning with the
Winter Quarter.

plained that a number of students
with poor physical culture records
were warned last fall that they
must make a grade of C or better,
or face suspension. Those who

dean, and if they lacked sufficient
reason for their deficiency, were
suspended.

Plan Erection Of
International House

Plans are being formulated to
build an International House in Chi-
cago patterned after that of New
York, which was completed last year.
Whereas the one in New York is for
those attending any college in the
city, this will be exclusively a Uni-
versity project.

A committee is making an effort to
determine the approximate cost,
plans, and probability of its success.
“A questionnaire has been sent to
foreign student studying at the Uni-
versity and the answers that have
been received indicate a very favor-
able consensus of opinion,” said Prof.
Paul Goode, of the Geography de-
partment, who is also a member of
the President’s committee on foreign
students.

Results of numerous experiments
on the effect of cocaine on the hu-
man body were revealed recently by
the University authorities. The ex-
periments were conducted by Dr. A.
L. Tatum of the pharmacological lab-
oratory under the auspices of the
American Medical association and
were performed on all types of ani-
mals. The results of the experiments
are expected to cause a reduction in
the number of deaths that occur
every year due to accidental poison-
ing by cocaine.

A careful study of the problem
by Dr. Tatum has revealed death in
cocaine poisoning to be due essen-
tially to the failure of the respiratory
center in the medulla. Cocaine poi-
sons the brain as well as the respira-
tory center. Proceeding on the the-
ory that if the manifestations of
brain poisoning are prevented by
adequate methods, the respiratory
center is made far more resistant.
Dr. Tatum administered in a high
type of laboratory animal, under a
heavy dose of cocaine, veronal and
paraldehyde, drugs which depress

Drop in Disease

Fatality Rate

Diphtheria has become immensely less
of a scourge to Chicago and the whole
country: typhoid fever as a fatal dis-
ease has been brought under control;
scarlet fever has been attacked with new
weapons, and its eventual defeat is fore-
seen.

Thse are some of the chapters in “The
Conquest of Disease,” which is to be
described next Monday evening, Jan.
11, in Orchestra hall, by Prof. Edwin
O. Jordan, chairman of the department
of bacteriology in the University. The
lecture is one of the series which the
University is giving for the general
public. Dr. Jordan is a well known in-
vestigator and teacher, and is frequently
consulted by the city of Chicago and

Prof. Harvey Carr of the Univer-
sity’s psychology department has
been elected president of the Ameri-
can Psychological Association. This
distinction was conferred upon the
Chicago man at the thirty-third an-
nual convention of that body, held
at Ithaca, N. Y., last week.

Winning the office of treasurer,
Prof. Edward S. Robinson brought
further honor to the University, while
Prof. L. L. Thurstone, the other Chi-
cago representative, was elected to
member in the governing council of
the association. Dr. F. W. Fernberg-
er of the University of Pennsylvania
is secretary.

“The distinction which has been
given to Prof. Carr is one that is
highly valued,” declared Prof. Robin-
son, in speaking of his colleague. “I

the brain far more than the medulla.
Diminish Effects

In this way it was found possible
to so.diminish the harmful effects of
the cocaine poisoned brain that the
minimal fatal dose of cocaine could
be raised from two to three times.

Through the encouragement and
financial support from the American
Medical association Dr. Tatum has
been able to work on a high type of
laboratory animal including the
monkey—animals with great brain
complexity. It has thus become evi-
dent that the influence of the higher
brain centers exert a greater dele-
terious effect on the low medullary
centers. Removal of the influence of
the higher brain functions by ap-
propriate means permits of more
successful treatment of acute cocaine
poisoning in animals with higher
brain development. The investigators
have every reason to believe, it is
stated, that acute cocaine poisoning
in man should be still more amen-
able to this treatment than is the
case in lower animals.

Continue Tests

The investigators conducted their
experiments in the old laboratory of
physiological chemistry and pharma-
cology at the University. It is ex-
pected that continued tests will be
made in this field when the new
physiology building is opened as part
of the University’s enlarged medical
program, offering more efficient sci-
entific equipment. Additional data
will be secured on morphine addiction
as well as on. cocaine poisoning.

Jordan will present vividly,

both in his remarks and by stereopticon
pictures, the work of bacteriologists in
identifying and foiling the tiny but dead-
ly enemies of health. In nearly every
case it is the discovery of the bacillus—
a discovery generally made in the labor-
atory of some university—that has made
possible the “conquest.” Thus, Dr.
Jordan will show graphically the curve
of the death rate from tuberculosis, from
1812 to 1911, with a sharp and consist-
ent drop beginning in 1882, when the
tubercle bacillus was discovered.

Club Women Join
In Yearbook Drive
For Subscriptions

Club women have now joined the
group of salespersons selling sub-
scriptions for the Cap and Gown. The
idea was started by Inter-Club coun-
cil which according to Catherine
Campbell, a member of the organ-
ization, hoped not only to encourage
a larger participation in campus af-
fairs on the part of the club wom-
en, but also to create a spirit of
working as a group instead of as in-
dividual clubs. All of the women’s
clubs have entered the contest, and
preparations have been made for a
large thermometer which will register
the increasing sales of the different
clubs.

The club women will collect one
dollar on each subscription and the
balance will be payable by March
10, contrary to a report in a recent
issue of The Daily Maroon to the ef-
fect that subscribers had until June

Mack Evans Holds
Try-Outs For Choir

Choir tryouts are being held this
week in the studio on the second
floor of Mitchell Tower from 11:30
until 11:45, from 2:00 until 2:30,
and 4:30 to 6 until January 12. Mack
Evans, director of the choir will hear
students desiring to try-out. So-
pranos are especially needed.

According to Mr. Evans, no previ-
ous training is necessary, the ability
to carry a simple tune on the key in
a reasonably smooth voice being the
chief requisite. Students interested
have been urged to come and try-
out.

Approved of the League’s decision
in awarding the Mosul oil fields to
Irag under British mandate was
the highlight in an interview given
at the University yesterday by Prof.
Quincy Wright, of the Department of
Political Science who has just re-
turned from a survey of the man-
date question in the near east.

“Iraq under this mandate recog-
nizes the Kurds, a race which Tur-
key claims is essentially Turkish,”
said Prof. Wright. “Turkey is afraid
of this autonomy because she believes •
that eventually the Kurds in Turkey
will join the nucleus already formed
and a revolutionary movement will
ensue. She continually shouts war,
but a substantial British loan would
probably bring quiet.”

Fear* Revolution*

Prof. Wright also explained why
Turkey was interested in getting into
Iraq, depicting the worry which at-
tend the recognition given the Kurds
by the British, a situation which the
Turks believe holds possibilities of
future revolution within their own
boundaries.

In the meantime, according to
Prof. Wright, the Kurds in Iraq are
perfectly content to remain under
the British mandate. The action of
the British has been, since the revolu-
tion of 1920, he said, in accordance
with the principle of following the
wishes of the native peoples, and the
Kurds, the main element in the pop-
ulation of the Mosul Villaget, would
prefer to remain with Iraq provided
the British mandate continues The

Mosul question
therefore, with
friction, despite
chairman of the
of investigation

has been settled,
the least possible
the fact that the
League’s committee
was a Hungarian

and therefore slightly favorable to
the Turks.

Outline* Turkey’* Stand

The Turks have had their eyes on
Iraq right along, because; first, the
Turkish national pact defined Turk-
ish boundaries and later included
this area; it has become, consequent-
ly, a point of honor with the Turks;
second, the Turks have an exceeding-
ly large Kurdish population which
they claim is essentially Turkish;

HUNTING A JOB

A student walks into the employment bureau. He asks, if the de-
partment thinks he could get a job while attending school. The
answer is a command t ofill out a red blank and check occupations
which he thinks he might fill the best. The department then tells
the student that it will notify him if anything turns up.

We should like to see a bureau or service equipped to do more
than this. We should like to see an employment bureau (call it what
you will) that will prescribe for the student. That will scientifically
discover for what profession or business the student is best fitted.
What his natural abilities and talents seem to point toward.

Perhaps the department could do more than even that. It might
prescribe his course of study, and be the means of directing his ener-
gies in the shortest route to the end which he might have attained
after a series of unfortunate and costly experiences.

We do not believe that the employment bureau should have on
hand a staff of palm-readers; but we hope that some day the Univer-

sity can actively help its students to answer the question

THE CLUBS CO-OPERATE

CAMPUS club women have formed themselves into a corps of
sales-persons in an effort to promote Cap and Gown sales At a
meeting of the Inter-club council, representatives of the various clubs
decided to join in aiding one of the prominent activities on campus.

As one body, these women are making an endeavor to reach ev-
eryone. Plans have been made for the systematic canvassing of fac-
ulty, alumnae and students.

These women are making a valiant effort to aid in the selling
of the yearbook. They need co-operation, however, from the entire
student body. Will they get it?

THE FRESHMEN AT WORK

'T'HE freshmen are on a working basis. Green caps, stunts in the
•^ Circle, a class council instead of prematurely-elected officers and
the leadership of Charles Anderson—all these have done their work;
and now the freshmen are doing things.

Next Monday they will make nominations for permanent officers.
Next Friday they will hold a big banquet in the Commons, and meet
the candidates there. A Freshman banquet is something new. It is
a sign of life. It shows that the new class is organized,—that its
members know each other, have learned to work in unison, and are
♦
ready for action.

We owe thanks to The Green Cap, to the class council, to Ander-
son—and to the freshmen.

ing daily with the track team it appears
as if the Maroon runners will have a
fairly strong squad. The loss of Mc-
Farlane, Bourke, and Russel from last
year’s team, will be keenly felt. Also
Spence, the crack half miler, may not
compete because of poor hkealth.

Cusacks to Star

In the two mile the coaches will rely
on Owens, crack cros country runner,
Hegovic and Dugan. The mile will
find Capt. Jimmy Cusack, who won the
Conference last year with 4:23, the
mainstay. Jimmy will also compete in
the half mile and will be assisted by
his brother Jack. Kelso and other sopho-
mores. McFarlane, last years champ
in the 440. will he missed in his spe-
cialty. Beal, Ravenscroft. John Spence,
and Mickleberry will make a fairly fast
mile relay team.

In the dashes two "C' men. Kern-

valuable addition to the squad. Wedde!

has made 6 feet I inch in the high jump
and can pole vault around 11 feet, which
should net the Maroons a few points
this year. Hobschied. the husky tackle,

?>, when Indiana is met in a dual meet
at Bartlett gym. Coach Eck predicts
this opening meet to lie a close one, and
a difficult one for his team, in spite of
the rumor that the Hoosiers are one of
the weakest of the Big Ten squads. Just
how effective the short training period
has been in the conditioning of his men
will be ascertained in this encounter,
and the success of the Maroons will de-
pend a lot on this fact.

Swim Coach Calls
For New Material

Coach MacGillivray wishes to call
forth the attention of any men who
are interested in swimming the back-
stroke event, preferably sophomores
or upperclassmen. The hackstroke
crew has been depleted through in-
eligibility and is now the weakest
point of the Maroon natators.

The men that showed up well in
the past intramural swimming con-
tests, are especially urged to try out
for this Varsity berth position, the
chance being of the best for any
men who have ambitions of wearing
the campus letter in future years.

Friday night next will be the first
appearance of the tank team in ac-
tion this year, when the Varsity will
defend itself against the combined
strength of the Freshman and Alum-
ni teams. There will be no admission
charge. This will be one of the best
opportunities for the student body to
witness their swimming representa-
tives since with exception of the In-

Change Swim Rules
In Conference Meets

The regulations pertaining to
the slippery art of swimming have
been changed for the coming sea-
son. The plunge event having
been replaced by the new medley
relay, which in turn consists of
three hundred yard sprints in
crawl, breastroke and backstroke
fashion. The Illinois captain elect
of the swimming crew is an ex-
pert at the plunge but will prob-
ably have to resign his position in
accordance with the new ruling.

The two twenty yard crawl has

been doubled thus making it
essary for the men to swim
hundred and forty yards, in
of the former distance. The

nec-
four
lieu
best

known alteration of course is the
introducing of the Water Polo
game into the Big Ten Confer-
ence, to take the place of last
year’s wrestling water basketball
combination.

WHAT of IT?

yjoi^t Mot\ceN»wy

Each year the University
holds two great national inter-
scholastic meets, one in basketball
and one in track, and in addition it
promotes, if memory serves, track,
swimming and tennis competitions
for the high schools of the county.
Northwestern university floats a na-
tional high school indoor track meet
yearly, and the annual state track
and basketball meets are run off at
the University of Illinois.

The gentlemen who are concerned
with running these various competi-
tions among the three universities,
when asked what the purpose or in-
tention of their school in carrying on
such activities for the high school
athletes is, have always been wont to
talk somewhat vaguely about the
great traditions of amateur sport, the
broadening effect of ueh meets on the
mind of the growing boy, and to
give other impersonal and altruistic
explanations for the being of such
high schoAl gatherings. Meanwhile,
it is an open secret that the real
reason the universities spend time
and money on the high school boys
is that they expect that a few of
the athletes may come to their col-
lege.

It has always been somewhat of
a puzzle to me why Chicago gets
so little in the way of athletic ma-
terial out of these meets. Welcomed
cordially every year by Mr. Stagg,
fed on what we may call the fat of
the fraternity houses during their
stay, well housed, taken to the
stockyards and other points of in-
terest, shot full of talk by double-
gripping handshakers as to the
merits of the dear old school, the
athletes still persist in turning their
footsteps away from the Midway to-
wards such centers of learning as
Oberlin, Denison, Coe, Beloit, An-
tioch, and even Illinois.

Something is obviously wrong
somewhere. Perhaps it’s in the rush-
ing system, although certainly the
boys concerned in these matters us-
ually get in their fell work in smooth
and insidious fashion. Perhaps it’s
in the high school boys, and perhaps
as I have occasionally suspected, it
may even be in the dear old school
itself.

Annual Invitation Meets

Following its custom of encourag-
ing and promoting amateur sports
in high school and prep institu-
tions, the University athletic de-
partment will hold its seventh annual
city and suburban indoor field and
track meet within the next month.
Three separate meets will be held,
the first on January 16th, the second
on the 29th and the third on the
12th of February.

These meets usually bring out the
cream of the track talent in Cook
county and this year will be no ex-
ception. The coaches of a great num-
ber of the suburban schools have had
their men priming all fall in prepar-
ation for this event.

The men will be divided into a
junior and senior class. All those
under sixteen will compose the ju-
niors and they will have the same
events but of course the competition
will not be so fast. There will be
eleven events in each class consisting
of the following:

50 yard dash

50 yard low hurdles

50 yard high hurdles

220 yard dash

440 yard run.

“FROSH TRACK SQUAD
IS STRONGEST SINCE
WAR”—LONNIE STAGG

This year’s Freshman Track Squad
is heralded by Coach Lonnie Stagg
as one of the most powerful Green
Shirt aggregations since the war. If
predictions run true, some of the
men on this year’s yearling squad will
so bolster up the varsity hopes next
year as to give Chicago one of the
strongest four-mile relay teams in
the country.

These are “Sparky” Williams, the
Hyde Park star, who should reel off
the mile in about 4:25 next year,
Bourke, who placed second to Joie
Ray in a recent newspaper meet, and
Verg Gist, state champion in the
scholastic half-mile, who can also
run the mile in about 4:30. These

Cage Team Practices
For Hawks In Secret

Coach Nels Norgren is taking
no chances on somebody copping
off the signals of his proteges and
has ordered secret practice for
every day this week. Then with-
out the gazes of the inquisitive
spectators to distract the team, the
players engage in mastering new
plays till long past the supper
hour.

The game with Iowa looms large
in the mind of Capt. Alyea and his
mates and if practice means any-
thing the Hawkeyes are due for a
strong battle. Norgren will rely
on the same lineup that worked in
the Drake game, to pit against
Coach Barry’s charges on Satur-
day night. The reserves, using the
Iowa style of play, worked against
the varsity and Norgren was pleas-
ed with the strong defense of the
Maroon guards.

WRESTLING TEAM

GAINS STRENGTH

The burdens of Coach Voores are
gradually becoming heavier, for day
by day the ranks of the wrestlers be-
come more numerous. The latest re-
cruits are three numeral men from
the Freshman football veterans,
Losch, Baker and Herschfield by
name. The addition of these and sun-
dry others who have recently ap-
peared, has inflated the wrestling
squad to husky proportions.

Tabulations according to individ-
ual events show many weak points
though for in only one event can a
conference place be counted on. Gra-
ham in the 137 pound class is ex-
pected to shine in the big meet. Five
men are struggling for first place on
the team among the heavy weights;
three men are doing the same in the
147 pound class; four are out for
the 117 pound position and so on
down the line. The loss of Ball, who
graduated last year is badly felt
among the 127’s but several aspir-
ants are striving manfully to fill hjs
place. Altogether only two of last
year’s men are left but the coach
expects to develop a fighting team
from the abundance of new men.

Announcement Closes Work of Intra-Mural Department for
Autumn Quarter; Begin New Quarters

Work Today

With the result of the fall sport
program officially compiled, the intra-
mural department announced last
night that the Kappa Sigma fratern-
ity topped the list with a participa-
tion point rating of 195. The Phi
Gamma Delta group are next in the
standing with a total of 170 points,
while the Delta Sigma Phi, last year’s
leaders are third with 165 1-2, just
ahead of the Tau Delta Phi with 165
points.

The other fraternities have an ex-
cellent opportunity to forge ahead
of the leaders during this quarter
as several sports, including basket-
ball and foul-shooting, will be con-
ducted. The race will be decided at
the completion of the spring quar-
ter when the cup will be awarded.

The points were awarded on the
basis of entering all the sports, ful-
filling all the scheduled engagements,
and winning in competition. En-
trance in the major sports merited
50 counters; league winning, 10;
runners-up, 5; University champion.

author of “Lecture Notes on Aptics,”
which will soon be published by the
University Press. The book tells of the
methods used in his more important ex-

of the interferometer.

Among other books recently published
of special interest to those investigating
social science, is “The City,” by R. E.

a story of human behavior in urban en-

“The Panchatantra,” translated from

Death Rate Decreases

As regards typhoid fever in this re-
gion, the death rate before the opening
of the drainage canal ranged about 20
per hundred thousand, sometimes rising
as high as 170. The average death rate
in 1906-10, even after the canal was
opened, as high as 15.8. But in 1924,
largely owing to chlorination of the
water supply, the death rate had fallen
to only 1.6 per hundred thousand. This
was the outcome of laboratory work
dealing with the antiseptic action of cer-
tain chemicals on the typhoid germs.

Dr. Jordan wlil discuss also the work
of Dts. George F. and Gladys Dick, of
Chicago, who discovered the germ of
scarlet fever and an antitoxin whose use
is becoming wide-spread. He will speak
of anti-mosquito warfare which, in some
parts of the country, has enormously
reduced fatalities from malaria.
