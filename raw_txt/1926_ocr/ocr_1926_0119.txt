VICE-PRES. TUFTS RESIGNS

WOODWARD TO
ASSUME DUTIES

AFTER APRIL 1

Wants More Time For
Literary Pursuits,
Tufts States

By Deemer Lee

Desiring to devote more time to
teaching and literary work, Prof.
James H. Tufts will resign his duties
as vice president and Dean of Facul-
ties of the University on April 1. He
will, however, retain the post of pro-
fessor and head of the Department of
Philosophy.

Prof. Frederic C. Woodward of the
Law school has been elected vice
president by the Board of Trustees,
it was also announced. He has al-
ready been relieved of a part of his
teaching duties in order to become of
immediate assistance to the presi-
dent, but his term will not begin
officially busy until April 1.

“It has been a busy three years,”
Mr. Tufts told The Daily Maroon
yesterday. “Three years ago when
I was asked by Pres. Burton to be
vice president, I planned to devote i
half my time to teaching and half to
to the duties of administration, but
the administration work soon de-
veloped into a full time job.”

When the great campaign drive
• began, Dean Tufts’ duties increased
as Pres. Burton found it necessary
to devote much of his time to the
drive. “I found that the work of
administration had to he one by the
job, and not by the hour.”

He is now going to do some of the
things on which he has had his heart
set for many years—te writing of
several books. One will be a “His-
tory of American Thought.” He will
also begin immediately on a revision
of his part of the “Dewey and Tufts”
text on Ethics, which was published
in 1908.

“Though the vice presidency car>
ries with it much work and worry,
I have also had many pleasant ex-
periences. I shall always remember
the day Prof. Lillie walked into my
office and said that he and Mrs. Lillie
would’like to donate a building to the
University for purposes of biological
research.”

On receiving announcement of his
election to take Dean Tufts’ position
as vice president. Prof. Woodward
said: “I consider it a great honor and
a great responsibility to suceed a
man so distinguished in scholarship
and so beloved by the University,
community as Dr. Tufts.

“The duty of the vice president,

CONTINUE CLASSES
IN SOCIAL DANCING

The social dancing class for men
and women of the graduate schools
will be continued during the winter
quarter on Monday nights. Dancing
will begin promptly at 7 in the main
gymnasium of Ida Noyes hall. All
persons wishing to join the class have
been requested to bring their tuition
receipts.

The statement printed in The Daily
Maroon on Jan. 15 regarding the
social dancing class was incorrect, j

Neophyte members of Sigma
Nu and Kappa Sigma are going to
show the Trianon and White City
hoof-shakers just how it’s done,
and they’re not going to reveal
their prowess before admiring I
f raters around the fraternity
house hearth. No, sir! These
more or less accomplished under-
lings will shake their stuff at
neighborhood theatres.

For it’s “hell week” at the
Greek houses, and the brothers are
“taking it out” on the battered,
withered pledges while the “tak-
ing out” is good. And among the
things that are fit for print is the
Charleston contest. Two, in fact:
Sigma Nu’s at the Frolic theatre
and Kappa Sig’s at that palace of
amusement known as the Harding.

The time is to be announced
later. Admission is only a dime
a throw.

Colonel Josiah C. Wedgwood, M. P.,
D. S. C., member of the British cab-

a leader in the British labor party,
will speak in Harper assembly hall
at the University this afternoon at,

tine.”

For many years he has been a zeal-
ous champion of Zionism, supporting
the cause both in Great Britain and

he delivered a series of lectures in the
interests of the movement. Although

Students Expostulate Over Tuition;

Resent New Fifteen Dollar Raise

By Milton S. Mayer

After a futile search for diverg-
ence of opinion on the proposed raise
in quarterly tuition, the Daily Ma-
roon is able to print only one point
of view—that of opposition.

For of ten prominent undergrad-
uates only one showed the slightest
inclination toward receiving the news
with good grace.

Thomas Mulroy, former head of
the Interscholastic meets and busi-
ness manager of The Daily Maroon,
stared vacantly into space for about
five minutes, and upon recovery is-
sued several unofficial statements.
However he did declare that “no
statement of my opposition to the
plan can be too emphatic. Why Uni-
versity of Chicago students should
pay more for what is apparently the
same education that other colleges
afford their students is more than
I can see.”

Catherine Campbell, vice-president
of the senior class, was found at her
home, and as Miss Campbell admits,

Poole Receives Choice on
Fifth Ballot; Elections

Close

George Poole was elected president
of the Freshman class in yesterday’s
election. The ballot, which was taken
on the Hare system, elected Poole
only after fifth choices had been tak-
en into consideration and then by a
score of 251 to 229. Perry Thomas
was runner-up.

Janet Good received a substantial
majority to win the office of vice-
president over Violet Holmes, by a
vote of 266 to 235. Alice Wiles went
into office as secretary on a landslide
293 to 205; while Rainey Bennett
was elected by the tremendous ma-
jority of 171 votes.

Morgenstern Leads On First Ballot

George Morgenstern, a non-frat-
ernity candidate, led the list for pres-
ident on the first ballot with a count
of 106 to 100, Perry Thomas being
runner-up. Poole was third.

On the second ballot Perry Thomas
assumed the lead over Morgenstern
by a count of 118 to 112. Poole was
again third.

On the third ballot the positions
remained the same, 133 votes hav-
ing been cast for Thomas, 129 for
Morgenstern, and 119 for Poole.

After counting the fourth choice,
Thomas and Poole were found to be
tied with 170 votes each. Morgen-
stern had received 154. Poole was
victorious on the final ballot by a
score of 251 to 229.

Bennett Elected On First Ballot

Rainey Bennett was the only can-
didate to receive his position on the
first ballot. He defeated Frank Car-
son for treasurer by a vote of 339 to
167.

Alice Wiles came within a few
votes of receiving a deciding judg-
(Continued on page 2)

if she did not possess so strong a con-
stitution, she would have fainted
dead away. “Why . . why . . why, it’s
terrible!” exclaimed the stricken
lady. And then to the writer: What’s
the cheapest transportation between
the campus and the poor house?”

Charles Anderson, president of the
Undergraduate council, blanched and
in an awed voice made the following
statement: “Golly, Milt, is that a
fact?” Assured that it was a fact,
Mr. Anderson admitted that although
the increase in scholarship was com-
mendable, he did not care to support
the intellectuals at his own starva-
tion.

While the general concensus is
that University students are able to
comply with the new fee, the plan is
considered far from advisable.

The raise in tuition will go into
effect notwithstanding. And many
new edifices will grace the Midway
campus.

But who will fill these spacious
structures? Not we. No, we shall
have starved to death long since.

Campus Artists
to Entertain at

Senior Banquet

Fred Van Ammon and his concer-
tina, Don McGinnis and Seward Cov-
ert in a double act, and Lois Rus-
sell will provide the entertainment
for the senior class banquet to be
given Thursday at 7 in Ida Noyes
hall. Deans Edith Foster Flint and
Elizabeth Wallace will be the host-
esses for the occasion.

“All the talent on our program is
of the very best the University can
offer,” said Jeanette Baldwin, co-
chairman of the banquet, “the per-
formers are all well known on cam-
pus and need no introduction to the
student body.” The menu for the
dinner has been announced as fol-
lows: veal cutlets, French fried po-
tatoes, buttered peas, fruit salad, ice
cream, cake and coffee.

'rickets may be obtained fur ninety
cents from members of the commit-
tee in charge, from members of the
Senior class council, at the bookstore,
at the information office in the Press
building, and in the check room of

ANNOUNCEDATE

FOR PLAYFEST

Give Performances On

Feb. 5 and 6

The Playfest, the annual Settlement
benefit production of the dramatic
association, will be presented on two
consecutive evenings, Friday and Sat-
urday, Feb. 5 and 6, it was announced
last night by Charles Cowan, busi-
ness manager. The production had
originally been planned for but one
evening, Friday, as in the past.

The great demand for reservations,
Mr. Coman states, is responsible for
the decision to give a second perform-
ance. Although tickets are not yet
even on sale, so many requests have
been received for blocks of seats that
Mandel hall will be incapable of ac-
commodating the crowds at a single
showing.

Last year the Playfest attracted an
immense crowd. Members of the as-
sociation point out that the cause to
which the proceeds are donated has
made the production one of the an-
nual society events of the University,
and they believe that its popularity
is rapidly increasing. A number of
clubs and fraternities, as well as or- ।
ganizations particularly interested
in the University Settlement and Day
Nurseries, are said to have expressed i

Phoenix to Tell
Story of Ponzi-

Fraternity-Cook

Hitherto unknown details of the in-

were disclosed today in personal let-
ters to a friend, unearthed by the
editor of The Phoenix.

The culinary artist in question, it
seems, was at the head of a financial
organization of extended dimensions,
and Ponzi-like characteristics. De-
tails of her exact plans for amassing
a fortune are included in these uni-
que epistles.

Inside information on life in a fra-
ternity house as it appears to a non-

private affairs of the correspondent
may be discovered by all who read.

In order to give the students of the
University who wish to read these
fascinating letters the opportunity to
do so, The Phoenix staff has decided
to run them in the January issue, out j

Federation Holds
First Open Meeting
_________________

The first Federation open council
meeting of the quarter will be held
tonight from 7 to 8 in the library
of Ida Noyes hall. Eleanor Rice,
president of the organization, will ;
lead the discussion which will form
the principal part of the program.

‘New Year’s Resolutions for Ac-
tivities” will be the subject of the
discussion. Various phases of activ-
ities will be considered under this I
topic. Such questions as, why do we
have activities? what is their value?
and how much time should be given
to them' will be discussed.

Development of Federation and
the changes that have taken place
within the organization since it was
founded will be outlined by Miss
Rice. All women on campus who
are interested have been invited to
attend. “We particularly hope that
women who are new on the campus
this quarter will be present to learn
about the organization.” Miss Pirc
continued.

Following a course which has been
found necessary by many American
universities during recent years; the
University will on July 1 next in-
crease its tuition charges to under-
graduates from $75 a quarter to $90
a quarter. Approval of this change
has been voted by the board of trus-
tees.

The board also approved of a plan
to make a considerable increase in
scholarships and remissions of tui-
tion for other reasons. Last year
such scholarships and remissions,
combined to make a total of about
$180,000. The increase contemplated
is expected to bring this figure to
more than $200,000 a year.

Tuition Was Too Low

Since there are four quarters in the
academic year at the University, the
maximum to be paid per year by
undergraduates will be $360. This
is lewer than the tuition charge made
by some eastern universities whose
year is divided into two semesters,
without any summer term.

It is pointed out that during the
last ten years the purchasing power
of a dollar has decreased approxi-
mately 40 per cent. Increases in
tuition charges have not kept pace
with this fall in the purchasing power
of the dollar, which affects univer-
sities as much as it does any other
institutions.

Costs Have Increased

It has always cost the University
more to educate a student than he or
she has paid; and even under the
new scale of tuition fees, this will be
the case. With the increase in all
living and buying costs, which make
the expenditures of the University,
salaries included, take an upward
tendency. An adidtion to tuition
charges as just authorized will, it is
stated, still be below what might be
charged in strict correspondence with
economic conditions.

President Max ‘Mason said: “In
taking this course, the University is
simply acting in accordance with eco-
nomic trends and in harmony with
the means many other universities
of similar standing have adopted for
greater revenue. The University has
by no means taken the lead in tuition

WOMEN SPEAKERS
TO TRYOUT TODAY

Try-outs for Women Speakers club
will be held today from 3 to 5 in the
Alumnae room of Ida Noyes hall. All
women interested in public speaking
may try out for membership in the
club.

The purpose of the organization is
to aid in the development of public
speaking. Individual personalities
and capacities of the members have
been stressed. While the main inter-
est of the club is in speaking, the
subjects discussed are limited only
hv the personal interests of the mem
bers.

DEAN TUFTS: AN APPRECIATION

By Max Mason.

TAEAN TUFTS has devoted his great ability whole-heartedly to the
administrative work of the University during the last three
years. He abandoned his work in philosophy at the call of Dr. Bur-
ton when Dr. Burton’s time was absorbed by the development pro-
gram, and carried on the work of the President’s office after Dr.
Burton’s death. Although desirous of returning to his work in
philosophy, he generously continued his administrative activities dur-
ing the present year, to aid me in the period of orientation. The

appreciation of his services is universal. It has meant everything to
me to have had the support of his unfailing soundness of judgment,
kindliness, and tact.

THE SMOKE CLEARS OFF

By Heloise

TTTOMAN has usurped man’s place in the barber chair, his place
’ ’ at the polls, his ideas and his work because man hasn’t been
“man enough" to prevent her doing it. Has she usurped his cigaret-
tes for the same reason?

From Drury Lane to Sacramento women’s ire has been aroused
at his protest. Why should men smoke? Why shouldn’t women
smoke? Man has found that the mental capacity of woman is of
such a caliber that she can vote intelligently. Man has found that
woman is capable of coping with delicate diplomatic situations, of
directing complicated business enterprises. But man protests at
woman s smoking cigarettes.

Some women smoke because their friends smoke, or because
they think it’s the “thing to do.” If a woman smokes merely to as-
sume a pose, or as an affection, she is insincere. She deserves the
condemnation that all insincere people deserve. But some women,
like some men, smoke because they want to, and for no other reason.

OLD—BUT WHAT ISN’T?

OUR story about Billy Sunday and the graduate student’s thesis
about him carried a false implication, and an implication that
we didn’t intend. The reader was led to this interpretation: that
Sunday’s method has just been found to be a rehash of older meth-
ods. Of course, Sunday makes no claim for novelty, would admit
without hesitation that his scheme is old. The question is not How
old is it? but How effective is it?

A valued friend of The Daily Maroon calls our attention to the
real issue in a letter, whose publication has been delayed:

To the editor:

I read with some interest your lead-
ing article in the issue for December
’, “Sunday Pulls Old Stuff; It Is Dis-
covered.” I am somewhat surprised
at the attitude of the Maroon in pub-
lishing this item. It is similar to the
attitude of many of the daily papers
which publish, as some new discovery,
a matter which has been well known
to the public for a long time. Mr. Sun-
day has been preaching for many years
and his method has been the same as
at present during the whole period.
Moreover this style of preaching,
though not expressed in such lurid
fashion as is the practice of Mr. Sun-
day, has been common for generations
in some paits of this country. There
is, therefore, nothing startling about
this supposed “discovery.”

Per contra, it is no more than fair

to Mr. Sunday to say that there is, and
has been, an element of real worth in
his ministry during the years. Per-
sonally I do not at all like his method.
I am confident that it does harm
among some classes of people. I think
that it exhibits a type of religion very
far from the highest. Nevertheless it
is true that he has reached a great
number of people who are not reached
by ordinary religious methods and has
reached them for good. Drunkards
have become sober, dishonest people
have become honest, frivilous people
have become serious-minded and have
taken hold of life in a genuine way,
scoffers have become devout, and
many such people have continued to
live upright and worthy lives. It is to
be granted that many cases have
proved to be superficial in their con-

version but that is true of the work
of other men whose method's are quite
different from Mr. Sunday’s. An en-
during conversation is something
which no minister can guarantee.
These facts should be taken into con-
sideration in any characterization of
Mr. Sunday and his work.

I remain

Yours sincerely,

F. J. Gudney,
Assistant Recorder.

Begin Play in Non-Greek Basket League

LOCAL NATATORS
ARE SUCCESSFUL

IN INITIAL MEET

Easily Defeat Indiana in Dual
Meet by Score of

49-20

Indiana swimmers were defeated
at Bartlett pool by the Maroon tank-
ers in th° first encounter of the local
swim team, 49-20. Experienced
swimming and a full house were the
main features of the water struggle.

Relay Team Wins

The Maroon quartet relay, com-,
posed of Noyes, Rittenhouse, Red-
field and Gilchrist had an easy time
in their event, vanquishing the Hoo-I
sier four by almost a tank length.
Time 122 2-5.

K. Mygdal made a successful de-1
but in the Conference by taking first
place away from Miller, the Bloom-
ington entry, in one of the most ex-
citing events contested. Diamond
trailed after Miller giving the Mac-
Gillivray squad a third place. Time
2:52.

Noya* Takes a First

In the forty yard crawl, Captain
Noyes'and Harry Ritten house touch-
ed off in one-two order, and timed
20 seconds flat

The four forty yard crawl, favored
Indiana who took first through Zais-
ier. Jerry Greenberg followed with
second place, and Charlie Lane con-
tributed a third. Time 5:50.

In the 150 yard backstroke M.
Jelinek battled his way to first place.
Jelinek was taken from the polo team
to refill the ranks of the ineligible
back stroke crew, and has developed
into a fast man in the hackstroke.
Kaats, also a new comer placed third.

Noyes Repeats

Noyes and Rittenhouse repeated J
their performances of the earlier;
part of the evening by capturing a
first and second respectively in the
100 yard crawl event.

In the dives Ed. Fellinger showed j
great style and took the leading hon- j
or, Tudor Wilder, his team mate, i
placing second with ease.

The medley relay trio, Jelinek, My-1
gdal and Redfield lost to Indiana.

The water polo game was a mere
swim away affair for the Maroons.
Captain Petrolowitz, with Hall.
Kroph. White. Greenberg and Gil-
christ. ended the game with a 16 to
0 count.

Oak Park Annexes

Opening Prep Meet

Oak Park high school won the first
of a series of three track meets being
staged at Bartlett gym by amassing
24% points, Saturday. University
High with 19% counters and Hyde
Park with 19 were close behind. Til-
den won the junior division of the
meet with 17 tallies.

Three track records were shattered
by the preppers and several records
were threatened. Kennedy of Uni-
versity High won the 50-yard low
hurdles with the time of :06 1-5 sec-
onds. Sullivan of Oak Park heaved
the 16-pound shot for a distance of
45 ft. 10 in. The Tilden Juniors
completed the record-breaking by
winning the relay in the time of
1:03 2-5.

Lunde of Oak Park gave a good
performance in the pole vault by as-
cending the bar at 10 ft. 6 in. Pat-
terson of Tilden wdn two firsts in the
50-yard dash and one of the quarter
mile runs.

Grid Enemies Will
Meet on Cage Floor

When the Northwestern five
clashes with Purdue on Saturday,
spectators may see the cream of
two football teams in action, re-
newing the grid rivalry of last |
fall. Capt. Barney Mathews,
Moon Baker, Christman, White,
and Fisher of Maurice Kent’s
regular cage team are well known
football heroes of the Evanston
campus.

The Boilermaker quintet boasts
some high class football material
of its own on its cage outfit, j
Spradling, Harmeson, Taube, Wil- 1
cox and Jolly were members of I
the Purdue eleven that almost
made the famous saying, “Stagg
fears Purdue” come true, when
the Maroons barely won, 6-0.
These men are now starring on
the Boilermaker basketball team,
and when they hook up with the
“Wildcats” the mud is certain to
fly and plenty of “flying tackles”
should result.

WHAT o/ IT?

^ebage Morgenstern

Yesterday had not progressed very
far when this department conceived
the trenchant—aye! laudable—idea
of presenting in its column this morn-
ing a statement from the people’s
choice for freshman class president.
The fact that the outcome of the 1
election was still cast over by a very. I
very black haze mooted little, once
this department had come to its deci-
sion. The problem was simple: it
would present not one, but two state-
ments—one in case of victory and
the other (highly more probable) in
the event of defeat. Accordingly,
Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, the crack
little boy reporter of “What of it?”, j
was despatched on the story. Now. as [
the Evening American is wont to J
say, now to the story!

VICTORY STATEMENT

The successful candidate (writes
Hannibal Hamlin EXCLUSIVELY
for THIS column) was tired but hap-
py after the rigors of the day. “You
may tell my constituents through
your column,” he said, “that my tri-
umph marks one more step towards
that Utopia for which we are all
yearning. I am proud of the support
of my loyal followers, who unflinch-
ingly went to the polls and did their
duty as every citizen should. I am
proud that they cast their ballots as
they did—for right and justice. I
pledge myself to ever uphold those
great principles and noble traditions
for which our fathers gave their life’s
blood through the centuries, and
which I again am proud to confident-
ly assert are the rock upon which
the independent party is built. I
shall never depart from those prin-
ciples and I shall never abuse the
trust of that group of nature’s noble-
men who put me in office. To do oth-
erwise were base and unworthy of me.
This is indeed the hap . . . d . . of . .

ZENITHS DEFEAT

ROMANS IN LAST

MINUTE OF PLAY

Packers Stage Rally But Di-
vinity Squad Leads

At End

Before a fairly large crowd of en-
thusiastic spectators, the Non-frater-
nity and Graduate leagues opened
their cage seasons with some spirited
basketball. Considering that this was
the first game ever played by the
Non-Greeks and the Post-Grads, the
brand of basketball displayed was far
from sloppy and gives promise of giv-
ing the fraternity teams some keen
competition

Zenith* Come From Behind

Coming from behind with some mi-
raculous shots, the Zeniths pulled the
big upset of the evening by downing
the Romans 25 to 23. The Romans
due to their better team work and
stellar playing of Taymor and Grai-
man and the accurate shooting of
Karras held a 23 to 18 lead with
but two minutes to play. The Non-
Greeks with the Radio nomenclature
then unleashed a deluge of baskets,
to eke out a win. The Romans played
without the services of their star
forward Lewis. Both sides displayed
good eyes for the basket but ragged
teamwork.

Divinity Win*

The Divinity School came through
with a win over the Packers Club by
the score of 19-15. At the end of the
half, the score was 13-6, and although
the Packers made a wonderful rally
in the last few minutes of the game,
they could not overcome this lead.
Cannon starred for the losers with
four baskets and one free throw,
while Dimmock counted four for the
winners.

TRACK SQUAD NEEDS
SPRINTERS, VERDICT

AFTER CLASS MEET

Track enthusiasts learned two
things at the Interclass meet on Fri-
day: one, that the varsity is ex-
tremely weak on speed, and two, that
the new freshmen are as promising a
lot as have ever appeared in Bartlett.

The first fact became noticeably
when the list of winners in the vari-
ous events was looked over. The
varsity, per usual, placed men in
every event, but places were not what
the coaches wanted most; the thing
they looked for and did not see was
the wholesale shattering of sprint
records.

The second turned out in the same
way.

SOPHAERIALISTS

DEFEAT Y. M. C. A.

Opening their season with a 949
to 913 victory over the strong Mil-
waukee Y. M. C. A. team, the Ma-
roon gymnasts showed remarkable
form for so early an exhibition, espe-
cially when the large number of soph-
omores and juniors contained on this
year’s Midway outfit is considered.
According to Coach Hoffer, it was the
excellent work of these men, espe-
cially the sophemores, that made the
meet so pleasing to him.

He had long been waiting to see
how his new men would perform in
the actual contest. It is difficult
enough for his candidates to secure
the perfect co-ordination, unfailing
nerve, and self confidence necessary

(Special to The Daily Maroon)
The Illini threw the conference

when it defeated Michigan’s bas-

game here. This is Michigan’s
fir*t defeat of the season.

a score of 39 to 31.

If Chicago wins from Purdue
tomorrow night it will be a par-
ty to a tie for first place with
Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio
State, and Illinois, each with a
percentage of 666. Right now
Purdue occupies the place
which Chicago may hold Wed-
nesday.

5 South Wabash Avenue

Bubbling over with well deserved
confidence as a result of their de-
cisive 17-15 triumph over the hither-
to undefeated Badger five, the Ma-
roons eased up a bit last night in
preparation for the Purdue game to-
morrow night. Coach Norgren is tak-
ing no chances on his proteges going
stale in view of the strenuous week
that awaits them.

Purdue Ace High Scorers

Coach Lambert’s Boilermakers
are the highest scoring combination
in the Big Ten, averaging the mere
sum of about thirty-five points a
game. The Maroons, on the other
hand, are the strongest defensive
team in the Conference having held
their opponents to 33 points in two
tilts. A most interesting battle
should ensue deciding whether a good
defense is better than a good of-
fense.

As a result of their brilliant ex-
hibition against Meanwell’s quintet,
the Midway is given an even chance
to down the flashy attack of Cap^
Spradling, Cramer and Co. Hoergei -
and McDonald stamped themselves
as the outstanding guards of the
season by holding the Wisconsin for-
wards, Behr and Andrews, to two

I’ve rubbed and pounded till my

Is better left unsaid—

as stated in the University by-laws
is to ‘cooperate with the president’.
I look forward with the keenest pleas-
ure to the opportunity of cooperating
with such a leader as President Ma-
son in his plans for the development
and betterment of our University.”
Prof. Woodward will continue part
of his teaching in the law school.
He was graduated in 1894 from
Cornell university. With the excep-
tion of three years when he prac-
ticed law in New York city, he has
taught law\ He taught at Northwest-
ern university for five years and then
at Stanford university for nine years.

THE UNIVERSITY has raised the
tuition rates twenty per cent. Cutting
classes soon will be a luxury.

Wonder if we’ll get any more j
grade points for our money?

Maybe it’# a well meant #tep toward
Higher Education!

ANYHOW we hope now that we’ll
be getting better service, entertain-1
ment, and all that sort of things.
Syncopation week in chapel, respect i
and solicitude from the instructors,;
or the truth about Queen Elizabeth
from our history profs, mebbe!

THIS is going to make a rather [
embarrassing situation for us. At the
beginning of last quarter we went
to great lengths in explaining to the
Father just why it was that the cost
of text books had risen, and etc. . . [

During his last eight years there he
was Dean of the Law school.

Since 1916 Mr. Woodward has
been professor of law at the Univer-
sity. For two years during the
World war he was in Washington
where he worked in the food admin-
istration and later Major Judge ad-
vocate, assigned to duty in the office
of the Provost Marshal General.

Prof. Tufts has been a member
of the faculty of the University since
its first year. He obtained his degree
of Ph. D. from the University of
Freiburg in 1892, and came to Chi-
cago in that same year. Tn 1905 he
was made head of the Department of
Philosophy, and in 1923 dean of fac-
ulties. In 1924 he was elected vice
president in addition to his other
duties.

At this juncture it would be proper
we believe, to revive that old story
of our campus life concerning the
Dean who held aloft a dollar bill in
his hand and walked down the street
singing, “Wave the Flag of Old Chi-
cago.”

Hannibal Hamlin EXCLUSIVELY
for THIS column) was wan and
drawn after the vicissitudes of the
day. He was but a wreck of the
hearty soul who had bravely begun
the day—pale, tottering, a feeble
shadow, his own mother would have
had difficulty in recognizing him.
His hand shook pitifully as he
reached for a cigarette. “You may
quote me as saying,” he began in his
feeble voice, “that I am through with
politics. It was only at the insistence
of my supporters that I consented to
carry the independent standard in
this race. I was, from the first, op-
posed to running, but I gave up
thoughts of self for that greater
cause of justice and right, but I ac-
quiesced to the desires of my follow-
ers only after some struggle and

considerable misgivings. Well, it is
all over now, and I have nothing but
heartiest congratulations to offer my
successful opponent. No, I shall not
demand a recount.” Exhausted with
the effort, he slumped down into his
chair, his unseeing eyes gazing far
off into space.

I

to Your Future

NOW

Your college education has opened the world of

I	opportuni v before ”

of choice than a non-college man. The path you
now choose will determine whether great success,
moderate success or failure await you.

It is now time to look to your future—it is now
time to decide on the path you wish to follow.

Before you decide—be deliberate. For which pro-
fession are you best fitted?

Business is undoubtedly the most fertile field for
men beginning their careers, because it offers count-
less opportunities for success.

The S. S. Kresge Company is seeking men of am-
bition and commercial ability to become store man-
agers. The requirements are loyalty, good moral
character, personality and hard work, and the op-
portunity is a position of trust and responsibility
where promotion is based entirely upon demon-
strated ability.

If you are interested enough to write us, we shall be
pleased to send you complete details and also to
arrange for an interview.
