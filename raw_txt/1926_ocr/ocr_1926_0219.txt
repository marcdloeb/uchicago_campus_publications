CODIFIES P. C.
REQUIREMENTS

Explain Gymnasium Requis-
ites In Statement, Clarify
Students* Impressions

See page 5 for full text of physi-
cal culture requirements.

Physical culture requirements
have been codified in a definite
statement which was adopted by the
Board of the Colleges and made pub-
lic yesterday. It contains an explana-
tion of the reasons for this requisite
for graduation and a clear statement
of the part which is expected of both
students and administration.

The administrative control of phy-
sical culture found its place in com-
pelling students to enroll for gym-
nasium work as a health measure,
and also in saving the students from
neglecting a prerequisite for a de-
gree. The statement contains the fol-
lowing points:

The grading system of the physi-
cal culture departments prohibits an
instructor from giving a grade be-
low’C owing to a students lack of
special skill or proficiency.

Probation For “F” or Two “D’s”

Mid-quarter marks denoting defi-
ciency in physical culture alone will
not make a student ineligible for
public appearance, but will be in-
cluded with the grades reported in
other courses to form a basis for
conceding or denying this privilege.

Students will be placed on proba-
tion for deficiency in physical cul-
ture upon receiving an F or two suc-
cessive D’s in gymnasium work.

Dropping a course in the depart-
ment will be permitted if the stu-
dent owing to illness ha.-, nd at-
tended classes for the minimum num-
ber of days required for a grade of
C or better. In this manner a fail-

ure will not be recorded.

Federation Issues Statement

The Council of the federation of
University Women, as a result of
criticism directed toward the wom-
en’s Department of Physical Cul-
ture, has suggested that the students
inspect the attendance and class rec-
ords of the instructors which are al-
ways open to them.

TALIAFERRO LEADS
MALA VIA CRUSADE
TO HONDURAS CAMP

An Expedition, headed by Dr. Wil-
liam Hay Taliaferro, associate profes-
sor of parasitology, will soon embark
for Central America to make a sero-
logical study of malaria. This will
be done in view to find a more accur-
ate diagnostic test of malaria than is
known at present.

The party will make its headquart-
ers at one of the camps of the United
Fruit Company in the heart of Hon-
duras. It will leave Chicago early in
the Spring quarter and will remain
away for about three months.

This research on malaria is a con-
tribution of work that has been going
on in the Department of Hygiene and
Bacteriology for a long time. It is
being supported by the International
Health Board, which is interested in
the control of such diseases as malaria,
hokoworm, and yellow fever.

Dr. Taliaferro will be accompanied
by Mrs. Taliaferro and Miss Anna B.
Fisher, both of whom are studying
malaria.

This expedition is one of several
planned by the University faculty in
the interests of human welfare and
science.

for Frosh Today
in Reynolds Today

A tea dance for freshmen men and
women will be held today from 4 to 6
in the Reynolds clubhouse. This dance
is the third function which the Fresh-
man class council has sponsored, the
other affairs having been an all-fresh-
man mixer held in the Reynolds club
and a banquet in Hutchinson Com-
mons.

The council expects about two hun-
dred people to attend the mixer.
Rainey Bennett, who is in charge o:
the music, promises that the guests
will be entertained. The class council
has invited Dean Edith Foster Flint.
Mr. and Mrs. Merle Coulter, of the
Botany department, and Mr. Anderson
to be hosts and hostesses at the dance.

“This mixer,’’ said Bennett, ‘is
for the age old purpose of binding
the class together.

PARKJSEES NEW
PRIDE IN NEGRO

Sociologist Discusses Race
Consciousness Over Radio

That the American negro has be
come thoroughly race conscious and
international in his sympathies was
the burden of Dr. Robert E. Park's
lecture from the Mitchell Tower sta-
tion last night. Dr. Park is a mem-
ber of the University department oi
sociology. His title was, “Negro
Race Consciousness."

“He is seeking alliances and creat
ing loyalties that transcend the bound
aries of our American common
wealth," Dr. Park asserted. “The
n gro is at least an internationalist
in his race relationships. He is be-
coming a citizen of the world."

Cite Negro Folk Songs

The speaker cited the negro spirit-
uals and folk songs as evidence of an
other worldly attitude during the pe-
riod of slavery. With a minimum of
happiness in his daily life, he dreamed
of a brighter world across the Jordan.

At last continued opposition an I
prejudice have combined to develop
in the negro of today a profound race
consciousness and race pride, accord
ing to Dr. Park. This attitude is re
fleeted in contemporary negro litera-
ture, which is highly colored by synic
ism and radical thought.

Dr. Park anticipated a reaction
against the present conditions, for
“better social conditions and less pre-
judice are bound to result in a less
savage outlook on the rest of human-
ity.”

“Orphans of the Storm, ” Or How
Phoenix Salesgirl Proves Heroine

By R. Harper

Battling on in the teeth of the bliz-
zard, the brave little figure seemd on
the verge of exhaustion. The howling
wind buffeted her with tearing, pierc-
ing blasts: the sleet beat down upon
her with a vengeful intentness. Yet,
as she passed us. there drifted back
through the howl of the blast, those
immortal words “Excelsior, Excel-
sior!’’ Surely, we thought, the girl
cannot be a Big Hay and Feed Man’s
daughter. But then it dawned on us
that the dauntless little girl was quot-
ing those resounding words that bore
the simple youth to his mountain top,
and we marveled at her courage.

What great motive must she have,
we continued to cogitate, to bring this
sheltered child out to battle with the

SPECIAL MUSIC

IN PRODUCTION

Students Compose Music and
Lyrics; Secure Two

Orchestras

Musical numbers and lyrics written
by students of the University will be
played by two orchestras at the First
Annual Mirror to be held March 5 and
6. Selections to be played by the or-
chestra were written by Jeanne De La-
marter, Clyde Keutzer, Alan Irwin.
John Lawer, Carl Lillie, and John
Wilde. Lyrics that will be sung by the
chorus accompanied by the orchestra
were composed by Margaret Emily
Carr, Bertha Ten Eyck James, Nancy
McMunn, and Dan Rich.

Women Play From Stage

A six piece men’s orchestra will be
in the pit to accompany the chorus
while an eleven piece women’s orches-
tra will play selections from the stage.
The women’s orchestra under the di-
rection of Marie Lewis, saxophonist,
will consist of two ukeleles, two ban-
jos, one saxophone and a piano. Ac-
cording to Miriam Walker, publicity
manager of Mirror, the orchestras
secured are unusually fine and will add
considerable to the performance.

Broadcast Lyrics

These original numbers played by
the two orchestras and solo selections
will be broadcast from KYW during
the week preceding the First .Annual
Mirror.

Religious Groups

Hold First Joint

Meeting Tonight

All denominational clubs on campus
will hold a joint meeting tonight at
7:30 in Ida Noyes theater, in conjunc-
tion wtih the all-campus Open Club

campaign. An address by Prof. F. R.
Moulton on "Recent Explorations in
Time and Spice” will form the princi-
pal part of the program.

This general meeting has been ar-
ranged for the purpose of helping stu-
dents to get in touch with the reli-
gious organization of their own de-
nomination. The following clubs and
groups will participate in the meeting:
the Baptist club, the Congregational
club, St. Marks (Episcopal) society,
the Lutheran club. Methodist group,
and the Westminster (Presbyterian!
club.

Aside from being a part of the Open
Club Week program, this meeting will
also be following the plan outlined by
the recent Student Conference at
Evanston.

crisis is she on her way to decide, or

with our newspaper mind, the head-
lines—"Brave Girl Saves Thousands
of Lives (or Dollars, or what have
wou).” “Courageous Miss Elsa
Gurgles Sacrifices Own Life to Avert
Tragedy.’’ But in the midst of our
horrified celebrations, We perceived
that the snow-covered one had turned
back, was even now approaching us
as we stood in the shelter of the flag-
pole. She speaks! "Buy a Phoenix,
Mister?”

We are convalescing very nicely,
thank you. And furthermore, we
have bought a Phoenix, and further-
more, Fred Handschy wishes us to
tell you that the whole sales force is
going to be on duty tomorrow morn-
ing, and that you can get one then,—

A Grain of Salt

Should you have the luck to go to
Europe this summer, and should you
take passage aboard the S. S. Amer-
ican Banker, you will see him. He
will be writing in the ship’s log, or
looking over the stores and cargos,
or paying off the crew. Or (because
true to tradition, he is doing the
Work of two men) he will be stand-
ing lookout duty on the focsle head,
or painting, or taking a turn at the
wheel.

bor, Leslie River, Ph. B.; but the
salty supernomen of Yeoman sup-

CHURCH CLUBS

HEAR MOULTON

Hold Joint Meeting—Tonight
In Ida Noyes

Prof. F. R. Moulton will be the
■peaker who will address the Denomi-
national clubs at their joint meeting
in Ida Noyes treatre tonight at 7:30.
The subject he has chosen is "Recent
Explorations in Time and Space.’

The meeting is being staged as a
part of the Open Club campaign in
accordance with the wish of the deans
to enroll every student in an activity.
Its purpose is not only to bring to-
gether not only the members of the
different clubs, but also to attract
prospective members.

This will be the first time that all
eight of the clubs will have met to-
gether. The meeting is open to all
students of the University as well as
to the public in general. Refresh-
ments will be served.

The open Club campaign was en-
dorsed by Dean Ernest Hatch Wil-
kins during his hospital internment.
The first function of the movement
was arranged by Chauncey Boucher,
Acting Dean of the Colleges.

CHOOSE QUEEN OF
BEAUTY TO PRESIDE
AT SPANISH FIESTA

A queen of beauty and costume
will be chosen at the Spanish Fiesta
which will be held Saturday, March
6 in Ida Noyes hall under the au-
spices of El Circulo Espanol. A
grand march, led by Yolanda Simiz
and Richard Kern will open the fes-
tivities, following which the girl with
the prettiest costume will.be selected
queen.

Consul Lupean of Mexico and
Consul de la Cruz of Spain will be
the guests of honor. The theatre of
Ida Noyes hall, the scene of the
dance, will be decorated in vivid
Spanish colors and a specially tango
with help reproduce the true atmo-
sphere of Spain. Unusual Spanish
refreshments will be served between
the dances.

“We want it to be understood that
this dance will not be a glorified
Spanish Club meeting,** Miss' Simiz
said. “No knowledge of Spanish will
be necessary to enjoy the evening,
but we urge all those, who can do
so, to wear Spanish costumes, in or-
der to be in keeping with the atmo-
sphere.”

The bids are two dollars and will
be placed on sale next week.

After the storm of protest that
was raised against the Prom Com-
mittee’s letter against drinking, the
Prom leaders declare that they do
not anticipate any trouble from this
source at the Washington Prom to-
night.

They have assumed that public
opinion, as expressed in these pro-
tests, is sufficiently strong to control
the situation without any further
action on the part of the committee.

As there has never been any
trouble in former years at occasions
of this kind the expectation is that
there will be no drinking tonight.
The leaders, though they have not
removed their threat of expulsion
for any who may become intoxivat-
ed, have ceased to regard the liquor
situation as a problem.

Fraternity leaders expressed sur-
prise and chagrin yesterday that they
should have been singled out as the
drinking element on the campus.
“We feel that such a warning was
entirely unnecessary,” declared one
man, last night.

Honor Directress
of French House

Mlle. Dorcas Perrenoud, directress
of the French house of the University. I
was honored last night by a reception
given for her by L’Alliance Francaise
of Chicago in the Recital hall of the
Fine Arts building. M. Marcel Grand-
jany, a well known French harpist,
who appeared on the program of the
evening, was also a guest of the soci-
ety.

“This is a signal honor to Mlle.
Perrenoud,” said Edward Ames, presi-
dent of Le Cercle Francaise of the
University. “The reception was given
in recognition of her excellent work
here at the University and in the
various French clubs and societies of
the city with which she has been asso-
ciated”

By Stewart McMullen

For the first time in the history
of Washington Promenades, the an-
nual formal is to be broadcast. Sta-
tion WMAQ is making special ar-
rangements with the South Shore
Country club where the affair will
be held tonight, to radiocast the his-
toric dance.

As the three hundred and fifty
couples that will be admitted throng
the salons of the south side club at
the thirty-second winter Prom, con-
tinuous music will play in the ball
room.

Try To Extend Time

Although the time has been an-
nounced as from 9 to 1, the leaders
are still endeavoring to overcome
the objections of the officials of the
for any who may become intoxicat-
the affair will be held, and extend
the time to 2.

The Prom leaders declare that ev-
erything is ready. The last decora-
tion has been put in its place and
the last attendant assigned to his
post. Everything awaits the start.

Both Orchestras Ready

The Prom’s two orchestras, that
promise continuous music during the
evening are ready and waiting.
“Husk" O’Hare has dug up his bag
of trick hats to aid him in leading
his Casino club orchestra to greater
heights of syncopation; and Ralph
Williams is neglecting his work in
recording for the Victor company to
prepare his men for the hop.

Photographers from the leading
papers in the city, two morning and
four evening dailies, will be on hand
to carry some of the merriment away
for their papers.

Issue Special Maroon

The Daily Maroon, as it has done
as far back as the oldest professor
on the faculty can remember, is issu-
ing its special Prom Maroon. The
issue will be under each plate at
the midnight supper.

Supper will be served between 11:30
and 12. The menu, as announced by
the Prom leaders, is as follows:

Tonight’s Menu

Chicken, Tolousaine

Lettuce, Thousand Island Dressing
Ice Cream Cake

The leaders of the Grand March, a?
selected by the Undergraduate Council
earlier in the year, are: Right wing,
Paul Cullom and Lucy Lamon; left
wing, Graham Kernwein and Cath-
erine Campbell. They have all de-

to believe that the annual hop will
be a great success.

ADD AMERICANA

X JOBLE attempt to interpret a present-day dance from the moral
’ point of view, by the editor of The Green and White of Ohio
University:

Recently one of our large nothern cities took a distinct
forward step in banning the “Charleston.’’ The action has
brought hisses from some of the younger generation, and
loud commendations from the older and more conserva-
tive element in the city. One of the older established col-
leges of the east has barred the dance, branding it as sug-
gestive and indecent. Other institutions are frowning
upon this convulsive wriggle, that passes in disguise under
the smooth name of the ‘‘Charleston” as a modern dance.

If the “Charleston” is representative of the youth of this
country, then this generation of young men and women
must from necessity accept the criticism that the world is
heaping upon it. But if the American college student can
be blamed for accepting the dance, he cannot be accused
as being the originators. Blame rather some loose-footed
colored syncopator. who, in one of the low dives in the
colored section of New Orleans, originated the step that
has swept its way into our cities and universities.

It is gratifying to see that at most of the school functions
at Ohio, only a few attempt the “Charleston.”

^HAT is the matter with our col-
leges? From time to time—and
increasingly—the public prints are
devoting their columns to discussions
of this question. Partly as cause,
partly as the result of these discus-
sions, there has been an increase of
public interest in the matter, there
has arisen among undergraduates a
critical, challenging attitude toward
their schools; and finally, there have
been significant experiments made
by able educators which promise to
revolutionize the American system
of higher education.

While it is true that colleges have
been subjected in the past to no in-
considerate amount of criticism the
current uproar over colleges and
their shortcomings is ,'ouder and
more general than ever before. Per-
haps the highest pitched of the
noises are those made by the inde-
fatigable Mr. Mencken, who never
loses an opportunity to castigate col-
leges and college faculties. His com-
ment and the more significant com-
ment of the nation’s periodicals, both
popular and learned, indicate that
the recent spread of higher educa-
tion has been accompanied by a de-
crease in the general respect for that
education.

J^EROGATORY comment in news-
papers and books of fiction has
been profuse, but in the main limited
to charges of immorality among col-
legians, and criticism of their more
trivial and “newsy” defects. As for
immorality the charges have been
mostly false or exaggerated. Dr.
Charles Selden, in a series of articles
published in the Ladies Home Jour-
nal, describes his investigations at
eight leading American universities
and effectively refutes these attacks.
His article on morals at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, in the February edi-
tion of the Journal, is a reasonably
accurate survey of the situation and
is full of praise for the high moral
standards prevailing at the univer-
sity.

More accurate and more penetrat-
ing have been the criticisms made by
sober, capable educators:

ILDING the lily, as conceived by the reporter who wrote the
buy-a-Phoenix story in yesterday’s Maroon:

The sketches which accompany the drawings were done

by Allen Heald.

“/ ’OLLEGE education is chiefly
notable for its ineffectiveness.”
"A training school for shamming
and shirking. The most gigantic il-
lusion of the age.”

“Many a youth comes of age and
is graduated from college with a
man’s body and a boy’s mind.”

“The college boy is not educated,
he does not want to be educated; but
only to make his letter, his clubs, and
in due season to graduate.”

“Our college students are and for
the most part emerge flighty, super-
ficial and immature, lacking as a
class concentration, seriousness and
thoroughness.”

These quotations from eminent
scholars and educators indicate that
our college faculties are alive to the
inadequacy of the intellectual train-
ing given in the liberal colleges.
What they are doing about it, their
plans and their experiments, will be
described in further articles to fol-
low.

would have made bearable an ordinary

evening. The supper, I just know,
, will take hours to serve and so pro

to each other that they want o leave,

JOHN Allison tells us that the
i A. T. O.’s have not as yet laid hands
on the burglar who ransacked their
house last week. We sympathize with
j him deply. But we cannot help recall-
j ing the incident of a burglar who was
| caught with a bag of purloined frater-
| nity silverware. “Well.” asked the
cop. “What shall we do with the
silverware?”

Here Is the Complete Text of
Physical Culture Requirements

A DEGREE REQUIREMENT

For a number years it has been tue
almost universal practice of the col-
leges and universities of this coun-
try to require, as a health measure,
a certain amount of physical culture,
in addition to a given amount of ac-
ademic work, for the bachelor’s de-
gree. To serve its purpose as a health
measure, the physical culture require-
ment should be fulfilled during the
first two years of academic work, and
should be met by the student in a
spirit of willingness to co-operate.

Though physical culture is needed
for health’s sake during the last two
years as well as during the first two
years of college, it has been required
only during the first two years in the
belief that most students will then
have seen the need of regular exercise,
will have formed the habit of taking
exercise regularly, and will take pro-
per physical care of themselves there-
after.

Carelessness Not General

A great majority of the students in
the Junior College have met the re-
quirement both at the proper time and
in the proper spirit. But experience;
has shown that in a few instances, due
either to carelessness or a deliberate
attempt to evade the physical culture
requirement, the result was that, in
the absence of effective administrative
efforts, the work was not taken when
it should have been; the student was
allowed to fulfill the academic require-
ments for graduation without meeting
the physical culture requirement at
the proper time, and was seriously dis-
appointed when not allowed to take
his degree at the normal time. Hence
the conclusion seemed inevitable that
administrative measures were needed
on at least two grounds: first, to sec
that the physical culture requirement
was met at the time when needed to
serve as a health measure—in the first
two years of academic work; and sec-
ondly, to protect the student, in same
cases, against his own carelessness in
not meeting one of the degree require-
mets before it was too late to do so
without serious delay and inconveni-
ence.

Tn the interest of effective adminis-
tration of this degree requirement,
adopted are retained as a health meas-
ure, the following regulations are pub-
lished for the information of all con-
cerned.

REGISTRATION

All Junior College students are re-
quired to take physical culture. Senior
College students who failed to receive
full credit for physical culture in the
Junior College must take physical cul-
ture continuously until they have six
quarters’ credit with an average of ^.
Tn the School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration, however, students over
twenty-two years of age are exempt
from the physical culture requirement.

Students must report to Miss Dud
ley’s office in Ida Noyes Hall or to
Dr. Reed’s office in Bartlett Gymna-
sium during the first three days of the
quarter for an assignment to classes,
unless such assignment has been made
at the close of the preceding quarter.

EXEMPTION AND ABSENCES

Applications for exemption from the
requirement or for modification of it
will be considered after the second
week of the quarter. All application®
for exemption, excuses for absences,
etc., must be presented, for women,
at the Director’s office in Ida Noyes
Hall; for men, at the Director’s office
in Bartlett Gymnasium. Students can
be excused from physical culture only
by Miss Dudley or Dr. Reed. Such
excuse should be obtained the first
week of a quarter, and covers that
quarter only.

Absences from physical culture
classes caused by illness which pre-
vents the keeping of other University
appointments may be excused if ap-
plication is made within one week
after the student resumes work. A
certificate from a University medical
adviser or an attending physician
shpuld be presented.

GRADES, ELIGIBILITY, PROBA-

TION, AND SUSPENSION

No degrees of skill or proficiency is
insisted for a grade of C. No student
will be given a grade of D or F be-
cause of lack of skill or proifciency.

If a grade of D is recorded for the
work of any quarter, the student must
make at least a grade of B in a sub-
sequent quarter tp bring his average
up to C and to count tie quarter for
which a D was recorded as one of th*
six required quarters.

If a grade of D is received for the
work of one quarter, and in the other
five quarters no grade higher than C
is recorded, the student must attain a
grade of C in an extra quarter’s work.

“F” Not Counted

The grade of F is not counted in
reckoning the average grade of C for
six quarters to complete the physical
culture requirement; if a student has
one or more grades of F and six
grades of C, the requirement is ful-
filled.

Rules governing eligibility as af-
fected by academic and physical cul-
ture records are made by the Board
of the Colleges and not by the De-
partments of Physical Culture. The
health rules on eligibility are made
by the Medical Board and not by the
Departments of Physical Culture

Give Mid-Term Reports

Mid-term reports of unsatisfactory
work in physical culture will be treated
the same 'as, and along with, reports
on academic courses. A mid-term re-
port of D in physical culture alone will
not make a student ineligible for pub-
lic appearance. A student reported at
the middle of the quarter as having F
in one course, either physical culture
or any academic course, or D in two or
more courses, inclusive or exclusive of
physical culture, is ineligible for the
remainder of the quarter.

A student receiving an F or two
sucessive D’s in physical culture will
be placed on probation for deficiency
in physical culture. A student does
not have to maintain a C average in
physical culture to be off probation.
A student on probation because of a
delinquency in physical culture will
be removed from probation after com-
pleting a quarter’s work with a grade
of C or better, or at the end of the
quarter at the beginning of which he
may have been excused.

Penalty for Negligence

Failure to secure credit with a grade
of C or better at the end of the proba-
tion quarter, or failure to obtain an
excuse from physical culture during
the first two weeks of that quarter,
renders the student liable to suspen-
sion from the University for one quar-
ter. A second suspension renders the
student liable to dismissal from the
University.

If, because of illness, or for some
other reason which may be considered
satisfactory by the director of the De-
partment, a student may be in at-
tendance in any quarter less than the
minimum amount required for a grade
of C or better, the student, on the
recommendation of the Director, may
be reported as having dropped the
course and thus avoid having a grade
of F recorded. Tn such case the stu-
dent is not put on probation the fol-
lowing quarter, for the course is not
counted as a course taken, though the
student may not be relieved of the
obligation to make it up in a subse-
quent quarter.

Physical culture may be deferred in
rare and very exceptional cases when
recommended by the Director and ap-
proved by the Dean.

DEPARTMENT POLICY IN
GRADING

For the information of those con-
cerned, the two Departments of Phy-
sical Culture have joined in making
the following statement regarding
their policies in grading:

“Giving grades for Physical Culture
doubtless seems improper to some. To
the Department it has seemed consist-
ent with general University practice
and also a fair stimulus toward doing
better than mere ‘passing’ work in the
Department, rhe faculty was suffi-
ciently in sympathy with this view to
authorize the giving of such grades
and it is understood that the student
body is interested in the basis for
grading in this department. Hence
this statement.

“Perhaps it should be remarked in
a preliminary way that the Depart-
ment is mainly engaged in conducting
activities which involve exercise but
no preparation. If a student is to gain
whatever benefits there are in these
activities he must be present at the
class and take the exercise. What fie
does is more important than what he
knows. These facts make for a great-
er emphasis on attendance than in
other departments.

Consider Five Factors

“In assigning grades in Physical
Culture the instructors try to consider
the following five factors: (1) Attitude
or co-operation; (2) Effort pr earnest-
ness; (?) Tmprmrement; (4) Arrnm.l
plishment; (5) Attendance.	■

“In general a grade of A will be
given only to students who are excel-
lent in all these regards. One of great
natural ability and excellent perform-
ance may therefore fail to attain the
highest grade because, in the opinion
of the instructor, he does not approx-
imaet his best through lack of effort
or faithful attendance. One who is
physically handicapped so that his per-
formance can never be of the best
may still receive a grade of B for ex-

All seats free. Visitors cordially welcome.

cellence in the other regards. All un-
excused absences affect the grade un-
favorably, just as faithful attendance
affects it favorably. An excessive
number of absences excused because
of illness may, upon recommendation
of the instructor, cause the course to
be regarded as dropped or deferred
with no grade given on the theory that
the student who is present at but two-
thirds of the class meeings, for ex-
ample, does not deserve the same I

credit as the one who is present at
practicaly all, even though he has good
cause for his absences.

“Obviously such a method of grac-
ing is more difficult to administer
fairly than the one in use in other de-
partments since the standards cannot
be perfectly definite as much must be
left to the judgment of the instructor,
and yet it might be urged with some
success that it is educaionally sound
in a broad sense.”

LOCAL CAGEMEN
ENGAGE ILLINOIS

IN RETURN GAME

Clash at Urbana Monday
Eve; Hard Struggle

Predicted

Inspired with confidence as a result
of their clean cut victory over the
powerful Boilermakers, Norgren’s
basketeers now have an excellent
chance to finish their last three games
of the season with triumphs. With
this in mind the eagers resumed prac-
tice in preparation for the game with
the Illini on Monday night.

Maroons Have Edge

Chicago rejoices in destroying title
hopes and since the downstaters are
temporary championship contenders,
the Maroons should win. In their last
meeting the Mid way it es annexed a
19 to 14 win, but with court floors re-.
versed Ruby’s men have a mure than
even chance to win. The Illinois five
has shown tremendous improvement
in its last two starts, defeating Purdue
and Ohio. With Haines and Kassel
at the guards, Martin at center, and
Pug Daugherty and Maurer at for-
word, the Orange and Gold have a
combination that is the equal of any
Big Ten outfit, every man being a
veteran.

As for the Maroons, they have ev-
erything to gain and nothing to lose.
Alyea showed that he has regained his
eye for the basket and should the
tricky Jayhawker star get going with
his weird one handed shots, it bodes
ill for the opposition. Zimmerman
and Sackett are playing strong games
at forward while McDonough and
Hoerger are undoubtedly the toughest
guarding combination in the Big Ten.

Situation Tangled

It seems that the more games that
are played, the more entangled does
the Conference race become and the
more likely does it appear that there
will be no undisputed champ. A team
with an 8-4 record should tie for the
title. About all that remains to make
this season one of the most unpredict-
able in Conference history is for
Northwestern to win five straight and
annex the title. On the form displayed
last Monday night against the Bad-
gers, the Wildcats showed themselves
capable of doing just that. It is con-
ceivable for the Maroons with five
defeat? chalked up against them to
share# piece of the Big Ten flag if
the upsets continue, just possibly con-
ceivable!

WATER POLO SQUAD

ENGAGES WISCONSON

The polo team is also leaving for
the lake country of Wisconsin and is
threatening the Madison poloers with
a real water fight. Captain Petrolo-
witz’s crew, after feeling the stings
of defeat twice this year, have been
indulging in scrimmage for the past
few days and are considered in shape
to take on any of the teams, includ-
ing their victors of the last two
games.

Hall, of the goal tending crew,
has been dividing his time between
swimming breakstroke and guarding
the goal for the Varsity during
scrimmage tactics and is in real
shape for the trip. Gilchrist, Gordon,
Jelinek and Greenberg have also
shown up better this week and are
raring to go.

The contest should be replete with
thrills, as the Badger forces almost
always have a strong water squad.

“Sprad” Meets Behr
In Saturday Game

One of the big features of to-
morrow’s Big Ten cage game be-
tween Purdue and Wisconsin will
be the scoring duel between Behr
and Spradling. Spradling is at pre-
sent high point man of the confer-
ence, with seventy nine points in
his eight games to date.

This is an average of a fraction
less than ten points a game which
is very good, even in these days of
the lively ball. Behr has already
garnered a total of seventy three
points but he has competed In two
less games than the Lafayette ace,
which gives him a lead in the aver-
ages. “Sprads” chance to make an
all-time conference high point
record was given a severe jolt
Wednesday night when he was
held to two field goals by the
Maroons.

WHAT of IT?

LW'UIWMJIJJ^

The annual Washington Prom is
tonight, and seeing myself in the way
of doing a great and lasting service
to my fellow men, I do not shrink
from bringing upon my head the em-
nity of all womankind by coming out
unflinchingly against coursages for the
occasion. 1 suppose I shall be hooted
down in every center of feminine con-
gregation, or burned in effigy or some-
thing, yet I feel that the questio is too
big to allow mere consideration of
self to enter between me and duty.
So I stand on the platform on “No
Corsages!”

My action in this matter is all the
more noteworthy since I myself am
not going to the Prom, and do not
therefore have to buy one of those
things whose purchase I oppose. Even
now I hear the whispers going around,
from the one sex, "What right’s he
got meddling in matters that don’t
concern him?” and from the other,
The guy must be a nut, gettin' al! the
wimmin sore at him that way.” But I
disregard them all—I take my stand,
regardless alike of the opinion of
friend and foe.

When I voiced the attitude I was
going to take on corsages to that lead-
ing man-about-campus, Mr. Seward
Covert, he took my hand in his and
shook it very vigorously. “You may,”
said Mr. Covert, pumping my arm up
and down, “use my name in this mat-
ter. I admire your red-blooded stand.
I am, if I may for the noncedepart
from the strict usages of Mr. Cool-
idge's English, all for you. Yes, yes;
by all means, use my name in this
matter. It will carry weight,” said

Throes of
fridge Tournament

By George Gruskin

The “nth” Annual Inter-Greek
Bridge Tournament was inaugurated
last Friday, when John Howe of the
Intra-mural Department pressed a
button from the basement of Bart-
lett gym that lighted electric bulbs
in the parlors of thirty-two different
fraternity-houses, signalling th e
players to start their pastboard man-
ipulations.

Many Objections

When the proposal of such a con-
test was first put before the mem-
bers of the Inter-fraternity Council
years ago there was wide debate as
to whether or not such a step in
Fraternity “Athletics” would be con-
ducive to gambling. Many of the
people feared that there would be
an immediate tendency back to the
vices of the pool-room and poker
table if there was any relaxation of
the stern grip of the University on
Undergraduate morals, and that
therefore a bridge tournament was
to be avoided.

Finally Initiated

Others were of the opinion that
the mere fact that cards was a
gambling game should be enough to
blackball bridge from the schedules
of the athletic department. With the
assurance of several of the delegates
that with their fraternities in the
running the final outcome would not

NATATORS TRAVEL
TO BADGER CAMPUS

TONIGHT FOR MEET

After three unsuccessful out of
town attempts, the swim team is
traveling to the Badger campus to-
day with high hopes of cleaning
their smeared slate of this season.
The men are quite confident of their
strength after the times made in the
last few weeks and are eagerly look-
ing forward to a victorious return
Monday.

The dope sheets show up the Ma-
roon squad as the stronger of the
two dual meet entries and barring
the relay, dives and dashes, should
be able to cope with the speed of
the hosting team.

Wisconsin outswam Purdue just
lately and made remarkably fast
time in the four man relay event.
Herschberger is the main ground of
worry in the shorter swims, while
Wheatley and Simpkins are the lead-
ers in the diving contest. The Badg-
er divers placed in last year’s Con-
ference meet and have improved
considerably since, but with Felling-
er and Wilder trying to make up for
lost time, very close judging will
feature this part of the fray.

The Badger swimmers have been
hitting the four forty event at the
fast clip of 6 minutes two seconds,
which will call for Greenberg and
Lane’s best efforts to better.

Mygdal and Diamond will have a
much easier time in their event and
hope to annex respective firsts.

Captain Noyes has corrected his
few weaknesses in the past few days
and the watches timed him at be-
neath the twenty-second mark so
that Herschberger’s fins must do
some fast flapping to keep him in
the lead. Rittenhouse has been
spending all his stray time splashing
the hundred free style in less than
one minute and expects to touchoff
in the same time at the hostile pool.

Both Jelinek and Fellin ger are
now initiated into the trials in the
backstroke and stand a much better
show than before.

Yearling Swimmers
Name Oker Captain

Cornilius Oker, better known as
“Cornie’ to the swimming world,
was elected into the captaincy of
the Freshman swim crew yester-
day.

Cornie held the record for the
backstroke event in the high school
league and is also a diver of note.
He. tied the Conference record for
the forty yard crawl last quarter,
added strength to the relay teams
in the Freshman-Varsity struggle.

Coach MacGillivray was very
much pleased with the outcome of
yesterday’s election and considers
the new captain a fine leader as
well as an all around athlete. “In
Oker, the next year’s team has one
of the fastest sprint and backstroke
men in the Conference who will
without doubt be the main point
gainer in the dual meet opposition,”
says MacGillivray.

A. T. 0. OVERRUNS

BETA BASKETMEN

Despite the overdose of blizzard
weather on hand a remarkably large
crowd came to Bartlett last night to
view the last of the preliminary I.
M. Basket games. And their handi-
work was well rewarded, for every
one of the ten teams that played put
the best that they had in a final
spurt to win their way into next
week’s semi finals. The games were
all peppy and full of brilliant tac-
tics and many times the spectators
made the rafters wobble with appre-
ciative cheers for the good play.

A. T. O. Win.

The A. T. 0. super-team again
demonstrated their prowess and for-
shadowed a good fight for the title
by over-running the Beta men 43 to
8, thus keeping their reputation for
being a forty point a game team.
They have won all their last three
games by scores of forty and above.
The terrible trio, Anderson, Gordon,
and Cassie kept up their basket run-
ning policies and contributed 12, 14
and 12 points respectively. And
Murphy and Adams guarded so close-
ly that the Betas could only sink
three buckets—two by way of Mudge
and one via Place.

But the Betas turned the tables
in “B” league game and fought out
a 9 to 2 win over the A. T. O. min-
ors. Wood was practically the whole
team, looping in eight of their nine
points.

Exciting Tilt

The most exciting game of the five
scheduled, though, was the Phi Gam-
Alpha Delt fray. At the end the
Phi Gams were on top with the score
15 to 10 in their favor but it was
only their last minute efforts that
won. At half time the count was
tied up five to five. Just about then
Austy MacCarthy and Rolston come
to life—sank two efforts apiece and
put the game on ice for the winners.

Many Appointed
To Help Manage
Annual Contest

By Bill Weddell

A complete list of committeemen
who will take charge of the Intra-
mural Department’s Second Annual
Athletic Carnival, to be held on
Thursday evening, March 4th, was
issued today by Arnold Johnson, Stu-
dent Manager of the mammoth af-
fair.

Many Committee.

In order to produce the Carnival
on the tremendous scale outlined by
the department, a veritable regiment
of officials and assistants has been
selected to aid in handling the big
event.

Yesterday afternoon the chairmen
and their assistants were marshalled
together for a pep session before
turning them loose to prepare the
details for the largest evening in the
Intramural Department’s history.

Fraternity Representation . .

In order to secure the efficient co-
operation of the fraternities and the
women on campus, two committees
were chosen headed by Helen King
and Paul Lewis. The fraternities
committee under Paul Lewis will
have a representative from every se-
cret organization on the campus.

“The enthusiasm with which the
prospects of the meet has been re-
ceived by the Intramural workers
(Continued on page 2)

HANDBALL TOURNEY
STARTS WELL; CARD
EIGHT TILTS TODAY

Opening rounds of Intramural
Handball are now under way and
this sport is again threatening bas-
ketball as the most popular winter
offering on the Intramural program.
Almost every fraternity is represent-
ed this year, and the games so far
have been hard fought and well play-
ed.

Most of the teams which are on
today’s bill have had previous con-
tests, and should gain by that ex-
perience. The Alpha Delts, the
Sigma Nus, the Kappa Nus, and the
Tau Delts all have victories to their
credit and are slight favorites in
today’s battles.

Eight contests are booked for this
afternoon, fraternity doubles teams
being paired up for play on the open
courts at the West side of the sta-
dium.

Here are the pairings:

Alpha League

4:15—Alpha Sigma Phi vs. Alpha
Delta Phi

5:00—Lambda Chi Alpha vs. Beta
Theta Pi

Beta League

4:15—Delta Upsilon vs. Tau Delta
Phi

5:00—Kappa Nu vs. Tau Sigma Om-
icron

Gamma League

4:15—Sigma Nu vs. Delta Kappa
Epsilon '

5:00—Pi Lambda Phi vs. Phi Sigma
Delta

Delta League •
5:00—Kappa Sigma vs. Delta Chi
4:15—Phi Kappa Sigma vs. Kappa
Alpha Psi

Especially picked to win are the
Alpha Delts, who exhibited cham-
pionship form when they took two
straight sets from the dangerou^
Beta Theta Pi outfit in the opening
games last Wednesday afternoon.
Sigma Nu also looked well in winning
her initial contest from Pi Lambda
Phi by set scores of 21 to 13 and
21 to 3.

BADGERS, BUCKS,
MAROON, PURPLE
RUN TOMORROW

Staggmen Work Out; An-
Quadrangular Meet to

Draw Crowd

After going through a final stiff
workout yesterday in Bartlett gym
the track team will rest this after-
noon in preparation for the big an-
nual quadrangular meet which will
be held tomorrow. The teams com-
peting will be Wisconsin, Northwes-
tern, Ohio and Chicago. The local
tracksters last year obtained third
place in this meet but should cop a
higher position this year, due to a
better balanced team and also be-
cause some of the opponents are
weaker than last season. Wisconsin
looks to be the favorite to win the
event this year although the Badg-
ers are greatly weakened by the in-
eligibility of Schwartze, giant weight
man who was last year’s conference
sensation. However they are well
fortified in other departments hav-
ing McGiveran and McAndrews, star
sprinters, and McInnis, who holds the
meet record in the high jump, hav-
ing cleared the bar at six feet four
inches in a previous meet.

Relay Team Formed

Coach Stagg was hard at work
yesterday afternoon in an effort to
find a suitable relay combination.
Mickleberry, Beal, Armstrong, Met-
zenberg and Cusack all made very
good time and the first four mention-
ed will probably make up the team
so as to give Cusack ample rest for
the mile and half mile, his special-
ities.

With McKinney out of school and
Kernwein at present incapacitated
with a bad leg the team is hard
up for sprinters. Hobschied is put-
ting the shot in good form and has
an excellent chance to win this event
in the meet. Captain Jim Cusack
has almost entirely recovered from
the illness which was really the cause
of his losing two races in the Purdue
meet and should be good for a couple
firsts. Burg, the sophomore high
jumper and vaulter who has been
going so good will encounter some
real competition in McInnis, the car-
dinal star.

Ohio Strong

The Ohio State team lead by
Guthrie, one of the best hurdlers in
the conference, is also a strong con-
tender in the meet. Irwin, Kennedy,
and Arnold are all veterans who
have won their spurs in previous
years while Tooley and Brown are
fast coming sophomores who have
shown great promise.

JUNIOR WOMENARE
CAGE TILT WINNERS

The Juniors gained first place in the
inter-class championship race Wed-
nesday, Feb. 17, by defeating the
Seniors 22 to 12. Sophomores and
Seniors are tied for second place, and
the Freshmen come in last. It is prob-
able that the next games will see some
serious upsets, and that the Freshmen
will do some of the upsetting because
they have an exceptionally strong
team this year which is improving with
every game. It was only after a hard
fight that the Sophomore’s succeeded
in beating them 12 to 9 last Wednes-
day.

Several women shone as exceptional
players. Madi Bacon, captain of the
Junior team, is perhaps the best all-
round player in the tournament. She
made al! but two of the baskets for
her team, and is equally adept in de-
fensive work.

arm a final pump.

you aren’t going to wear one.” “That
may be so,” rejoined Mr. Davies, “but
just the same, I reiterate, am all for
them.”

“The corsage,” continued Mr. Cov-
ert, “is one of the banes of existence;
it is an irritation, a bother—any other
man but I would call it a damn nuis-
ance. I, however,” said Mr. Covers,
“do not go that far. I merely state
that corsages would be very much in
the way at the Washington Prom. Tn
my day,” he went on, “I have had
corsages crushed all over my dress

clothes.

I remember once.” he said.

looking as if the recollection were
painful. “I bought a corsage of violets.
I remember the corsage, but I forget
the girl. Well, sir, I noticed that
these violets were kind of wet..
’What’s that was on ’em,’ I asked the
florist. ‘That ain’t water,’ he replied,
‘that’s dew. We guarantee our dew
—it’s quite the thing to have a dewy
corsage.’ Well,” said Mr. Covert com-
ing out of his revery, “my weskit cer-
tainly was a mess that night."

“In all my opposition to corsages,"
continued Mr. Covert, “the monetary
consideration does not enter. 1 have
merely judged corsages in the balance,
and found them wanting. I am just
opposed to them on principle.’ Mr.
Bradley Davies entered into the dis-
cussion here. “I am for corsages,”
said Mr. Davies, “entirely for them.
I do not know why, but I am. 1
should look upon any attempt to bar
corsages from this year’s Washington
Prom with decided misfacor.” “I do
not see,” said Mr. Covert, clinking
some small change in his pocket to-
gether as he walked off. “what you've
got to butt in for. As far as I know.
