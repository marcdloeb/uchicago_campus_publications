been selected by Thomas Mulroy,
manager of this year’s meet, to head

members of the department.

The chief aim of the Order is ex-
clusiveness; and the invitation cere-
mony will consist of a horse precipi-
tating the rider from the saddle. In
order to qualify, a rider must be fully

“Catherine was one of the best
workers on the board of last year, and
we know that she can put the rush-

year. It is only with the utmost co-
operation of the campus women that
this meet will be a success, and we
think that she is fully capable of se-

Six prominent down town companies
will have employment representatives
on campus next week. By this ar-

he given an opportunity to interview
these men and learn of the respective

The Kresge department store, the
Reliance Realty association, the Bell

Securities company will be among
those who seek college trained men.

Representatives of the company may

THE University’s plans for attracting good students from the high

Friday, might be improved in several respects. Not enough under-
graduates meet the contestants; not enough food is served them; and
they do not remain on the quadrongles long enough.

It is believed that the Kalila and
Dimna stories originated in India
where they were fabricated by the wise
men to instruct the Indian princes in
the ways and wiles of government.
They were brought to Persia by a
learned doctor, and from the courts
of Persia about 500 A. D. they eman-
ated to all parts of the world and per-
meated its literature. It is said that
there are traces of these fables in the
literature of about thirty-eight differ-

children’s stories broadcasted nightly
by radio are adapted from thc early

NCE, many, many years ago when we were just a freshman, we
told by fraternity brothers (who really ought to know) that it

was a nice thing to do of a Friday night (or a Saturday night,—
the case might be) to drop in on the boys of the other fraternities
who were giving parties. It wsa pointed out to us at the time that it
was especially nice to do this when our fraternity was also giving a
party, but that it was all right at any time.

Well, like the big, green boy that we were, we did this...............
with a girl and everything. And when we got there . . . well, no-
body paid any attention to us, except once when somebody ran into
us( we and our girl) and accepted our apology, and once when
a kindly old alumnus of their chapter asked our name, and upon
telling him, told us that he was glad to meet the new brothers.

Well, we didn’t go to any more fraternity houses while they,
were having parties until last Friday night, and then we took our
life in our hands and tried it. And with what result? Why, every-
body was nice to us; they smiled at us; they introduced their girls
to us; they presented us to the chaperones; they gave us some punch;
and when we were ready to go, they said good-night to us.

Now, we haven’t grown any better looking in two years; neith-
er have we bought a new car. But why this pleasantry?

Evidently Fraternity men at last beginning to realize what it’s
all about,—what the essential purpose of fraternity life is. They are
evidently beginning to see the real power of cordiality. They seem
to be beginning to understand that the best way in which to create
a friendly spirit among their classmates and fellow-students, and inci-
dentally to boost their fraternity in the eyes of others, is to encour-
age this visiting of parties, and reciprocate with cordiality to visitors.

There is a cycle of fashion
not only for the hats col-
lege men wear but for the
line of work into which
they go.

But your job has to fit
your head as well as your
nat, for it has to fit your
state of mind.

Like your hat also, your
job needs to fit your purse.
Therefore, why not choose
one that brings not only
satisfaction in service but
in financial return.

Selling life insurance isone
of the few modern busi-
nesses that does just this.

It takes:

Intelligence, Zest
and Ability

It gives:

philosophic satisfaction of
selling future security and
present serenity to living
people, and a response, im-
mediate and tangible, in
monetary as well as mental
reward.

Never realized till today that the little row of our own
books on my desk could do as much for me as those
miraculous 5-foot shelves ’ that fortify one against all
social crises in 1 5 minutes daily reading * * * The next
time I m snowed in by one of Chicago's blizzards I'll
only have to reach across my desk to get a book that
will satisfy most any intellectual craving. * * *

If it’s a shorty story I want there’s Ryder’s “The Pan-
chatantra’' with its glamorous tales from India * * *
If I want to know about the Orient of today there are
three volumes of the Harris lectures by men who are
Oriental either by birth or adoption * * * If jf8
modern business John Maurice Clark’s “The Socail Con-
trol of Business” is now and worth any snowbound read-
er’s time * * *

If my mood is religious I may browse in the New Testa-
ment as Edgar J. Godspeed has translated it, read Dr.
Gilkey’s sermons, “Jesus and Our Generation,” or let
Kenneth Saunders tell me about “Epochs in Buddhist
History” * * *

What’s what in art is available for me in Pennell’s “The

Frank Pitches Three Hit
Game for Pi

Lams

Of the five sanies scheduled yester-
day. three were played. I’hi 1’si for-
feited to Psi U. and Alpha Sig for-
feited to Alpha Delt. The victors in
the three games played were Pi
Lambda Phi .who blanked the Dekes,
Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kappa Xu.

Pi Lam Wins Duel

In the best game of the day. Pi
Lambda Phi out hit and outplayed the
strong D. K. E. aggregation and
blanked them all the way through. 4-0.
Jus Frank, pitching for the Pi Lams,
hurled a sweet game, keeping the los-
ers down to three hits, all scattered.

When he got in the hole several
limes, his teammates pulled him out
by shoestring catches and double plays
performed by "Bunny" Keefer at sec-
on<L Several times the Dekes threat
ened to score, but each time were set
down without a counter to their credit

After playing two scoreless innings,
the Pi Lams through three clean hits
and an error, took the lead with three
runs. In this frame Shlaes scored from
first an an overthrow, while stealing
second. They counted another run in
the sixth and held the losers scoreless
in the last frame to win.

Phi Gam Trails

The Phi Gam trailed the Alpha Ep
bunch all the way through, never seri-
ously threatening them until the last
frame, when they nicked Diamond for
three runs. Johnny Bartlett pitched
for the losers, while the said Diamond
hurled for tin- winners.

A double play. Durchstag to Dia-
mond to Weiss, was the feature of
the fourth inning. Both pitchers were
hit rather freely. "Hub" Parker hit
well for the Phi Gams while Spear
hit every inning for the winners. The
score was 7-4 in favor of the Alpha
Eps.

Except for two innings, Merrill,
Delta Chi hurler, held the Kappa Xu
squad scoreless. But in those two
frames, the third and fourth. Kappa
Nu piled up all their runs and was
never headed. The Delta Chi aggre-
gation stepped out in the initial inn-
ing with a two run gain, but didn’t
score after that and lost by the score
of 9-2. The big innings for the Kap-
pa Nus came in the third, when they
counted five and in the next after
that, when they added four to their to-
tal, making their nine.

Begin Net Doubles

Meet This Thursday

The tennis doubles tournament will
begin Thursday of this week and
eight games will be played daily un-
til the end of the month. There are
forty-three teams entered and they
have been formed into six leagues, five
fraternity and one non fraternity.

The games will be played on the re-
served courts at 60th and Kenwood,
and must be played on the day sched-
uled or counted as a forfeit. Post-
ponements will be discouraged because
of the limited time to complete the
league schedule.

This year’s entries are unusually
large and in some instances it will be
necessary for a team to play on two
consecutive days.

Ten Teams Battle

With play ground ball well on its
way, and the sun smiling down on
the players with lukewarm rays, a
few more games will be taken care
of by the time night takes control

WHAT o/ IT?

ygOl^i MORGENSTERN

Until yesterday morning our frat-
ernity house had a dog. This might
not seem strange had you never seen
the animal, but if through some chance
you did see him. it would seem very,
very strange. The fact that he was
tolerated, even esteemed somewhat, by
the brothers appears, however, to have
made no impression upon him. In-
stead of being grateful for such con-
sideration (meriting, as he did. so
little on either his looks or actions),
he has folded his tents and gone with
the winds, and. possibly, more dogs,
from whom he will probably catch
fleas and other things.

The dog first made his appearance
Sunday night, when he followed Babe
Alyea home under cover of darkness.
Mr. Alyea observed that it was a
dog that was accompanying him and,
having a kindly heart, he made little
resistance when the beast began to
wedge himself in the door of the
house along with him. Until the
lights were turned on. however. Mr.
Alyea had no conception of what the
dog looked like. But when the ani-
mal was seen it was little wonder that
Mr. Alyea broke out with the ejacula-
tion, “Hah-"

It is no exaggeration to say that
the dog presented a most peculiar ap-
pearance. He was, in the first place,
built upon squat, horizontal lines,
without a good deal of symmetry or
order of proportion. He was coal
black, had very short bowlegs, pointed
ears that on rare occasions cocked
up, inscrutable brown eyes, a three-
quarters length tail, and ragged whis-
kers. He was twice observed to run,
three times to wag his tail, and once
to look intelligent (although this last
has been debated). Despite all this,
he was accepted by the brotherhood.
And now . . ungrateful wretch! . . .
he has left his bed and board.

The beast was named Samuel Eels,
but like all people who have been giv-
en names which they neither asked for
nor liked, he let it be known that he
preferred to be called Sam, and so he
was. In fact, he went unchallenged
as Sam for at least a couple of days
when Dr. Jerry Quin, fortified with
the knowledge that had been gleaned
in several courses in medicine, ob-

GOLFERS OUT TO

LOSS TO HAWKS

Meet Iowa at Olympic on
Friday for Initial
Contest

Now that the Iowa net team has
gone back to where the tall corn
grows, and with them the proverbial
“bacon" which every visiting athletic
team strives to take back home, the
Maroon golfers are getting set for an-
other Hawkeye invasion, the match
with Iowa next Friday.

Play At Olympia

Play will be held, as in former
years at Olmypia Fields Country
Club, nationally known for its sporty
1 golf links. Captain Hisert, Johnny
1 Bartlett, Patterson, and Dorsey, mem-
bers of the Midway team, have been
practicing daily at Olympia and have
been shooting some good scores. His-
ert has not been able to play as much
as the other men. but what few rounds
he has played were up to the form
which characterized his early season
play last season. He has been work-
ing hard on a correspondence course
which will remedy- a small deficit in
gradr points and make him eligible
for Conference competition. This im-
portant matter will hinge on the out-
come of the special exam which was
administered to him yesterday- after-
noon. Hisert won the Individual Big
Ten Championship last spring, and is
conceded a good chance to repeat
this year because of his consistent
playing. It is very important to the
hopes of the Chicago team that he
clears up his scholastic difficulty.

Four Veterans Back

Patterson, Dorsey and Bartlett are
all veterans of last year's successful
outfit and should work into a winning
combination. To gether with Hisert
they make a foursome hard to outdrive
or output. Very few teams should
carry home the bacon after a match
with these men.

Purdue will come to meet the Mid-
-way team almost simultaneously with
the departure of the Iowa foursome.
Tor next Monday a match with the
Boilermakers is to be held. On May-
17 Ohio State comes to Chicago in
the remaining home meet for the lo-
cals.

Two More Leagues
Begin Play Today

This afternoon at 3:00, the Non-
fraternity league makes its indoor
baseball debut, with the playing of
two games. The powerful Mac
nine will clash with the Senators,
while the Romans will meet the Pi-
rates in what promises to be a
closely contested game. The Macs
look to be the class of the league
so far. having defeated the Law-
School handily in two practice tilts.

The Graduate leagues also open
their schedule Hitchcock Hall meet-
ing Divinity, and Packers of the C.
and A. School clashing with Snell "
Hall. The Law School will oppose
the Chicago Theological Seminary-
in the other games of the day at
4:30. The graduates are showing a
keen interest in the outcome of
these games, and the resulting con-
tests should be fast and cleanly-
played. The leaders play for the
campus title.

Tucomcari Sends in First I
Interscholastic Entry

Tucumcari High of Tucumcari, New-
Mexico has just come into a new hon-
or—that of being the first school in the
Unite I States to send in their team en-
try for the National Interscholastic
Track meet. The southern prep school
has entered an aggregation of their
stars, some of the fastest men of the
district, and they- have high hopes of
showing in the meet.

From the other side of the continent,
Canada of the far north, two other
early- entries have come in. Hamilton
Institute of Hamilton, Ontario, has
again signified an intention of enter-
ing. Two years ago the northern
school sent r stron ggroup of track-
sters to the Interscholastics and this
i year their team appears to be one of
the most formidable in the .meet
North Battlefield, Saskatchewan, is
another of the Canadian outfits which
have sent in their entry sheets. Three
or four of the canuck stars are ex-
pected to carry their colors of blue

Whether the Maroons will be hope-

or whether they will have just reason
for title hopes, will be decided at the
Midway lot this afternoon when they

by reason of their record of three

Ludlam has been pitching in a very
stylish manner all spring although he
was yanked early in the Ohio State
game to give way to Stewart. Barta,
a veteran chucker, may be called upon
to do mound duty this afternoon.

Norgren was undecided last night
as to whom he would parcel out the
pitching duties of his team. The choice
lies between Gubbins and Marks; one
to play in rightfield if the other is to
heave. Neither pitcher has hit his
true form this spring. Gubbins was
a world-beater for seven innings of
the Wisconsin game, but he was a
complete bust during the eighth while
Marks was not much better in the
ninth. Norgren will experiment again
with a new batting lineup in another

Mine lover, a buxom lad held in

Electricity, which can release
woman from her burdens, has
already created a revolution in
American industry. Wherever
mankind labors, General
Electric motors can be found
carrying loads, driving machin-
ery and saving time and labor.
And there is no branch of elec-
trical development today to
which General Electric has not
made important contributions.

A series of G-E advertisements
showing what electricity is
doing in many fields will be

In a field in sunny Spain stands a stone mortar.
Crows hover around it, picking up bits of grain and
chaff—cawing.

Here Marcheta, in the fresh beauty of her youth,
will come to pound maize. For years she will pound
maize. The stone will stand up under the blows;
not a dent has the muscle of three generations of
women made upon it. But the crows will hurl their
black gibes upon a woman aging early and bent
with toil. Old Marcheta—still in her thirties.

The American woman does not pound maize. But
she still beats carpet; she still pounds clothes; she
still pumps water. She exhausts her strength in
tasks which electricity can do better, and in half
the time.

The high ideals of a community mean little where
woman is still doomed to drudgery. But the mir-
acles which electricity already has performed
indicate but a fraction of the vast possibilities for
better living and the tremendous opportunities
which the future developments in electricity will
hold for the college man and woman.
