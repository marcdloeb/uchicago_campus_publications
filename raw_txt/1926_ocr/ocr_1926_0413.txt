hours watching at the polls today,
as a part of the attempt of the de-

Science classes will not meet today
or tomorrow.

Students are 'being supplied with
credentials as watchers and are as-
signed to posts by the candidates
for whom they have elected to
to work. It is hoped by Prof. Mer-

Political Science, who is sponsor-
ing the experiment, that such in-
timate contact with politics will be
beneficial to the students. The
service is a required part of the
Political Science courses for this
quarter. Over 300 students are ex-
pected to take part in the political
activities of the day because of this
requirement.

Radically new means are to be em-
ployed this Spring by the Employment
bureau of the University in an effort
to secure jobs for seniors after gradu-
ation. Through the efforts of R. J.
Demeree, who spent a part of last
summer in an intensive investigation
of the employment methods of other
universities and colleges, a plan has
been launched under which it is
hoped and expected that every senior
so desirous will be permanently situ-
ated in a paying job upon graduation.

The plan is something absolutely
different from anything that has ever
been attempted either here or at any
other known university. According to
Mr. Demeree, it is a digest of all the
‘good points of the plans of other uni-
versities.

Announce Details

The details of the plan are as fol-
lows :

A so-called association has been
formed of all graduating seniors, both
men and women, who are interested
in obtaining through the University
permanent jobs after graduation.
This association started meeting March
31 and will continue to meet each
Tuesday from 4 to 5 throughout the
quarter.

It has been organized in view of
the following things: First, the Em-‘
ployment bureau has secured men of
influence in the business world to come
out to the University and lecture on
different phases of business activity.

By Roselle F. Moss

"Life is in the hands of our youth
and therefore we who are older must
try to keep young spirits in order that
we may be equally modern in this
twentieth century.”

So did Vladimir Nemirovitch-Dant-
chenko free his ultra-modern theatre
of any criticism because of its liberal-
mindedness. “Our theatre is realistic
and flexible, working with the most
modern trends in writing, staging,
scenery, and costuming. We arc look-
ing toward tomorrow and trying to
prepare for that time.”

Mr. Dantchenko has come to Chi-
cago with Morris Gest’s third venture
in producing the Russian theatre in
America. The Moscow Art Theatre
Musical Studio opened last night at
the Great Northern with “Carmencita
and the Soldier,” which is a new ver-
sion of Bizet’s popular Carmen.
“Lysistrata,” a comedy by Aristoph-
anes, will be presented at the three
final performances of the limited en-
gagement of two weeks. “Carmen-
cita and the Soldier” is the height of
tragic drama, while “Lysistrata” goes
to the opposite theatrical extreme of
hilarious farce.

With his wife, Mme. Dantchenko,
intrepreting for the reporters, the aris-
tocratic Russian gentleman expounded
his views on the woman's function in
perpetuating art. “Women being hin-

WOMEN LEAD MEN
AT NORTHWESTERN

Scholastic records made public by
the registrar of Northwestern uni-
versity show that during the first se-
mester sorority girls proved them-
selves better students than fraternity
men.

In the system of grading in use 2.5
represents perfection. 1 is considered
the pasyng grade. Fifteen out of the
twenty-two fraternities achieved the
passing mark. Five sororities had
higher averages than any fraternity
and the lowest of girls’ organizations
succeeded in bettering the coveted 1.

The figures show that the general
average of the 404 members of soror-
ities was 1.414. A year ago the aver-
age was 1.506. Kappa Sigma Tau,
with eleven members, led the sororities
with an average 2.016, the highest
made by any girls’ organizations in
the last four semesters.

Men undergraduates in university
dormitories, of whom there are ninety-
two, had averages considerably above
those of the 492 members of frater-
nities. The general fraternity average
during the first semester this year was
I 049. as compared with 1.029 for the
same period a year ago.

Under the auspices of Forge and
the Poetry club, Carl Sandburg, Chi-
cago poet, will give an address in
Mandel hall on Tuesday evening,
April 20.

Since Sandburg’s last appearance
at the University several years ago
he has published his successful “Chi-
cago Poems” and just recently his
great prose triumph “Abraham Lin-
coln.” Rising from comparitive ob-
scurity in the last ten years he is
now generally conceded to be Chi-
cago’s brightest literary light.

People who have heard Sandburg
sing “Frankie and Johnnie” and bis
numerous other rollicking ballads will
appreciate the fact that he has three
new ones for this occasion that have
never been sung before. He will read
poems of the street and of the prairie
with their long swinging rhythm and
he may even tell one of his Rootabaga
Stories.

Tickets are oh sale at Woodworth’s
and the University Bookstore.

Of twenty-two awards made to
American professors by the American
council of Learned Societies this year,
four were bestowed upon members
of the University of Chicago faculty,
it was announced today by the council.

The following University of Chi-
cago professors, received the awards:

Prof. C. R. Baskerville, $125 to aid
him in the completion of his history
of song drama in England in the 16th
and 17th centuries.

Prof. C. H. Beeson, $300 to aid him
in the completion of manuscripts of
the medieval humanist Lupus of
Ferrieres.

Prof. David H. Stevens, $150 to aid
him in the completion of » bibliogra-
phy of Milton.

Prof. William A. Nitze, $300 to aid
him in collating the Brussels manu-
script of the Perlesvaus Romance.

In making the awards the council
commended the men for their excel-
lent work in their various fields and

A discussion of the value of the Fed-
eration of University Women as a I
campus organization will be included in j
the program for the meeting tonight '
from 7 to 8 in the library of Ida Noyes I
hall. “A Meeting on Meetings” is the
name chosen to describe the discussion.
According to Dorothy Kennedy, chair-
man of Federation, members of the
council are endeavoring to obtain the
sentiment of the women concerning
the real value of Federation,

Prominent women on campus have
been expressing their views on the
subject at the meetings of the council.
The opinions thus secured will be util-;
ized in constructive plans for the im- j
provement of Federation. In addition
the women will be asked to give sug-
gestions of subjects which they would
like to have discussed at the coming
Federation meetings. By considering '
problems of interest on campus, the

organization’s council hopes to
tion more effectively.

Study or Flunk

Harvard Orders

Because pl too much outside ac-
tivity and not enough study 147
freshmen in the Harvard Law
school failed to pass their final ex-
aminations. Havinv failed to meas-
ure up to the necessary require-
ments of the school they were ex-
cluded. Of the 500 who entered the
school last fall 497 took the ex-
aminations. Thirty-four per cent
of those who entered the school
are out at the end of their first
year.

According to the Harvard Crim-
son, Dean Roscoe Pond ascribes
the greatest cause for so many
failures to the necessity of the
students to devote a considerable
part of their time and energy to
outside activity.

Many other causes were given
for the noticeable lack of interest
on the student’s part in his studies.

PROF. VERIFIED
BY DISCOVERIES

Prove Shishak Solomon’s
Father-in-law

The recent discover}' by the Uni-
versity expedition in Palestine of a
tablet fragment which shows plainly
that the pharaoh Shishak captured
Armageddon as related in the Bible
tends to prove that this Egyptian
monarch was also the father-in-law
of King Solomon, according to Prof.
T. G. Allen, secretary of the Univer-
sity oriental institute. Prof. Allen
gave this additional interpretation to
the discovery as announced by Prof.
James H. Breasted yesterday.

For some years Prof. Breasted has
held the theory that Solomon married
Shishak’s daughter, Solomon being at
the time a vassal of the pharaoh’s,
Prof. Allen pointed out. This find at
Armageddon where Prof. Breasted’s
staff is excavating offers new and al-
most conclusive evidence that Prof.
Breasted’s hunch was right because
it shows that Shishak was a belliger-
ent and successful king who had ac-
tually entered Palestine and it was that
kind of ruler, the ancient records show,
who gave a daughter in marriage to
Solomon.

ENTERTAIN WOMEN
IN C. AND A. WITH
GET-TOGETHER TEA

Miss Grace Burns of the Comad
Advisory Board of the Commerce

and Administration office will enter-

tain all C. and A. women students at
a tea to be given tomorrow at 4 in
Ida Noyes hall..

"This tea will wive the C. and A.
women students an opportunity to be-
come better acquainted with each
other, and also to enjoy themselves
thoroughly,” said Miss Burns, hostess
at the tea. All women who expect to
attend have been asked to sign up in
the C. and A. building today.

Comad is a new club formed by
women of the C. and A. school to fur-
their social relations.

C. Cestre Speaks on

Poetry of Wm. Moody

Since the establishment of the Wil-
liam Vaughn Moody lecture series,
the first talk to he presented on the
poetry of Mr. Moody will be given
today at 4:30 in Harper Assembly
room. Charles Cestre, professor of
American Literature at the University
of Paris, will lecture on “The Poetry
of William Vaughn Moody.”

Mr. Moody was a member of the
faculty of the University until his
death a few years ago. All students of
the University and the public have
been invited to attend this lecture.

END DRIVE FOR
SUBSCRIPTIONS

AT NOON TODAY

Saleswomen May Collect
Commissions Between

12 and 1

“\\ on’t you buy a subscription to
The Daily Maroon?”

Noon today marks the closing hour
for forty campus saleswomen to make
their plea on the quadrangles. All
through Maroon Week subscription
teams have been stationed at import-
ant points of the campus, topping last
year's drive by more than one hun-
dred subscriptions, according to Ruth
Burtis, chairman of the campaign.

Pass Quota

The quota of 200 new subscriptions
was passed early Friday morning, and
the numbers have been steadily in-
creasing. Last year’s campaign netted
150 subscriptions, while the present
campaign is expected to far exceed
that record.

"We have worked steadily with the
hope of giving the majority of the
student body an opportunity to have
their own publication,” said Miss Bur-

tis. “I want to congratulate my help-
ers for their incessant efforts, and
thank all those who have contributed
in any way to the success of hte
drive.”

Mixer Successful

Two hundred and fifty students
thronged the Maroon-decorated south
lounge of the Reynolds club Friday
afternoon, and danced from 4 until
6 o’clock to the strains of Bill Hahn’s
College Crew. The Maroon Mixer,
first mixer of the Spring quarter, was
an overwhelming success.

Saleswomen will meet today from
12 to 1 in the Maroon office to turn in
ail subscriptions and receive their
commissions. The winning team will
be announced in Wednesday’s Daily
Maroon.

COUNCIL RECOGNIZE

MURRAY-BALLOU CLUB
AS OFFICIAL SOCIETY

The Murray-Ballou club which was
organized last fall for Universalist
students and members of the other
liberal churches, has just received
recognition from the Undergraduate
Council as an official organization of
the University. The officers of the

club are Louisa Magraw, president;
Margaret Bay, vice president; and
Lambert Case, secretary-treasurer.
Dr. L. Ward Brigham, dean of Ryder
Divinity school is the sponsor of the
club.

A meeting of the organization will
be held today at 4:30 in the Alumnae
room of Ida Noyes hall.

NAME COMET FOUND

BY UNIVERSITY PROF.

Of the nine comets observed so far
this year by University of Chicago
astronomers, one was discovered by
Professor George Van Biesbroeck, of
the University staff at the Yerkes Ob-
servatory, and will be identified in
laboratories throughout the world as
the Van Biesbroeck comet, according
to a recent statement by Director E.
B. Frost. While looking for a comet
first seen by an amateur astronomer
named Peltier in Ohio, Professor Van
Biesbroeck saw another comet cross-
ing the orbit of the Peltier comet and
it was immediately picked up through
a powerful refracting telescope. Pho-
tographs have been taken at the Ob-
servatory of both the Van Biesbroeck
and the Peltier comets, to be filed
with prints previously made of fam-
ous comets like Halley’s and Brook’s.

Although our solar system contains
from 100,000 to 1,000,000 comets, ac-
cording to an estimate made by Di-
rector Frost, the greater part of
these never get within the range of
human vision, and there is little like-
lihood that the earth and a wambl-
ing comet will ever collide.

A composite picture of The Indiana Man, found in The Indiana
Daily Student in the form of answers to an inquiring reporter:

“What Do You Think of the Indi-

Katherine Welman, *26—They are
pretty good sports. The average In-
diana man is an excellent dancer and
dresses well, but isn't so well versed
conversationally.

Ruth Briggs, ’27—I don’t think the
Indiana men are such terrible dates.
People give them credit or being worse
than they really are. Our lx>ys aren't
very witty, but they certainly are good
dancers.

Ann Wright, ’28—Oh, they’re fair.

You can have a good time with them.
They aren’t niggardly spenders, and
the Indiana men are creditable danc-
ers.

Ruth Kirby, *29—I am tongue-tied
on that subject.

Myra Montgomery,’27—Sometimes
I think they are all “candies," but
since I have been over to Onio State
I appreciate the ones here a little more.

tions, will be present from time to time
to “look over’’ the group and get in
touch with those who they think
might be useful to them. Thirdly,
“kings of industry” will lecture on the
attributes of a successful business
man.

Plan Special Meetings

The Bureau has also in mind an
elaboration upon this plan. After the
first meetings of the association it is
planned to divide the group into small-
er groups composed of men interested
in particular phases of business. That
is to say, all those interested in ad-
vertising, for instance, will meet in a
separate group, and prominent men
and employers in the advertising field
will be secured to talk to them.

The Employment bureau will be,
of course, in direct charge of the so-
called Association, and will arrange
interviews between employers and
prospective job-getters.

Complete Arrangements

Arrangements have already been
made for employers from Marshall
Field, Armour. Bell Telephone and
several real estate and life insurance
companies to speak, and other em-
ployers are constantly being ap-
proached. According to Mr. Demerec,
it is hoped that by June 1. every per-
son in the group may have a choice
of five jobs.

Mr. Demeree is anxious to confer
with the seniors desirous of obtaining
permanent jobs who are not already
connected with the Association.

of the fragment, it was thought but
not conclusively proved that Shishak
.was the king who gave Solomon the
city. He could not have been one of
the degenerate kings at the close of
the twenty-first dynasty, Prof. Breast-
ed thought, but an aggressive ruler
who resumed Egypt’s control in Pal-
estine. And there was no other king
at the time who answered the descrip-
tion so well as Shishak, in Prof.
Breasted’s opinion. The finding in
Palestine of a piece of tablet with
Shishak’s name plainly inscribed in
Egyptian would indicate that it was
Shishak who became Solomon’s mili-
tary and domestic overlord because it
show’s that he was the aggressive king
who conquered the cities of Palestine,
notably Jerusalem and Armageddon.

BY HARRY SHLAES

(Sports Editor}

Playground Ball, the major sport
for Spring Quarter, will take its us-
ual place in the spotlight among the
various campus organizations within
the iP’t few days. The Intra-mural
departure.- has sent out application
blanks to all the fraternity groups on
campus and hopes for a complete
representation among them as well as
representation by non-fraternity
groups.

Tourney a Success

I^ast year the tourney was repeat-
edly interrupted by hard rains and
wet playing fields, but yet was a
great success because of the untiring
efforts of John Howe, who is the pres-
ent Spring Intra-mural manager.
According to the plans of the depart-
ment, the tourney this year will be
the greatest thus far.

Entries close on Monday, April 16
so that drawings can be made and the
various schedules formed. Participa-
tion points will be awarded as fol-
lows: fifty points for entry, ten for a
league champion.

Beautiful loving cups will be given
each league champion in the fratern-
ity leagues, ten bronze medallettes for
the non-fraternity champions and ten
for each member of the graduate
league winning organization. Specia1
trophies descriptive of the sport will
be awarded the three final winning
teams, besides gold, silver and bronze
medallettes to the members of the re-
spective first, second and third squads.

Regular Rules

Games will be played according to
the regular Playground ball rules and
all equipment will be furnished by
the Intra-mural Department. Paid um-
pires will officiate at the games to
insure competent and fair treatment.

The playing fields are located at
59th and Cottage Grove, where four
diamonds will be constructed. This
is a great improvement over last
year, wherein the fields were scattered
all over campus.

COVER FOR ILLINOIS
GRIDIRON IS COMING

Urbana, Ill., April 12.—The “rain-
coat” for the football field of the Uni-
versity of Illinois is on the way from
an eastern factory. The giant fabric,
which is to cover the entire gridiron
between games if the weather threat-
ens, is to be made in four, sections of
158 by 83 feet each.

A great deal of interest hinges on
this innovation and university officials
are answering requests from other in-
stitutions for information. The cost
of the cover is nearly $10,000 and this
will probably put one out of reach of
all except the larger universities. The
cover will be placed flat oft the field
with no kind of support, as the grid-
iron slopes from the center, allowing
water to drain. It will take at least
four men to roll it up by sections and
when it is not in use it will be stored
under the stadium in a great hall.

Get-Together at Reynolds
Is Huge Success

Varsity mermen participated in a
banquet that culminated their rather
successful season last night. Speeches
made by various members of the
team and a few words by Coach
Stagg and MacGillivray helped to
make the get-together one to be re-
membered by those who are leaving
the school this quarter.

The Varsity and Freshman swim
teams travel tonight to the Engle-
wood Y. M, C. A. which is to open
its tank with an exhibition by the
Maroon swimmers. The exhibition
meet is to start at 8 o’clock at 66
and Union Streets which happens to
be the exact site of the new building.

A four man relay, two hundred
yard breastroke, backstroke, medley
relay and two hundred yard swims
are scheduled. E. Dorf, former Con-
ference champion and Captain is to
give an exhibition on the spring
board with the help of Eddy Fellinger
hnd Tudor Wilder.

Captain Noyes, Harry Rittenhouse,
Jerry Greenberg, Charlie Ijane, Gil-
christ, Baumrucher, Petrolowitz, Jel-
inek and Markley are to be the main-
stays of the varsity nucleus, while
Captain Oker, Hough, Florez ,Get-
siv, Bay, Laxezzorio and Stevenson
will support the freshman honors.

“Here is an excellent chance in-
deed, to see next year’s material in
action, and at the same time say good
bye to the boys who after three years
of competition for the school, have
to leave us to join in a struggle in
which competition is far greater than
in College.”

IN - BETWEEN - TIMES EATING

1 lave you noticed that when other eating places are deserted there is
always someone eating at THE SHANTY.

Patrons have come to know that THE SHANTY is prepared to
serve them from 7:30 A. M. to 7:30 P. M. — with no intermission.

When you sleep too late and miss your breakfast or your class dis-
misses just too late for lunch at your regular eating place, hie you straight
to THE SHANTY, where special effort has been made to take care
of this in-between-trade, with attractive menus and alert, attentive service.

Bring a friend over to Afternoon Tea today—

By George Gruskin

Way up in the wilds of Corvallis,
Ore., where the Oregon Agricultural
College is i seated, the lost infant art
of roller-ski ting is fast gaining favor
among the students and the athletic
board is considering the passing out
of gym credits with every pair of the
ball-bearing vehicles sold at the uni-
versity supply department.

Students in Corvallis skate back and
forth to school on tennis courts, and
on the concrete pavements. As there
is danger of serious collisions with
automobiles, the traffic is kept off sev-
eral blocks of cement roadway every
afternoon for skating, while all of the
cars in town are equipped with broom-
like devices attached to the front and
rear fenders that tend to brush away
any skaters daring to come too close.

This forward step by the students of
the (). A. C. in the development of
athletics among the common people
of America, should find immediate
favor in the eyes of our campus sports-
men. • Imagine the possibilities of
roller skates on the quadrangles?
Benches could be erected all along
the sidewalks, while off to the side of
every building parking stations might
be constructed. If a fee of five cents
a skate per hour were charged, there
is no doubt but that inside of a year
enough money could be raised to keep
all of the red-hot stand men on cam-
pus in sanitary rubber gloves. Be-
sides this boon to the general health
of our student-body, think of the great
saving on shoe leather that would be
a direct result of adopting the fad.
Roller skates—for health and thrift!

MAROON NINE GOES
TO INDI ANOPOLIS FOR

GAME ON SATURDAY

Coach Paul “Tony” Hinkle’s strong
Butler nine will play host to the dia-
mond squad of his Alma Mater, when
the Maroons meet the Hoosiers at In-
dianapolis on Saturday. It will be the
second game for Chicago, while But-
ler has the benefit of a southern trip.
The game should be close since the
Maroons are rapidly rounding- into
shape and the battery of Marks and
Webster appears too clever for the
Butler collegians. Butler was defeat-
ed by Ohio State last Saturday so
Norgren has high hopes of winning.

In the past, Pat Page has develop-
ed some well rounded teams at the
Hoosier school, and this year under
the tutelage of Hinkle, the Indianapo-
lis team should furnish plenty of op-
position to the Maroons.

Elect Joe Gubbins

Baseball Captain

Joseph Gubbins, midget mound-
man of the Maroon baseball nine,
was unanimously elected to the
position of 1926 captain, at a meet-
ing held last Saturday afternoon
directly following the daily w*ork-
out of the team. The new leader
is recognized as one of the best
pitchers in the Big Ten, and it was
largely due to his stellar hurling
last Spring that Chicago placed sec-
ond in the Conference title race.

Joie is also the smallest hurler in
Big Ten circles, and last year was
the only left hander. Lie has played
ball all his life, and will make a
good successor to Red Cunningham
as leader, due to his long experi-
end and through knowledge of the
game. He played three years with
a local prep school, St. Ignatius of
Loyola, where he captained the
nine for two years, distinguishing
himself as one of the best pitchers
in the city.

in the 160 relay and Nelson brought
in a third in the 100 yard breast-

Out for Practice

By Tom Stephenson

Hopes for a championship ball club
took form yesterday afternoon, when
Nels Norgren and his Maroon ball
players got out into the open, and
tried out their arms, batting eyes, and
so forth in some real battle, a five-
inning practice tilt. The game ended
in a 5 to 5 draw, the regulars holding
the lead until the last inning, when
the subs rallied with some two and
three base hits, which brought them
four tallies, and the tie score.

Most of the numeral men of last
year’s yearling team are out for the
varsity this year, and are all ready
threatening last year’s men for their
jobs. These sophomores made up most
jf the second team line-up yesterday,
and it is very evident that there will
be an abundance of material this
Spring, all but five of last year’s
clever outfit being, back.

Norgren Pitches

Gubbins, Hoerger, Schneberger,
Anderson, McConnell, Brignall,
Marks, and Macklind composed the
first team line-up, with Coach Nor-
gren and his assistant, Red Cunning-
ham doing the mound work to save
the arms of the pitching staff for the
game with Northwestern, next Wed-
nesday. Hoerger substituted for
Webster, the regular catcher, in the
