Thirty men, one in each fraternity (

chairmen of the reception, rushing,
and housing committees for the
World’s Greatest Interscholastic, held
at Grant Park on June 4 and 5, to
work in conjunction with the com-
mittees and take charge of the team
assigned to their respective houses.

The work of the appointees will
be that of a special committee to
take more of a personal interest in
the men entering the track meet than j

“Immersed in thought, I wan-
dered down State Street yesterday
afternoon. When on the corner
of Jackson and State, just outside
of the Hub clothing store, a most
singular thing happened. Two men
were busy cleaning the top story
of the building when one of their
scaffolding ropes broke, causing
a plank to slide off. It struck a
row of flower boxes on the sec-
ond floor. Three of them fell off,
one of which hit a man and
stunned him while the two others
landed a few feet away.”

Thus spoke Tom Field, member
of the staff. Field was engaged on
Maroon business at the time and
attributes his salvation to his per-

men, and directing an energetic rush-

Have Vital Part

“The men selected in the various
houses have a very important role to
play in the coming Interscholastic,”
said Thomas Mulroy, student man-
ager of the meet yesterday.

“The men appointed on the com-
mission will have so much work to
do that they will not be able to give
their attention to every man enter-
ing the track meet. Since every man
entering this meet has outstanding
ability, not one must be overlooked.
By naming one man in each house to
take an active part, every man will
receive the attention that is due him
and an active rushing campaign may
be conducted.”

SOCIOLOGISTS TO

Redfield Moves to Mexican
Adobe Village

From comfortable apartment in
Chicago to primitive adobe village in
Mexico is the move soon to be made
by a University scholar and his wife
who have been assigned to study
the Mexican peasants by the depart-
ment of anthropology. The investi-
gator is Robert Redfield, fellow of
the Social Research council. He will
leave for Mexico this summer, ac-
ompanied by Mrs Redfield, the daugh-

ter of Prof. R. E. Park,
logist.

NEW HEAD OF

Raymond Oshimo was elected presi-
dent of the International Students
Association at a meeting held last Fri-
day. Mona Volkert was elected vice-
president of the organization, while
Antonio Rivera and Alice Kinsman
were elected respectively to the posi-
tions of recording secretary and cor-
responding secretary. Milquedaz Ibi-
anez will be the new treasurer. The
newly elected members at large are
William Pauk, Harry Whang, and
Haksoo Kim.

These officers will be installed at a
dinner to be held Friday, May 21.
The place has not been decided on,
but, according to H. Y. Cho, former
president of the organization it will
probably be held in Hutchinson Com-
mons.

Cooper Cole, is to gather scientific
information, through a study of cus-
toms and living conditions, about the
Mexican peasant who constitutes an
important immigration problem in
this country at the present time. It
is only by understanding how these
alien peoples live at home that we
can understand their needs or mis-
demeanors in their adopted country.
Prof. Cole asserts.

Perhaps 7,000 Mexicans enter the
United ‘States every year and the
number is steadily increasing, Prof.
Cole believes. These immigrants
bring with them all the traditions
and habits of life they have learned
through generations in their native
homes. When they enroll in Ameri-
can labor they meet conditions for-
eign to them, and they try to adapt
themselves to those conditions. It is
with a view to making that adjust-
ment easier both for the American

Comad Club Elects
Officers Tomorrow

Comad club will elect officers for
the coming year from the slates pre-
sented by the nominating committee,
tomorrow at 4 in Room 101 of the C.
and A. building. The nominees, who
were introduced at the last meeting
are as follows, for president, Cath-
erine Stouffer and Lillian Haas; for
vice-president, Laura Nolan, Betty
Starr and Mildred Keller; and for
secretary-treasurer, , Dorothy Kaup
and Julia Wiedel. Refreshments will
be served immediately after the bal-
loting.

On the other hand, the vaude-
ville’s the thing.

Plans for the senior fly-by-night,
two-a-day program scheduled for
June 4 make Blackfriar’s look like
amateurs, if Fred Handschy, co-
manager with Helen Liggett, hasn’t
exaggerated in outlining details of
this year’s production of the annual
occasion. The acts will hold forth in
Mandel hall, before fraternity and
club groups, and the critical eyes of
undergraduates in general.

Preliminary tryouts for acts will be
held the beginning of next week.
Contrary to precedent, members of
all classes will have the opportunity
to display their talent. It is by this
method that the chairmen expect to
obtain for the 1926 senior vaude-
ville all of the best campus talent.
Those who plan acts are asked to
outline the details of their stunt and
present them to the chairmen be-
fore preliminary tryouts.

The death of President Burton
prevented the presentation of last
year’s vaudeville. Before that time,
according to Handschy, who has seen
the occasion yearly for many years,
senior vaudeville was truly col-
legiate, the only classic that really
embodied the quintessence of cam-
pus itself.

Phoenix, Sans
Title, Is Out

Next Thursday

Contrary to all precedent the May
number of the Phoenix which will ap-
pear on Thursday, May 13, bears no
title. So many titles were suggest-
ed, that the staff decided not to give
the issue an official title.

The campus wits have concerned
themselves chiefly with the Black-
friars, and Spring. There is a write-
up of a Blackfriars’ rehearsal ac-
companied by action" sketches by
James Root. Langdon Caldwell
Dewey, although not in /residence I

What has been the fate of

Mar-

Police offiials, University investi-
gators and relatives have searched
the country for two weeks, and the
quest for the missing student has
come to a standstill. Without a clue,
every possible source of information
fruitlessly exhausted, the searchers
are blanked.

Miss Lawrenz disappeared from
her room at 5460 University Avenue
two weeks ago today. No indications
that she intended staying away was
found among her personal effects.

Led Solitary Life

The girl, who was known to have
led a comparatively solitary life, had
no reason for violent action, accord-
ing to instructors and the few ac-
quaintances she had. An attack of
influenza during the winter left no
apparent depression.

But two weeks have passed and
the country has been scoured in vain, :
Her father, Herman Lawrenz. a re-1
tired planter of Elberta. Alabama, I
came to Chicago soon after her dis- i
appearance and has searched night j
and day. The Hyde Park police ad-
mitted today that they were baffled,
and University authorities have like-
wise come to the end of a string of
possible clues.

Theories Unsubstantiated

THwies were advanced that the
girl had gone away for “the fun of
it,” and that she would return when
her money gave out. None, however,
have been substantiated.

The University has joined Mr.
Lawrenz and the police in an appeal
for any information whatsoever re-
garding the girl. Mrs. K. K. Link, of

The great Neff, having recover-
ed from the mumps, is back in the
mustache race with redoubled en-
erygy, determined to do his best
for Phi Psi and himself. He is de-
voting most of his time to experi-
ments with various waxes and
tonics in the hope of increasing
the daily growth of hair—at least
so run the rumors. His mustache
looked quite promising when seen
in front of Cobb yesterday morn-
ing.

Ad Wilson; after a week-end
rest, is in training again. “I feel
in better condition than I did a
week ago and feel sure of at least
placing in the race,” said he. “I
think my chances of winning are
very good, although 1 recognize
the caliber of my great rival Neff.”

Doc Bratfish, who a week ago
was sure that Mulioy would be
the winner, is now a convinced
Wilsonian.

BLACKFRIARS TO
TRY FEATURES
FOR 1926 SHOW

Include Saxaphone Sextette,
Minstrel Show, and
Apache Dance

Two features which have never
been attempted by the Blackfriars of
former years will be tried this year,
j The first of these features is to re-
call members of the casts of former
plays for the purpose of broadcast-
ing. The second is to install a black-
face minstrel show, a saxophone sex-
tette, and a apache dance into the
lines of the play.

Adrian Kraus who played a lead-
ing roll in thfe '“Ma'chinations of
Max,” Blackfriar production of six
years ago, will sing a song-hit from
that play. The name of it is “I Wish
I Were a Baby Doll.” The number
will be broadcast over WGN tomor-
row night in a program lasting from
7:45 to 8:10. Campus women will
also figure in the program according
to Gifford Hitz, manager. They will
sing Blackfriar lyrics with actual
feminine vocal chords.

EXIT THE DEBATE

pOLLEGES and universities are places set aside for the develop-
ment of the intellect. Yet there are no intercollegiate mental
competitions except debates. That, we believe, is a curious char-
acteristic of our American schools.

Even debates are becoming rather pitiful affairs. During the
past fifteen years there have been unmistakable signs of decadance
in the debate as an institution. Students showed very little interest
in the recent Princeton-Chicago debate. Even he English teams,
with remarkable personnels, did not interest the whole student
body. Is it because they are growing mentally phlegmatic, disown-
ing the good old collegiate debate for primitive, physical competi-
tion? or is it because debates — and all other forms of mental com-
petitions as well — are mismanaged, unadvertised, or underestimat-
ed by faculties? In despair we give up. Some brave philosopher
has suggested that because of the new “cooperative” idea of a de-
bate whereby one school does not definitely line up against the
other, issue versus issue, all competition has dropped out of the
sport. Perhaps they are right. If it is mere competition that
students like why not dig into the annals of the past century and re-
store the dear old spell-down. It contained the maximum amount
of competition.

To consider the question, a meeting was recently brought to-
gether, at the suggestion of the New York Times, with representa-
tives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, the Uni-
versity of Chicago, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, West Point
and Annapolis. They formulated plans whereby students of less
than four years undergraduate standing were entitled to compete
annually for prizes of two hundred and fifty dollars for the most
intelligent knowledge of the events of the year; and the winners of
the prizes at their own colleges then to compete for a grand prize
of six hundred dollars.

It is an attempt to restore interest in intellectual pursuits. Ath-
letic interest and competition has arisen head and shoulders above
the mental. In the old days there was a national cry for “physical
education and development for all” which is fair enough. But when
universities and colleges put the animal forms of competition on
the top of Mitchell tower and leave the intellectual mental forms
in the depths of the Botany pond it is time for a rearranging of
interests.

Does the Bond Business
Need College Men?

DECIDEDLY, it does. Modern investment banking
requires well trained, analytical minds today, even
more than in the past.

Greatly increased wealth in this country has made a
large class of new, rather inexperienced investors. They
need competent, responsible advice—to guide them to-
ward sound investments, suited to their needs.

Complex financing due co organization of business in
larger units requires more alertness in the selection of
securities. Even the experienced bond buyer must have
expert, well-informed service.

Halsey, Stuart & Co. recruits additions to its organiza-
tion,in both the buying and the selling ends, largely from
the universities and colleges. Men are carefully chosen
for their general qualifications and (hen given special
training for several months, with pay, before they are
assigned to actual work.

DELTA SIG LOSES

TO KAPPA NU IN

FOURTEEN INNINGS

Delta Chi, Tau Sigs and
Phi Pi Phi Win

Games

Intra-mural ballmen played some
fast games yesterday afternoon. Kap-
pa Nu upset Delta Sigs; Tau Sig
defeated Alpha Delt; Phi Pi Phi won
from Alpha Epsilon Pi; the Tekes
beat the Zetes and Delta Chi defeat-
ed Delta Tau Delta. All the games
were close and hard fought.

Stone Knocks Homer

With Klaff of Kappa Nu and Gask-
ill of Delta Sigma Phi, pitching air-
tight hall, Kappa Nu beat out the
Delta Sigs yesterday at the end of
fourteen innings by a score of 4
to 3. Stone, with one out, banged
the home run hit which brought in
Gettleman from third base with the
winning run.

Perfect fielding on both sides saved
the game for each pitcher on num-
erous ocasions. The tied score was
effected early in the game, and after
the fourth inning, although runners
threatened from third base, both Gas-
kill and Klaff were able to retire,
succeeding batters scoreless.

Last year both teams playing in
the semi-finals battled similarly for
fourteen innings, with the Delta
Sigs coming out on top. This game
puts Kappa Nu in first place in
Gamma league, and marks them as
dangerous candidates for all-school
honors.

Poor support on the part of the Al-
pha Delt fielders and teamwork on
the part of Tau Sigs enabled the
Tau Sig squad to win their game by
the imposing score of 10 to 2. In
the first and the fourth frames the
winners piled up eight runs and with
the two runs that they gathered in
the third they won the game.

In one of the close games of the
day the Tekes nipped a Z. B. T.
rally to capture the final honors 10
to 7. Jelinek and Egan each gath-
ered three runs for the Tekes. The
Zetes put up a hard hitting rally in
the sixth, but the Teke fielders broke
it up.

Phi Pi Phi ran away from Alpha
Epsilon Pi 11 to 4 on an orgy of
hits by the Phi Pi’s. The whole team
broke into the run column.

How’s This As .

Inducement For

Gopher Players

By Victor Roterus

Visions of a college letter and
glory are not the only factors stir-
ring the University of Minnesota, ball
nine to doing bigger and better
things. There’s a practical solution
offered for high standing of the
Gophers in the present Conference
race.

At Minneapolis a number of enthu-
siastic merchants are offering the
boys all sorts of prizes for unusual
accomplishments on the baseball dia-
mond, and the Northern club swing-
ers have not been slow in turning
the necessary trick to come into pos-
session of them. Stark, shortstop,
Serline, centerfielder, and Mason,
second baseman, have all gargled
down a couple of gratis malted milks
for scoring runs. The drinks were
on Stiffy’s Emporium.

Stark Gets Cap

Because he slammed in the first
run Stark was also awarded a hot
collegiate cap in the company of
which Stark, a modest young chap,
has some doubts about appearing in
public. Again Stark realized on his
prowess when he spanked out the
first Gopher hit of the year. Mike
and Gus’ Haircutting Parlor have
tendered him a regulation hair-cut,
throwing in a free shave through
sheer and beautiful generosity.

Big Frameup

But all the awards have not gone
to Stark alone. Herman Ascher,
football captain last fall, received a
fountain pen from Perine’s Book
Store for making the first put-out at
third. This looks suspiciously like
a deliberate frameup as Ascher is the
regular third baseman.

Nydahl, three letter athlete,
cashed in on a tube of Williams’
shaving cream when he lifted the
ball for the first triple.

No one has, as yet, annexed the
glove being offered by Slim’s Hard-
ware store for the first homerun of
the season. Hence the intensive bat-
ting drill through which the Gophers
go daily. .

PARK PLAYGROUNDS
PLAY CHAMPIONSHIP

VOLLEY-BALL GAME

Championship volley-ball teams of
the Cornell and Palmer south-side
playgrounds will play the final game
to decide the victor, tonight at 8 on
Dudley Field. All members of volley-
ball- classes have been urged to see
the exhibition game. Those attend-
ing will be excused from gymnasium
classes today but will register at the
game this evening.

The game was arranged through
the aid of Mr. John Reynolds who
is in charge of all playgrounds un-
der the supervision of the South Park
Commissioners.

W. A. A. will entertain the visit-
ing teams immediately after the
game in the gym on the second floor
of Ida Noyes hall where refresh-
ments will be served.

Falk Wins Annual
Fencing Tournament

Charles Falk, by taking first
place in stwo of the three events
included in the Intramural Fenc-
ing Tourney, held Friday after-
noon at Bartlett Gym, won first
honors. Louis Campor placed sec-
ond and Gilbert Hayes third, win-
ning their way to the top over a
score of duel aspirants.

Falk appointed his adversaries
in the foils and sabres events af-
ter a long and trying list of vic-
tories, some of which were very
close. Campor made his way to
the Duelling Sword title by a
string of clear cut victories. Hayes
took a second in the sabres and a
third in the swords events.

These men exhibited promising
ability, and together with sev-
eral others who showed up well in
j the tourney, will be recruited into
| the varsity next year.

BALLMEN POINT

FOR PURPLE WIN

Locals Plan to Revenge
12-5 Defeat

Another mid-week game is carded
for the Maroon ball team. The Pur-
ple Nine is coming to play a return
battle on the Norgrenite Diamond
tomorrow afternoon.

Another thriller is expected. It
will be a revenge game for the Ma-
roons, who opened the season at
Evanston with a 12 to 5 setback.
Northwestern also has an edge on
the Norgrenites in the Big Ten
Standing, having won over Iowa and
Chicago and lost to Purdue and Wis-
consin for .500 per cent, while the
Maroons have won one. lost three.

Coach Norgren has been working
hard to keep his team a going in
the pace which characterized the
glorious last innings of the Illini
hattie. Now that the boys have hit
a winning stride they should con-
tinue with the Championship form
which has been expected of them
since the season opened. They'have
played enough hall now to make up
for the lack of a spring training trip,
which handicapped them in the early
games with nines that • had gained
considerably by southern tours and
pre-season practice.

Gubbins and Macklind will con-
stitute the Maroon hurling force,
with Ted Zimmerman on reserve.
The temporary ineligibility of Wal-
lie Marks will greatly handicap the
pitching department of the locals.
Palmer, because of his success against
the Norgrenites at Evanston, will
probably hurl for the Wildcats.

Bring Veteran Squad to
Midway for Net

Honors

Maroon netmen will attempt to
ring up their first win when the Pur-
ple team led by Captain Bill Sherril
meets them here today.

The Purple players tied Purdue a
week ago Saturday in their opening
meet, and beat Indiana, 4 matches
to 2, the Wednesday following. Mar-
quette and Wisconsin were met over
'the week-end, the Methodists break-
ing even on the two meets.

Capt. Sherrill, the Northwestern
act, has been one of the best match
players in the Conference for two
years, and he has two other veterans
backing him, John Phillips and Eric
Collins. Harvey Howard is the other
singles regular, with John Timm, a
freshman star last season, the num-
ber five man and doubles alternate.

The powerful Illinois tennis team
handed the Maroons their second
straight defeat when they won 4 to 2,
the downstaters taking three singles
and a doubles match with the Ma-
roons winning one singles and one
doubles match. Schapinsky was the
lone singles victor, beating Bard 9-7,
6-1.

Hudlin and Hall were the doubles
winners beating Bard and Clark in
straight sets 6-2, 6-2.

PREP FENCING MEET
HELD AT BARTLETT
PROVES BIG SUCCESS

Real excitement as well as admir-
able fencing were the outstanding
points of the High School Fencing
Meet. Not having the experience of
the other men, the technique is us-
ually poor and the individual bouts
of little interest. “This year, how-
ever, there was high caliber perform-
ances in this class,” said Coach Mer-
rill, “in fact I believe the fencing
was better than that of the other
divisions.” Fred Siebert of Lane won
the foil tourney after eliminating a
number of clever and experienced
fencers.

Miss Blanche Jorgenson, unat-
tached, defeated Miss Ruth McHugh
of Vorwaerts Turnzein in an excep-
tionally hard fought women’s match.
Women have become more interested
in this sport in the last few years
and at present there is a great num-
ber of expert foil handlers on par
with male fencers.

The Illinois fencer’s League, or-
ganized just this year, in which the
University Fencing Department is
taking active interest, is holding its
first open meet at Hamlin Park, play
grounds.

Macs Slap Way to
I-M Handball Title

Displaying the most finished
handball of the Intramural tour-
nament, the Mac team of Irving
Goodman and Ned Silvermn
slapped their way to the Univer-
sity handball title by defeating
Witkowski and Ehrlich 21-7, 21-7.
In the playoff for third place,
Hendrickson and Taylor easily
defeated Phi Kappa Sigma, the
lone fraternity survivor.

The uncanny back hand shots of
Silverman and the vicious place-
ments of Goodfiianmowed down
all opposition. The Mac duo, upon
entering the semi-finals, walloped
Sigma Nu, last year’s champs 21-2,
21-3, and Henrickson and Taylor
21-9, 21-10. The singles tourna-
ment is no wbeing run off and the
champion will probably be deter-
mined by the end of netx week.

MAROONS BRING

VICTORIES HOME

Tennis Team Only . Local
Loser Last Saturday

Featured by the strong showing
of the track, and golf teams, which
walloped Purdue and Iowa, respect-
ively, the last week-end turned out
more successful than was predicted.
The victory of Illinois over the ten-
nis team was all that marred Maroon
teams from making a clean sweep.

McKinney, by copping three firsts
and a second for a total of eighteen
points was the big factor in Chi-
cago’s 79 to 56 victory over the
1 Boilermakers. McKinney broke the
tape in the 100, 120 yard high hur-
dles, came in second and in the 220
low hurdles and won the broad jump.
Anton Burg, as usual walked off with
the high jump with a leap of 6 feet
2 1-2 inches. Capt. Cusack reeled off
the 440 in 55 and two-fifths but was
defeated by Little, the Hoosier ace
in the half mile for the third team
this year in the fast time of 1:58.
Scabinger was first in the javelin,
while Buck OIwin won the discus
throw for the second time with Stan
Rouse second. Morrison, a newcom-
er, showed good form to win the low
hurdles and add to the Maroon total
in the unexpected victory.

The crack Maroon golfers out-
classed Iowa 15 to 6 with Art Patter-
son shooting a 73 on the par course
of 70 for the best score of the day.
The other members of the Maroon
team were Capt. Ken Hisert, John
Bartlett and Jack Dorsey.

HISERT, BARTLETT,
PATTERSON TAKE

MORNING ROUND

Maroons Lead 9-3 Before
Afternoon Play

Begins

Maroon golfers, led by Captain
Kenny Hisert, defeated the strong
Boilermaker four, 11-9, yesterday
morning and afternoon at Olympia
Fields course number 4. The home
boys took three of the four individ-
ual matches, J. Dorsey being the
only individual loser of the day. The
team matches weren’t so successful
from the Maroon standpoint, however
as the Maroons lost one and halved
the other.

Maroons Win In Morning

In the morning play the Midway-
ites had it all their own way. Cap-
tain Hisert, playing number one, de-
feated C. Freidlin, taking both nines
and the match and counting three
points for his squad. Johnny Bart-
lett repeated the feat of his captain,
winning over J. Lehman and annex-'
ing three points.

Art Patterson also made three
markers for the locals, beating Ed.
Murphy, both out and in in the proc-
ess, while Dorsey was losing to Al
Aidringer by the same score. This
left the Maroons in the lead by a
nine to three score after the morning
round.

Almost Lose Meet

After lunch and a brief rest the
gruelling grind began once more, but
now the locals seemed to weaken. Pat-
terson and Dorsey, playing together,
dropped four points to the Murphy-
Aldringer combine. The Maroon
team took the first nine in the match
but fell down after the turn and
lost the in round and the match by
four points. This left the meet at
9-7 in favor of the hosts.

In the deciding match of the day,
Freidlin and Lehman took the out
round to tie the score at nine all. It

Manuel Gamio, Mexican anthropol-

which they are to deal, we shall have
made a great contribution toward
the solving of our alien problems.’’
