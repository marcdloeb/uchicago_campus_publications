Mussolini’s reorganization of the
Italian senate is the culminating
triumph of militant, imperialistic and
dictatorial Facism, and marks the
overthrow of parliamentary govern-
ment in Italy, according to Prof.
Arthur P. Scott, University historian.
In a radio talk from The Daily News
station, WMAQ, Prof. Scott analyzed
the political moves which led to the
Italian dictator’s latest startling in-
novation.

“Parliamentary government such
as we know it today is done for,”

Banquets, teas, and mixers,—
these may feature Maroon Week in
the eyes of the general public, but
the Whistle feels its privilege and
duty to make a unique contribution
to the campus—a constitution fdr
the Whistle Club, recently recog-
nized as an official campus organiza-
tion.

Terrible Turk (Leo Stone) reports
on the progress of his wits with great
pride and enthusiasm. “We have
had our picture taken,” says he; “we
have had meetings; we have accepted
and rejetced sundry invitations; and
now we reach the ultimate in organ-
ization—by-laws, and things like
that.” The constitution was ratified
at a recent meeting.

Constitution of the Whistle Club.

Article I. Description.

A. The name of this organization
shall be the Whistle Club, a local
organization of the University of
Chicago, affiliated with the staff of
The Daily Maroon. B. The emblem
of the Whistle Club shall be a whis-
tle, to be individually purchased by
members. C. The financial obliga-
tions will be assessments, agreed to
by the body, to be levied for cover-
ing current expenses, such as costs
of various functions, entertaining,
etc.

Article II. Purpose.

FROSH-SOPH HOP
TICKETS NEARLY
GONE, SAYS HEAD

Predict Sale of Entire
Quota by This
Afternoon

Three hundred couples, with not more
than one upperclassman in each pair, will
attend the annual Freshman-Sophomore
Prom tomorrow evening from 9 to 1
at the Chicago Beach hotel. Ticket sales
to date have warranted the prediction of
Paul Lewis, president of the Sophomore
class, that the quota of tickets will be
sold by this afternoon.

The chief officers of the Sophomore
and Freshman classes will lead the prom.
Paul Lewis, president of the Sophomore
class, and Helen King, vice president,
will lead one wing, and George Poole,
president of the Freshman class, and
Janet Goode, vice president, will lead
the other. These four officers are in
charge of the arrangements for the an-
nual dance.

O’Hare To Furnish Music

Husk O’Hare and his thirteen piece
Casino Club orchestra has been engaged
to furnish the music for the affair. The

All campus artists have been in-
vited to participate in this contest,
which will close Thursday, April 15.
The winning designs will be used ia

which sums up the whole situation
according to last night’s speaker.

Tells of Fascism

Fascism, violently attacked and as
fanatically defended, arose from the
post-war chaos in Italy, the Univer-

। sity historian said. It represented
the middle class desire for law and

tion. Further information may be
obtained from Paul Cullom, Phil

Kappa Psi house.

START EXPERIMENTS
IN UNCOMPLETED
LABORATORY

Staff members and graduate students
have already started scientific experi-
ments in the still unfinished Whitman
Zoological laboratory at Ingleside ave-
nue and 57th street. The money for the
building was given by Prof, and Mrs.
Frank Lillie, and named Whitman Zoo-
logical laboratory in commemoration of
the first head of the department of Zo-
ology in the University. The greater
part of the equipment of the laboratory
has been furnished by Prof. Lillie, the
rest having been removed from the old
zoology building and the greenhouses.

The facilities of the laboratory are now
being utilized by fourteen people of the
University. All the plumbing in the
structure has been worked in ^le open
so that it can easily be repaired or re-
modeled to order to keep the facilities
of the laboratory up-to-date.

The equipment of the building in-
cludes a refrigerator machine, which is
connected with one large refrigerating
room as well as two temperature humid-
ity control rooms, where the temperature
and humidity can be kept constant. The
equipment also includes a large experi-
mental dark room and a photographical
room.

the Students’ Theological association.

According to announcement of the
Social committee of the organization,
the tea is being given in an effort to
give new student and faculty mem-
bers the opportunity to become ac-
quainted with veteran members of the
school. So that their aim may be ac-

urged everyone to come out to wel-

JUDGE MARKS TALKS
ON SYNAGOGUE AT
MEETING

Judge Robert Marks, a parner in the
law firm of Aaron Sapiro, will discuss
“What’s Wrong with the Synagogue,”
at the meeting of the Jewish Students’
organization today at 4:30 in Classics 10.
Judge Marks, formerly of Ohio, is now
permanently located in Chicago and oc-
cupies a leading position at the bar here.

The remainder of the meeting will be
devoted to organizing the club and elect-
ing officers. The organization committee
will report on the work done during the
past quarter and will also make its
recommendation for a new and perma-
nent name for the association.

The nominating committee, composed

of Leo Stone, chairman, Harry

members-at-large, Lawrence
Paul Leffman and Violet

Non-fraternity men, and graduate stu-
dents may obtain bids from any of the
four leaders.

The Daily Maroon is issuing a special
number, as it did at the Washington
Prom, to serve as a program. This edi-
tion will be passed out as the couples
enter the ball room.

Dance To Be Formal

Evening clothes will be worn, as is
traditional at this affair. The leaders
have promised that the ball room will
be decorated in a lavish manner and that
different colored lights will be used for
effect.

There will be no guests of honor at
the affair, and University men are re-
quested to escort campus women. As
was announced in yesterday’s issue of
The Daily Maroon the leaders are not in
favor of stage celebrities or celebrities-
to-be as partners for campus men at-
tending the Prom. These it will be re-
membered were features of the Wash-
ington Prom. It is hoped that the affair
will be an exclusively campus dance.

As it is a Freshman-Sophomore affair,
it is expected that these classes will be
represented in every couple, said Helen
King, vice president of the Sophomore
class and one of the Prom leaders.

No supper will be seryed, according to
Lewis, who declared that it is not tra-
ditional to serve supper at junior college
dances. The patrons and patronesses
will be announced in tomorrow’s issue of
The Daily Maroon.

Ask Ticket Returns

Th^ Prom leaders are especially
anxious to hear from the fraternities
who have not as yet made returns on
their ticket allotments.’ It is necessary
that unsold tickets be reurned as soon
as possible in order that they may be
resold, as it is expected that the sup-
ply which the Prom leaders now have
on hand will fall far short in meet-
ing the demand today and tomorrow.

GIVE CONGREGATIONAL
CLUB MASQUE PARTY

As an opening social event of the quar-
ter, members of the Congregational club
have planned a masquerade party to be
held tonight at 8 in the Seminary, at
1165 E. 58th street. Congregational stu-
dents and faculty members have been
invited to attend this affair in costume.

“It is hoped that by having an infor-
mal party of this sort at the beginning
of the quarter, new members will become
acquainted with old ones at the offset,”
said Albert A. Walker, president of the
organization. “We hope that a large
number will take advantage of this op-
portunity to attend a get-together party.”

THE WORLD OR NOT THE WORLD?

/COLLEGE is made of two ingredients. One tends to link it with
the outside world; the other tends to isolate it.

First, there are the unworldly parts of college, the things that
separate it from bank and factory. We do, say, think, read, and
wear things that no business man would understand. We ourselves
can not understand them five years hence. We try to be a race
apart. We take care that our clothes shall differ a little from the
lawyer’s or the shoe salesman s. We often live in quarters more
luxurious than our lodgings will be five years hence. We study
courses in the grammar, the technique, the mechanics of living, rather
than in living itself. We concern ourselves about football, class
elections, plays, and publications that may imitate the outer world,
but try primarily to make college a world by itself. We live here
not the life to which we were born, nor the life to which we shall
graduate. We relish this difference. We are a chosen band because
we insist on being one.

Then, there are parts of college life that join it to the rest of the
world. College seeks means of preparing us for life, and sometimes
hits upon the idea of teaching us what life is. So we have courses
in the social sciences, courses in the literatures that record other
men's hopes and fears, courses that teach us to speculate. We meet,
at alumni reunions, those who have lived in the great world, besides
going to college in our little world. Our braver comrades sometimes
work in steel mills, or travel on cattle-boats. The loaning-officer
and the publicity-writer seldom have such adventures. They are
reserved for us in college, and make us a part of the world.

Both these factors serve their purpose in our training. We can not
call one artificial and the other real. Both are real to us. One
teaches us what life is, and so teaches us to live. The other imitates
life—plays at living—and it too (at least sometimes) teaches us to
live. Men who climb high in Activities often climb high in Business
—though some of them go broke. The insular parts of college are
sometimes meaningless; but often they have a close connection with

The unlucky thing is that they have not always that connection.

Could we not sift the worthwhile from the worthless? Could we
not check over some of our activities, and our habits, and keep only
those that have real experience in them? A reasonable amount of
play will keep Jack College from being a dull boy; but too much
play, or play taken too seriously, will never make him a man.

way for abolishing the lower house
of the Italian parliament, and marks
Mussolini’s consolidation of power.

Defends Italy

“We must realize that our parti-
cular form of constitutional govern-
ment may not be the most satisfac-
tory for other nations,” warned Prof.
Scott. Italy which has known hardly
more than two generations of parlia-
mentary rule, is not deeply welded to
representative government. The par-
tisan nature of the arguments for
and against the Fascist dictatorship
make it difficult to determine whether
this sort of leadership is proving suc-
cessful.

The reorganization of the senate,
Prof. Scott said, leaves Mussolini in
full control of the state, with an ad-
visory body composed of representa-
tives from various industries. It is
the latest of a series of moves lead-
ing to complete dictatorship. Earlier
innovations were the election law
which gave a two-thirds representa-
tion in parliament to the party which
obtained a majority at the polls, an
act making the premier responsible
to the king and not to the parliament,

AS MANAGER OF

Arnold Johnson Is Named
Assistant; Appoint

New Staff

John Howe will be manager of the
spring athletic program arranged by
the Intramural department, it was
announced yesterday. He will be
assisted by Arnold Johnson. They
will manage the big Spring Festival,
the tennis and playground ball sched-
oles with aid from a new staff. It
is the policy of the Intramural de-
partment to have complete staffs for
each of the fall, winter and spring
quarters.

Very Successful

Thus far, the staffs have succeeded
in turning in the best results ever
attained in the history of the depart-
ment, there being unusually small
confusion during the fall and winter
campaigns. Through efficient man-

I-M Officials Ask

For “Ball” Umpires

With the coming of spring, if
it ever does come, intramural
baseball will start. Already Wood-
lawn and University Avenues are
blocked -by fraternity men out
limbering up with bat and ball and
as soon as the snow clears away
things will get going in the usual
spring manner. The I. M. office
has its schedule almost completed
and soon the announcements will
be on the way to the various
houses.

But again the old problem of
umpires presents itself to the offi-
cials. So they ask that any men,
who are interested in umpiring
these games, leave their name and
phone number with Bill King at
the Alpha Sigma Phi house at
5635 University Avenue. The
telephone number is Dorchester
1357.

Experience is not a requirement
but the men must of course be up
on the latest rules for play. Last
year’s men are especially urged
to turn in their names.

IOWA NINE TRAVELS
SOUTH FOR PRACTICE

Iowa City, Iowa, April 7.—Coach Otto
Vogel and his baseball squad slipped out
of town Thursday for a retreat from
the mid-winter blizzard. The first game
against St. Louis University was can-
celled because of bad weather and the
Hawkeyes continued south to a warmer
zone in Mississippi.

Vogel has eight men of experience left
from last year’s team, Capt. Flinn, Mc-
Nabb, Sahs and Beardsley, outfielders;
Hoben, first baseman; Smith, third base-
man; Miller, catcher, and Adams, pitcher.
The biggest losses by graduation were
Scantlebury, shortstop, and Miller,
pitcher, the two best ball players of last
year’s team.

Smith has been moved from third base
to shortstop to fill Scantlebury’s shoes
and McNabb has been pulled in from the
outfield to play third base. Hoben is a
fixture at first, but second base is still
open for the best of a flock of new men.

PLAY OFF HANDBALL
FINALS NEXT WEEK

Handball will make its exit from the
annals of winter sports next weey when
the finals of the Intramural tournament
will be held. Lambda Chi Alpha, Alpha
Delta Phi, Tau Sigma Omicron, and Phi
Kappa Sikma will meet in the cham-
pionship games.

The games will be held in the Stadium
courts. They will be the last winter
sporting events. Although the matches
have failed to attract outside interest,
the players themselves are hugely en-
grossed in them.

Have Advantage of Orient
Trip of Last Fall

Undaunted by the miserable weather
that has confronted them for the last
two weeks, the best Maroon diamond
squad since the war is working out
daily in Bartlett Gym. under the
watchful gaze of Coach Norgren. I n-
abfc to make a Southern trip as many
other Big Ten schools do the Maroon
nine has the advantage of the trip to
the Orient. As soon as the ground
permits, the team will work outdoors
to prepare for the opening game with
Purdue at Lafayette on April 20.

Have Title Hopes

The hopes for the title arc even bet-
ter than last year, when the Midway-
ites lost the bunting by one run. Only
(’apt. Red Cunningham, Bill Weiss,
and John and Bob Howell will be
missing from last year’s team. Fight-
ing for the berth left vacant by Cun-
ningham. will he Roy Price, a beauti-
ful fielding first baseman but slight-
ing weak on hitting, and John Mc-
Donough. the cage star. At the key-
stone sack, where Bob Howell per-
formed so capably for the last three
years, will find keen competition with
Chuck Hoeger being given the edge
unless some of the new comers show
unexpected form.

McConnell At Short

The veteran McConnell will work at
short with the hard hitting Claude
Brignail at the third sack. Wallie
Marks and Joe Gubbins, two of the
best pitchers in the Big Ten are back,
and will be given assistance by Mack-
lind who also works in the outfield.
Webster, who handled the backstop-
ping last year will also do the catch-
ing again, assisted by Benton.

Outfield Strong

Norgren has some fleet and experi-
enced outfielders although he will miss
the spectacular 'atches of John How-
ell and Weiss. Russell Pierce, Bill
Macklind, and Wallie Marks form a
dependable trio. From last ysar’s frosh
Norgren will have George Lott, pitch-
er; Zimmerman, outfielder; Gordon,
a flashy short stop; and Kyle Ander-
son.

phia to for the Penn Relays, which
have not been missed by Chicago
teams for the past twenty-six years.
The University was the first western
team to take part in the affair and has
been one of the biggest factors in
making it a national event. Also Chi-
cago has won seven Penn Relays,
more than any other team, with the

exception of course of Pennsylvania
self.

THE GRID SITUATION
AT THE MIDWAY; IS
IT AS BAD AS THIS?

“The football situation at Chicago next
fall will test the ability of the ‘Old Man’,”
is the gist of one of the leading articles
of the last issue of the Big Ten Weekly.
The article which is in the nature of a

teen thousand strong, turned out and met
the victorious athletes at tly? train. With
triumphant pride swelling high, they
gave the lads a moster ovation and swept
them up into a parade which soon grew
to be three miles in length with the
school children in the lead. They took
the boys back to their old school and
staged a demonstration that was truly
remarkable. Citizen after citizen rose
and praised the returned heroes in the
most glowing terms at their disposal
and then in the midst of continuous cheers
Captain Myllykangas and his coach
brokenly expressed their appreciation of
all that the town folk had done for them,
tor the expenses for the trip had been
defrayed by popular subscription. Then
the team was preesnted with a large lov-
ing cup by the citizens.

First Victory

All this because Fitchburg for the first
time in the history of the Interscholastic
had carried the national championship

Many Local Prep Stars
To Compete In

Big Meet

The Eighth Interscholastic afforded
campus students a chance to see the
fleetest floor-game performers of the
country in action. Swim fans are
clamoring for an opportunity to view
budding fin-strokers in their moist
environment: ’tis with this reason in
mind that Coach Mac Gillivray has
invited nearby teams to participate in
the coming splash meets that are to
be held in the Bartlett Natatorium.
Whilst the Basketball tourney drew
teams from coast to coast, the greater
part of the swim entries are of urban
glory, all the swimmers having com-
peted in meets in Chicago or its “en-
virons.”

Entry blanks have been pouring
rapidly into the hands of Harry Rit-
tenhouse and Eddy Fellinger who
have charge of the managing end of
the contest. Both of these Maroon
stars have high hopes for the turn out
of swimmers this Friday and Saturday
nites, and expect to see many flashy
local geniuses struggle for individual
and team honors.

Peterson To Star

Dick Peterson, mighty breastroker
from Lindblom High, is expected to
carry away all honors in his event. He
holds a never ending string of records,
and having outdistanced Eddy Len-
nox, former national high school cham-
pion, should finish in the lead with
ease. K. Mygdal, a youngster at
Shurtz, and by the way a brother of
our star breastroker, has followed his
brother’s footsteps and is turning cut
some fast time in the frog-kick strug-
gles.

L. Koibath, far famed former of
fancy forms is to grace the spring
board event. Koibath is a national
known diver, bepmg considered one
of the best in High School circles.

they had not deserved it, for in addition
to coming to paly in the basket tourney,

feels that it has a just right to be proud
of its team.

“Perhaps not in recent years in Confer-

to start to build so completely from the
ground up, excepting at Illinois in 1922
when Bob Zuppke had only three “I”/
men to start the season, and those' three
were practically substitutes from the
previous season.”

It says in regard to Duval. “The deck
is set for Duval to make a name for
himself at quarterback. This kid can
throw passes, bitt he had no chance last
year. He was sent in a few times in
deep mud in desperation during the final
quarter and tried a few from standing

stands knew what he was ‘in there’ for
The opposing teams knew it best of all.

One Buck to a Pretty Girl— 3 Months' Subscription to the Maroon
Supplement to

The Daily Maroon

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 1926

WHAT ITS ABOUT

‘rhaps we had better explain, first
of all, what this is intended to be.

It is not a magazine. You have
noticed that already, no doubt. What
you have before you is no disciple
of Scribner, Knopf, or Conde-Nast;
much less does it set itself up as
Something New. Glance up at the
title: “Supplement to The Daily
Maroon.” That, reader, is what you
are reading.

The Daily Maroon is a publication
of great caprice and irregularity. It
is entertaining and dull, solemn and
flippant, intelligent and meaningless,
good and bad, by turns. It avoids
formality; it does not know how to
remain stationary. When its editors
have an idea, they do not presume
to decide whether the idea be good
or bad. They try it. That, say they,
is the only way to find out. So we
have searched for a college Apollo
and bombardments upon the under-
graduate council, bobbing up among
duller and sounder copy.

With this same disregard of law,
this same liking for a gambler’s
chance, The Daily Maroon now
plunges into untried waters. It may
stomp, some afternoon, into the po-
lite drawing-room of Mme. Phoenix,
nee Circle; but that is not its chief
purpose. It proposes to invade the
realms of literature, opinion, and the
aits (seven of them, we believe).
And it proposes to use the tactics,
not of a magazine or a term-paper
or a manual of instructions, but of
The Daily Maroon.

So we members of the American
Universities are the final, highly pol-
ished product of an ultra-modern
civilization! A pleasing conceit, but
fortunately, untrue. Instead we lay
claim by our actions to the title of
anachronism. Our century is not the
early Twentieth, but the late Seven-
teenth. And, further, we are of Eng-
land, rather than of America.

“In England, 1660 marked a rather
wide adoption, toward life in gen-
eral, of that attitude which, as dis-
tinguished from the Chivalrous view,
is describable as Gallantry. I have
read that the secret of Gallantry is
to accept the pleasures of life lei-
surely, and its inconveniences with a
shrug; as well as that, among other
requisites, the gallant person will al-
ways consider the world with a smile
of toleration and his own doings with
a smile of honest amusement, and
Heaven with a smile which is not dis-
trustful,— being thoroughly persuad-
ed that God is kindlier than the
genteel would regard as rational.

“In fine, the gallant person is a
well-balanced sceptic, who compre-
hends that he knows very little, and
probably amounts to somewhat less,
but has the grace to keep his tem-
per . . .”

AFTER hearing a hearty lecture
on The Study of Celtic Liter-
ature and enjoying a meal at the
Berghof restaurant where a two inch
collar of foam embraces a glass of
less than one-ljalf of one per cent
beer, I climbed the stairway of an
elevated station and waited for a
train. Visions of the evening were
depicted in my mind as the coach
throbbed and bumped over the rails
. . . there were heaps and heaps of
words, meaningless words; and there
was a spotted menu with calves liver
and pig knuckles advertised at thirty-
five cents a plate. It behooves me to
elaborate upon the pig knuckles that
I ordered . . . large, well-boiled ones
with plenty of meat and a great deal
more fat; fat with the tissue efficient-
ly torn apart by hours of stiff boiling.
They were a rarity and a delicacy
for one who cares for such fatty stuff,
and I being not of the Celts but of
the rubicund Teutons do like lim-
hurger cheese, sauer kraut and goose,
Lager beer, and pig knuckles. So it
was-that I had visions of more pig
knuckles instead of more knowledge
of Celtic mannerisms when I left the
train at Hawthorne.

of goodness and badness that you pos-

PSYCHOPATWA

We shall use the anonymity this
column affords as we see fit. In othcr
words, we shall very freely dispense
our own ideas. We shall never feel
it to be necessary to apologize for
any sentiment expressed in this col-
umn. In short, we are proud of our
depravity.

We are certain of ourself -and our
line. Until a short time ago we be-
lieved that there did not exist a
woman whom we couldn’t overcome
with uninteresting ease in a contest
of wits, but now we’re not so sure.
We might easily be the loser in a
bout with the charming lady who was
in a class with us last quarter. Dur-
ing a discussion of Art, in which the
instructor unburdened himself of
several amusing platitudes, she smiled
up at him and said sweetly, “Profes-
sor, won’t you give us your views on
theology? They ought to be inter-
esting, too.” The poor man was flab-
bergasted.

The big blond boy who had flunked
out of an Eastern gentleman’s finish-
ing school and who tarried but short-
ly at our own noble institution of
learning, gave us much amusement.
Three times a week he would drop
into our room after we had retired
for the night, sit down heavily on
that part of the anatomy immediate-
ly below the solar plexus, and breathe
sweet essence of juniper in our face.
Then he would recount the evening’s
pleasure. His proudest boast was that
he had drunk the president of the
local chapter of Kappa Beta Phi (yes,
there is such an organization here)
under the table.

But in a moment of weakness he
confided that he was not as old as
he looked, but was only eighteen,
nor was he the man of the world he
sounded, for he was exceedingly
bashful in the presence of girls.

We should describe him as typical-
ly collegiate.

We are told that girls at North-
western are expelled if caught smok-
ing. We wonder what penalty the

By devious routes a story told on
himself by a well-known professor
reaches us. It appears that he deliv-
ered a course of lectures at his Alma
Mater in the East, and at the con-
clusion of the series gave a summary
of his attitude toward life and lit-
erature. When he was through, a
young man said, “Professor, do you
really believe in the utterly childish
philosophy you have just expounded?
We, the members of the class, con-
sider it a direct insult to our intelli-
gence to be asked to believe that any
apparently intelligent adult believes
as you say you do.”

Draw your own conclusions.

Higher salaries for instructors? Of
course. Let the University continue
on' its path, the ultimate goal of
which is the formation of an Old
Maids* Home. Except for the few
outstanding exceptions (who are al-
ways pointed at with pride) the vari-
ous faculties are made up, for the
most part, of mentally under-devel-
oped products of American graduate
schools. Contemplation of the grad-
uates working for higher degrees at
the University of Chicago, one of
the best graduate schools in the
country, will show the poor material
from which our teachers are se-
lected.

MEMOIRS OF A

CHORUS LADY

I.	I Begin My Education

Someone is always asking me to
tell about my experiences on the
stage th? minute they hear me men-
tion the fact that I have been there.
To tell the truth, I never mention it
unless it just happens to come up in
the conversation, because I am not
so proud of it since my aunt raved
so. She said that it was a pity that
I had used my own name because my
wealthy relative did not approve ot
people with theatrical backgrounds
or of people who had any back-
ground whatever. She always has
said that one should never get one’s
name in the paper or come before
the eyes of the public, that a true
lady is always inconspicuous and in
the background. As far as I am con-
cerned, though, I wouldn’t be a wall-
flower for anybody, and, besides, it
wouldn’t have done any good be-
cause I was already into it before I
knew that she wouldn’t like it. Well,
that’s enough about the family’s atti-
tude on the subject, except that my
mother said hat she knew it wouldn’t
do any good to tell me not to do it
because I had always done exactly
as I_pleased, anyway, and when I
talked to my father on the Ouija
board he said that I should finish my
education. Of course, he wasn’t in
any position to stop me if I wanted
tp do it, so I did.

T had always been dancing around
at the Woman’s Club, the Rotary,
and Kiwanis banquets, and Campfire
girls entertainments in the small
town where I was born. Everyone
told my parents that I had great
talent and that it was a pity I could-
n’t go to the city to study. Well,
my mother and I called their bluff
and when my father died, we did.
That is, she went first to get settled
and left me at a rooming house at
home. I certainly had a good time
when she had gone. A boy and I
used to do exhibition dances at the

A BEWITCHED

STORY-TELLER

The Baron Sets Forth a New
Theory About Hawthorne
and His Mystic Ladies

Within the confines of my cham-
ber you will meet my fascinating
friend, Steen Helmar, Baron D’Onge,
whom you may, perchance, have
seen in the late afternoon gliding
nonchalantly about the Chateau Ma-
drid. “Le Baron,” of Belgian birth,
is pleasingly tall, of arrogant face,
and extraordinarily charming of de-
meanor which he exerts in favor of
the American heiress and, in a meas-
ure, becomes a Scylla for any who
chance the Parisian shores. He is
lavishly egocentric and not unintelli-
gently so, but the gift which endears
him to me has made him the paragon
of liars.

The Baron arrives and slides him-
self onto a well-cushioned couch.

. ‘‘Why the scowl, ‘Stenie,’ ” say I.

“I’ve just discovered an extraordi-
nary woman from out of that God-
forsaken West of yours!”

“Marry her.”— emphatically.

“I can’t. She’s like all the rest of
the interesting women in the world
and has no money.”

“Where did you find the marble?”
asks the Baron finally, picking up a
little statue of a faun and juggling
it indecorously.

“An old woman with a dreamy
Spanish shawl sells them near the far
end of the Pont Sully. Remembered
a novel of Hawthorne’s and bought
it the other day. Ever read him?”

“Me? O yes. I know all about
Hawthorne.”

“Personal friend, ‘Stenie’?”

A moon cloud smile glimmers
across his face, but he goes right on.

“My grandfather knew and enter-
tained him during his sojourn in
Italy. The old man is dead now some
years, but I remember queer recol-
lections of his association with the
author. As the story goes, some
worthy sire of Hawthorne’s held a
judgeship in the queer fishing port

of Salem, surrounded by a people
whom I smile to say were no less
credulous than our transatlantic vis-
itors are today. Certainly there re-
mains in the law annals of that town
the record of the condemnation of
a number of women who were burned
for being versed in witchcraft. One
of these was a young woman of And-
over, who, perhaps, because of her
remarkable beauty and a mystic
sympathy with an alien God, was
brought before the venerable Judge
as an uncomplacent figure in a Puri-
tan wilderness. Although the rec-
ords themselves are scant in descrip-
tion, the story has been handed down
how she, having faced her accusers
with a strange and superluminary
dispassionateness, placed a curse on
the grey head, who, in the misguided
light of his time, sentenced her two

small children with the memory of a
sorely persecuted mother.

“Now Hawthorne, as be discreetly
told my grandfather, believed strong-
ly in the transmigration of the soul
and the hereditary guidance of a
spirit for good or evil. As strange
as it may seem, it has been believed
that this celebrated genius wps do-
ing a penance for his grandfather’s
soul. The driving force which came
from unviolated solitude, the almost
unnatural loveliness of his tone qual-
ities, the unfathomable well from
which he drew his rare occultism, all
bespeak an untangible connection
with a hidden past.

friend, but have you ever noticed
that most striking female character
who invades so many 'of his stories:

more and more what the

are sold; an institution to
encourage the appreciation
of literature and the buying
of good books by the stu-
dents. Its recent changes in
the arrangement of the book
section and its policy of
keeping in stock the best of
the new Action are doing
their part to perform these
most important functions of
a college bookstore. It is a
Ane idea to encourage stu-
dents to come in and browse
around.”

that Chuck knows what he’s
talking about!

ter, Miriam? These denizens of a
semi-mystic world who, in the same
way, seem beautiful and inexpressi-
bly terrible. What of Beatrice with
‘a voice as rich as a tropical sunset,
and which made Giovanni, though
he knew not why, think of deep hues
of purple or crimson and of perfume
heavily delectable?’ Whence came
the ‘deep black eyes’ and dark hair
of Hester Prynne? Who had 'a com-

you might look as deeply as your
glance would go, and still be con-
scious of a depth that you had not

she vanquished Holfernes with her
beauty, and slew him for too much

“Zenobia drowned, Beatrice pois-
oned with an antitoxin, and Ayl-

have allowed Hawthorne to entice me
with his subtle simplicity along the
uncaressing curves of his catacombs
of esoteric fancy, I wonder if I, too,
have not caught the contagion of his
curse. I have seen a vision of a
woman standing on my- hearthstone,
dressed in vermillion velvet trimmed ;
in cloth of gold around the wrists
and neck. Her hair was a shineless
black that stole away in gentle waves
across her ears. She smiled at me
one long and penetrating smile which
seemed to drag me from the shades
of reverie, and after she had left,
there was a faint odor of Eastern
perfume like the air around the fra-
grant spice wharves of the Jewish
merchants. It may be that time and
too much thinking on this vision caste
in female figure has rendered my own
sensibilities tender to the sight of
her translucent touches in the face
of others. Within the hour, I tell
you, I have seen a face which made
me tremble, run away, and now re-
turn.”

of lime-dust floats undisturbedly

good and they were just jealous, the
same as they were when I finally ar-

the chorus. They all said nothing
good could come of that. But it did,
because I travelled a lot and learned

young girls should know.

Finally my mother sent for me to

the high from the lowly. . . there are
brilliant ribbons that men wear
across their breasts, and wooden
shoes that others fit upon their feet.
There, on the Continent, the peoples
have learned through sufficient revo-
lutions that there is no such thing as
equality, be it material wealth, men-
tality, social prestige or political I
bungling. The Continental peasant
simply fought to get the heel from off
of his throat, and when it was re-
moved and he could breathe, he really
did not care upon what part of his
anatomy the heel rested. In America,
however, the natives fought for the
amputation of the heel; they wanted
to be sure that it was gone, i. e., they
wanted all heels removed but their
own. And so it has come about in
America that men are not known by
their ribbons or their wooden shoes,
but by the size of their heels.

I HAVE often visited a flour mill
where with the taking of several
steps I could first handle the wheat as
it flowed into the stone mills and then
the white flower where it left the
whirling reels. .The flour, I was told,

PARTING

No word so sweet as when we
said

Just “au revoir” and not ‘'good-
bye.”

No winding pathway ever led
To vistas quite so far and high.

Those promise-words when spoken
low

Make dreams most dully-colored
things,

Two heads are after held just so,
One heart, at least, with laughter
sings.

was made by a patent process that
had proved to be an economical
method ... a saver of money and
labor. Day after day the mills of the
flour company turn; day after day,
grains of wheat, peculiarly different
from one another, are “processed” in-
to flour that has nothing more than
the individuality of flour. I find that
I cannot blame the mill owners be-
cause they manufacture flour that is
identically the same, day after day.
They would change their product but
they are prohibited . . . flour is flour
... it little concerns the makers of
pure food laws what the housewife
does with the millers’ product. And
so when I hear a university student
complain of the system in which he
has been placed or into which he
placed himself, I am not prone to
sympathize with his miserable war-
whooops. He, it seems to me, is no
other than the kernel that endeavors
to leap from the spout ... he is
afraid of the milling process that is
to come.

But the milling process of the uni-
versity is not equipped with kernel
tight spouts . . . men and women,
unlike kernels of wheat, are made the
victims of their brains. There are op-
portunities and opportunities for the
I human kernels to escape the crunch-
ing of the mills . . . and from the
quantity of wheat that arrives at this
mill it is pitiful, indeed, to see the lit-
tle flour that flows from the finishing
reels. The directors of a flour mill
can figure their pronts and loss for

COLLEGE; A PARAPHRASE
(Continued from page 1)

In* American Universities 1900
marked a rather wide adoption
toward life in general, of that atti-
tude which, etc. Why not? Do we,
while at school, consider life to be a
somber tragedy, or a realistic novel?
Why, not a whit. It is a grand com-
edy, wherein all the parts are cast
for our special delectation. We are
momentarily scholars, and politicians,
and athletes, and men of the world,
and esthetes. Do we not accept our
pleasures leisurely, and surely out
inconveniences, classes, flunk notices
and such, we accept with a shrug.
But elsewhere in the creed of Gal-
lantry it is stated that in spite of
the comprehension of his general
worthlessness the gallant person will
admit to no one, and least of all to
himself, this fact. So we have an air
of fine sincerity about our fraterni-
ties, and our campus activities, and
our athletics, that defies attempts to
discover the true attitude.

As a parallel, the courtier of Wy-
cherley’s day was an expert at amor-
ous dalliance, a hard drinker, a vi-
cious fighter when necessary’, and not
seldom a fine scholar. He was con-
vincingly serious about all except his
last quality, which he hid quite care-
fully.

The gallant cavalier carefully
avoided the semblance of serious
thinkingly, but he could, and did, dis-
course charmingly of the writing of
his day, he knew the light music of
his contemporaries, he attended the
theatre religiously, and his table wit
has never been surpassed. In short
“of a gentleman it was everywhere
expected as the requisites of social
success, to make improper advances
gracefully; and to dress not more
than a month behind the Court of
Fontainebleau; and to fence well
enough to pink his man in an occa-
sional duel back of Montagne house;
and to say resistlessly in French that
which he ought not to say at all.”

The gallant collegiate would he
ostracized if it were known that he
considered his classes other than hor-
rible bores, but he does know the in-
consequential and some of the im-
portant writing now being done, he

talks understandingly, and with much
appreciation of Jazz, he has attended
most of the shows in town, and his
line is absolutely unique. In short,
of a college man it is everywhere ex-
pected, as the requisites of social suc-
cess, to use for indecent ends a line
whose charm is equalled only by its
effectiveness; and to dress not more
than a month behind Harvard and
Yale; and to be enough of an ath-
lete to make an occasional touch-
down; and to tell resistlessly stories
that he ought not to tell at all.

CIRCLE

Ah, there can be no silence half
so sweet

As that of our two footsteps on
the street.

Of half desire that we might be
more near;

Subdued bg dread that we’d no
longer hear

No hope is there that we mag be
again

/Is once we were, immersed in that
close pain

Our trembling voices waving
banal hands

From time to time the fingers
touching strands

Of feeling that we did not know
was there,

Bg those caressing fingers half
laid bare.

Betty Trimble.

Furthermore, of Congreve’s wom-
en it is said, “For they are in every-
thing pre-eminently adorable, these
mendacious, subtle, pleasure loving,
babbling, generous, volatile, brave,
witty, and sumptuous young jill-
flirts who rule in the Utopia of Gal-
lantry. So all true cognoscenti must
stay forever enamored of them; of
their alert eyes, their little satin-slip-
pered feet, their saiicy tip-tilted little
noses, their scornful little carmine
mouths, ajid their glittering rest-
less little hands—for they are all
M ignonnes.” And there is the co-ed.
She, too, abides by the rules of Gal-

lantry, but with this difference. She
is never so misled by her emotions
that she forgets her creed; the men
sometimes are.

It is not, then, remarkable that the
true collegiate can be differentiated
not only from the callow freshYnan
who tries to copy his mannerisms, but
also from the clerk who carefully imi-
tates his clothes. The Alumnus, too,
is almost immediately distinguishable.
Unfortunately, Gallantry is always
left at the University when its fol-
lower leaves. It is a shining, vari-
colored garment that is worn for four
years and then forgotten except for
odd moments.

PIG KNUCKLES AND COLLEGE
(Continued from page 5)

the coming year . . . but the direc-
tors of a university, never.

^pHERE seems to be an American
desire to cultivate good taste in
the way that Mary learned to swim
?v being warned to stay out of the
'water. There seems to be a good
American myth that culture and good
taste is a little germ that innoculates
the student who spends four or more
years in the region of a university
or college. Yet, I have known good,
honest men and women who have
lived in a college town a life time . . .
but they never relinquished their de-
sire to eat pig knuckles and sauer
kraut. Intellectually, they never be-
came the elect, although they had
spent more years in the collegiate at-
mosphere than had any of the col-
lege’s alumni.

It seems strange that there has
grown in America a social* routine
that requires, at least, the entrance
to a first class college or university.
It is the thing to do ... to send
Ralph or Betty to the intellectual cen-
ters of the states and to wait for the
transformation. Automatically, they
become a Smith girl or a Harvard
man. And that title is enough to as-
sure them social prestige . . . who
cares what they really know . . .
who cares what they have actually
done . . . the deadly, vicious little
germ called Culture and Taste never
fails to produce a collegiate epidemic.

AND so it was as I left the ele-
vated train at Hawthorn that my
mind was filled with what I have just
written and my stomach with pig
knuckles and sauer kraut. Terrible!
I can hear from a thousand directions
. . . “Pig knuckles and sauer kraut”
in the same breath with “culture and
taste!” But I might as well admit
that I cannot afford to eat the swine
as it is served on the mahogany tables
of the Berghof restaurant ... it
was at a professor’s house that I ate
the hog ... a professor who is a
very demon when it comes to innocu-
lating those little germs called Cul-
ture and Taste. For over the dinner
table I smelled the odours of steam-
ing fat and tasted the cream of in-
tellectual discussion.
