Women’s Clubs Consider Plan for Third Year Rushing

GROUPS REVIEW

SENIOR COLLEGE
CLUB PROPOSAL

Mrs. Flint Explains Plan
As Originating In Inter-
Club Council

By MADGE C. CHILD

“The third year rushing plan, pro-
viding for senior college women’s
clubs, originated in the Inter-club
council and is in no way being im-
posed on by the faculty,” Mrs. Edith
Foster Flint, chairman of the Wom-
en’s University council, explained.
“The plan arose out of the deep dis-
satisfaction felt at the end of the
1925 rushing season, and must be ac-
cepted by all the clubs before it goes
into effect.”

A committee was appointed by Inter-
club council to consider ways and
means of doing away with the evils of
the ten day rushing system. This
committee asked Mrs. Flint, Mrs.
Robert V. Merrill, Social Directors,
and Miss Gertrude Dudley, director
of physical education, to assist them,
not in making out a new set of rush-
ing rules, but in evolving a scheme
wherein rushing, as such, could be
done away with.

Committee Explain* Plan

“The joint committee has been
working on the plan continuously
throughout the year, and has come to
the conclusion that senior college clubs
offer the best solution of the prob-
lem,” continued Mrs. Flint. “By sen-
ior college clubs, we mean that no
woman will be taken into a club until
the end of her sophomore year. In
this way, we hope to do away with
rushing. In the first place, I do not
believe it is humanly possible for any
group of girls to rush for two years,
and in the second place, a few days
of intensive rushing would not have
much effect on a woman who has been
on campus for two years.

The recent change made in the de-
tails of the plan came at the sugges-
tion of several club women. Accord-
ing to the new idea, pledging will take
place at the end of the third quarter
of the sophomore year instead of the
beginning of the junior year as pre-
viously decided.

State Pledging Requirement*

Upperclass women who have had
two years’ work in some other college,
regardless of the number of majors
advanced standing received, may, un-
der the proposed plan, be pledged at
the end of their first quarter. Women
entering with less than two years’
work will be pledged on the same
basis.

“There has been a rumor on cam-
pus,” said Mrs. Flint, “that by this
plan, the faculty hope eventually to
do away with clubs. Nothing could
be farther from the truth. Clubs will
gain in prestige and influence.”

“If this plan,” Mrs. Flint concluded,
“could be put through, originating, as
it did, in the women themselves, made
to spread by their efforts through
free discussion, and voted on by the
clubs as autononous bodies, it should
be regarded as a great triumph for
student broadmindedness, intelligence
and self-government.”

Autry, Freshman

Chairman, Takes

Role of Rescuer

When one is invited to a picnic
“just to be handy and fix tires,” it is
quite thrilling to change the prosaic
into the romantic.

Daniel Autry, president of the
Freshman Board of Management, had
such an experience last summer. It
was cold, too cold for swimming, but
someone convinced Daniel by calling,
“Come on in. You might have a
chance to save one of the girls from
drowning.”

Laughingly looking forward to the
possibilities, he plunged in. A few
minutes later there was a frantic call
for help. On of the girls was drown-
ing. When he got to the spot she
had already gone down twice. She
greeted him with a death grip—
Daniel hasn’t decided which yet. A
swim of some fifty feet, however,
brought the couple safely to shore.
And Daniel’s been recommended for
a Carnegie medal.

LIST SIXTEEN PHI

BETE UNDERGRADS

Meyer, Hahn, Smith and
Clemen* Head Group

Elections and graduation have left
sixteen members in the University
undergraduate Phi Beta Kappa.
Early in the quarter Albert Meyer
was elected president and Alice Hahn,
Ruth Clemens, and Cecil Smith were
chosen aiding executives.

. The present members of the organ-
ization are John Barnet, Ruth Clem-
ens, Helen Engle, Irene Erp, Herbert
Geisler, Arthur Giess, Alice Hahn,
Margaret ioatt, Morris Lipcovitz, Al-
bert Meyer, Eames Robinson, Harry
Ruskin, Cecil Smith, Samuel Spira,
Aliver Vogel, and Louise Watson.

MRS. M. LOGSDON TO
RETURN TO COLLEGES
AS DEAN, INSTRUCTOR

Mrs. Mayme Irvin Logsdon, a for-
mer Dean in the colleges at the Uni-
versity, will return next quarter to
take up her duties here. For the
past year and a half she has been
studying mathematics in Italy. Most
of her time was spent in Rome, ex-
cept for a brief visit in Greece at
Easter time.

Formerly Mrs. Logsdon held the
positions of Dean, Head of Green-
wood hall, the woman’s residential
hall across the Midway, and instruc-
tor in mathematics. She returns to
take up all of these duties.

Prof. F. J. Miller,
Early Instructor And

Dean Visits Campus

Professor Frank Justin Miller, one
of the first instructors in the Univer-
sity, has been back on campus for a
few days visiting old friends and
familiar places. He retired from his
duties as professor of Latin and Dean
in the colleges in the spring of 1925.

Foremost in the work which Pro-
fessor Miller did here are his trans-
lations of “Seneca’s Tragedies” and
“Ovid.” At the beginning of the next
semester, Professor Miller will teach
Latin at the University of loWa.

COUNCILS INSPIRE
CLASS SPIRIT BY

DINNERS, MIXERS

Senior* and Soph* Choose
Insignias; Juniors, Frosh

Still Unmarked

Luncheons, dinners, mixers and
class insignias as means of inspiring
class spirit have been planned by the
respective councils of the four
classes for the remainder of the
academic year.

Social life of the year was started
off with a bang by a completed re-
union of the whole Senior class at
a dinner, December 10, in the sun
parlor of Ida Noyes hall. Canes car-
ried by senior men on Thursdays,
Senior chapel day, have proven
Senior spirit.

The Junior class council has plan-
ned a luncheon for the first of next
quarter, the date to be announced
later. An all-University mixer will
be given by the Juniors Winter
quarter also.

Members of the Sophomore
council have devised something en-
tirely new at the University for their
class insignia. Crimson feathers,
ten inches long, to be worn in the
hats of sophomore men and women
alike, were sold in chapel last Tues-
day.

Daniel Autrey, chairman of the
Freshman Board of Management an-
nounces a Freshman party, today
from 7:30 to 10 in the sun parlor
and theater of Ida Noyes hall.

Does the “Chain'

And Bair Ball
Frighten Co-eds?

“Why are there so few engaged
girls on campus?” questions the
Buchtelite, official student newspaper
of the University of Akron.

“It is that the ball and chain at-
tachment doesn’t appeal to either
sex, or is the slogan of the modern
college woman, ‘Love Them AH’?”
asks the newspaper while searching
for the explanation of this strange
situation.

Headlines announcing that “Only
fourteen per cent of the women on
campus are wearing fraternity pins”
appeared in the daily. A census
taken by interested members of the
staff revealed that one sorority had
no engaged members while others
had very few.

The situation on the University
campus does not appear to be so de-
plorable however. While no actual
canvas has been made there are a
notable number of fraternity pins on
the dresses of campus women, parti-
cularly among the juniors and
seniors. Each June brings forth
campus couples who have decided to
tolerate each other for life, and, oc-
casionally an undergraduate pair
take the trek to the altar.

C. and A. Students
Hosts At Mixer

Students in the College of Com-
merce and Administration will be
hosts at an All-University mixer to-
day from 4 to 6 in Room 105 of the
C. and A. building. Dancing and re-
freshments have been planned under
the direction of Rachel Marshal.

Women’s Organizations Accomplish'
Aim of Campus Friendliness With

Quarter’s Programs and Projects

Programs and entertainments
given by each of the three women’s
organizations, Y. W. C. A., Federa-
tion, and W. A. A. have throughout
the quarter aimed, aside from fol-
lowing their individual projects, to
bring about a feeling of friendliness
between the women on campus.

Discussions which have been in the
nature of a preparation for the Na-
tional Council of Christian Associa-
tion have held the interest of the
first cabinet of L. W. C. A. The
women in their talks have attempted
to analize the campus situation to
see what relation religion has to
campus life.

Second Cabinet

Second cabinet which is made up
of a group of women who are active
on the various committees have been
for the first time concentrating on
studies of the personality of Jesus.

Federation’s function in campus
life has been more recessive than
active. During the autumn quarter
the organization has held five meet-
ings, at two of which the women dis-
cussed campus personalities and tfie
“Ints and Outs” of Ida Noyes. A
sing comprised one meeting in which
numerous University and college
songs were sung. The culmination
of the activities was in the form of a
banquet which was held in celebra-
tion of Federation’s one hundreth
open meeting.

W. A. A. planned its social activ-
ities either before or after the foot-
ball games. Torch, which to held
annually, was in the form of a pep
session preceding the Ohio game.
The night before the Northwestern
game was featured by the Chicago
Night banquet; and following an an-
nual custom, the members of W. A.
A. entertained the women from the
Wisconsin chapter at a luncheon pre-
ceding the Wisconsin game.

EL CIRCULO ESP ANOL
PRESENTS OLD PLAY
AT IDA NOYES HALL

Scenes from an old Spanish Christ-
mas play written in 1544 will be pre-
sented at the final meeting of El Cir-
culo Espanol today at 4:30 in the
north reception room of Ida Noyes
hall.

Tonight the club as a group will
attend a concert given by the Mexi-
can Pipica at Orechestra hall. Mem-
bers of this orchestra were the offi-
cial musicians of the former Presi-
dent Obergon. They will wear the
national costumes of Mexico in an en-
deavor to create a suitable atmo-
sphere for their patriotic songs.

Initiate Seven Into
Women’s Speakers

Club At Meeting

Seven women will be initiated to-
day into the Women’s Speakers club.
Evelyn Turner, last year’s president,
will officiate. Tryouts for club mem-
bership were held the week after the
open meeting at the beginning of the
quarter. Successful candidates, each
of whom gave a five minute extem-
poraneous speech, were put on pro-
bation for a month and then con-
sidered for membership.

The iniitates are Naomie Markee,
Ameda Metkals, Elizabeth Runyan,
Betty Starr, Ida Rubenstein, Sarah
Zidell, and Ester Zundahl.

Pres. Mason Talks
At Columbus Today

President Max Mason is visit-
ing at Columbia, Ohio today as the
guest of the Columbia-Chicago
club.

“Substitutes for Experience” is
the subject President Mason has
chosen for his address to the mem-
bers of the Chamber of Commerce
Forum at the noon meeting. In
the evening the Faculty club of
the state University has made
plans for a reception and a din-
ner to be given in his honor.
President Mason is planning to re-
turn to Chicago tomorrow.

FRESHMEN WOMEN

REORGANIZE CLUB

Compile Constitution; Select
New Council Members

Freshman Women’s club, originated
in 1921 by the Si^n of the Sickle, was
not systematically regulated until
this yr. when a constitution for its or-
ganization was definitely compiled
and accepted., Adelaide Ames, El-
eanor Wilkins, and Dorothy Kennedy
were chosen by the Board of Women’s
Organizations to write the constitu-
tion.

In order to include a representative
group of freshman women, a council
of twenty-four, consisting of twelve
non-club and twelve club women has
been chosen.

The women selected or the council
this year are: Elizabeth Baldridge,
Phi Beta Delta; Frances Bennett,
Sigma; Claire Davis, Chi Rho Sigma;
Olive Deuter, Achoth; Helen Eskstein,
May Friend, May Frost, Delta Sig-
ma; Elizabeth Galt, Aileen Gurk-
hardt, Deltho; Rosalind Hamm, Quad-
rangler; Jean Hanvey, Wyvern; Mary
Herzog, Phi Delta Upsilon; Winifred
Heal, Mortar Board; Frances Holmes,
Virginia Holton,, Marianna Irwin,
Margaret Newton, Esoteric; Muriel
Parker, Marcella Rivers, Betty Rouse,
Catherine Scott, Frances Tatge, Pi
Delta Phi; and Eunice Woods.

With one good quarter behind it,
the freshmen women, according to
Eleanor Wilkins plan a fast and a
rapid pace for next spring. The idea
of including both club women and
non-club women in equal groups,
makes the group truly representative
of the class. There are a greater
number of women on campus who are
not in organized groups than there
are men. No date has been set for
the first meeting of the Council in
the Winter quarter.

Stieglitz Concludes

Series of Lectures

Proessor Julius Stieglitz of the de-
partment of Chemistry will lecture
tonight at 6:45 in Fullerton hall of
the Art Institute. The subject of his
lecture will be “The Nature of Chem-
ical Processes.” This talk will con-
clude the series of public lectures con-
ducted by the University at the Art
Institute.

the University settlement came to an
end, Saturday, December 11. Ex-
penses amounted to $475, over one
hundred dollars less than last year.

Herberta Van Pelt and John Mar-
shall were captains of the teams
bringing in the most donations.
Both winning teams had totals of
over $600. The two teams coming in
second were headed by Ruth Holmes
and Burton McRoy, with $321 and
$367 respectively. Altogether the
twenty teams turned in $3,342.20,
the ten women’s teams making one
hundred dollars more than the men.

Liat Committee Chairmen

Esther Cook and Parker Hall,
general chairmen of the drive, were
assisted by the following co-chair-
men: finance, Frances Kendall and
Holmes Boynton; vaudeville, Mar-
garet Carr and Clyde Keutzer; dona-
tion, Betsy Farwell and Charles
Cowan; decorations, Isabel Bates

Catherine Fitzgerald and Jack Stam-
baugh; tag day, Virginia .Gartside
and John McDonough; program, Wil-
fred Heitman and Charles Warner;
music, Allis Graham and James

The actual proceeds from Settle-
men Night were $1,013.12. This in-
cluded gate receipts, vaudeville,
booths, the dance in the Commons,
and the sale of programs, tickets,
and flowers. Other sources were tag
day, tea dances, and balloon sales at
football games.

Organization* Aid

The booths in the cloisters of
Mandell hall were managed by Iron
Mask, Skull and Crescent, Score club,
Sign of the Sickle and the Sopho-
more class.

man, Mrs. Ernst Freund, Mrs. Edgar
Goodspeed, Mrs. J. P. Hall, Mrs.
Horace Koessler, Mrs. A. C. Mc-
Laughlin, Mrs. W. A. Nitze, Mrs. A.
W. Sherer, Mrs. Harold Swift, Mrs.
Russell Wiles, Mrs. J. G. Wilson.

WOMEN’S BOARD IS
“CLEARING HOUSE”
FOR ORGANIZATIONS

As a “clearing house” for the prob-
lems arising in the three major wom-
en’s groups, the Board of Women’s
Organizations prevents the over-lap-
ping and duplicating of activities
among them.

With the presidents and secretaries
of the Y. W. C. A., Federation, and
W. A. A., and five representative
members at large composing it, the
board has been of great service on
campus. It is definitely represented
by a member on the Undergraduate
Council.

Among the activities which the
Women’s Board of Organizations par-
ticipate in with the aid of major
groups is the orientation of first year
women during Freshman week in re-
gard to their social relationships.

A complete program of the year’s
activities, as aranged by the three
main organizations, receives verifica-
tion from the Women’s Board before
publication, thus preventing duplicat-
ing.

pioneer Tells of
Informal Life at

University In 1893

By AGNES COOK GALE, ’96

Xot many people now remain within the
University circle who “came here in the
Autumn of 1893,” as the song says, but I am
,ne of those who had the privilege of doing
that. To be a pioneer is glorious, however, and
s its own reward.

On a gray and sodden day in October, I
disembarked from the sea-going cable-cars at
Fifty-eighth street, into the mud of Cottage
,rove avenue, and looked across three empty
docks to one row of gray stone, buildings,
brightened at that moment by a sudden shaft
sunshine. There was the University! I
rtCnt across the campus to Foster hall, but
•he carpenters were still busy there and no-
wdy could get in. So for three weeks I shared
i single room in Kelly hall with another girl.

Social Life Informal

In spite of the almost laughable informality
jt life, there was no lack of social grace. I
iave been familiar with college life in many
lovely places, but never where a more charm-
ing or a more dignified tone prevailed than
at Chicago in the early days. President and
Mrs. William Rainey Harper, Mrs. Palmer,
Miss Elizabeth Wallace, Miss Marion Talbot,
Mr. and Mrs. Vincent, Mr. and Mrs. Angell,
Mr. Tarbell, Mr. Shorey, Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Pratt Judson, and Mr. and Mrs. William D.
MacClintock,—these are some of the people
who made our social life, so many of whom
are gone now.

Enjoy Activities

Although the variety of “activities” has
multiplied, we had enough. We often went
out on afternoons in Spring to watch the
practice of the baseball team, and we were
well-informed, every one of us, on the indi-
vidual prowess and capabilities of all the play-
ers. It was the same in football. Time and
again we saw our team meet older, heavier,
nore powerful, and more experienced teams
and fight to the finish with nothing to go on
but pure courage and good coaching, and we
adored them for it.

The first great Settlement Benefit was the
"Deceitful Dean,” a musical comedy from
the fertile brain of Professor George Vincent,
who had the happy faculty of sitting down
at his typewriter, and “turning on the jokes,”
as he said, and the supply never gave out.

Collegians’ Musing

Is Future Poetry

By ROSELLE F. MOSS

While the collegian engages himself in idle
musing—dashing off bits of verse at Poetry
club meetings or in economic classes—there
are fermenting the ingredients of another
Shakespeare.

This, at least, is the belief of Harriet Mon-
rue. anthologist and editor of the magazine
of verse, "Poetry.”

Poetry Clubs Aid

“Four colleges, in fact, are outstanding in
the fine work which their poetry clubs have
contributed. They are located at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, Mt. Holyoke College for
Girls, and the Universities of Waco and Dal-
las, Texas,” she continued. “Because of col-
lege poetry clubs contributions to intercol-
legiate contests and magazines are numerous
and some real poetry is unearthed.”

“Fashions”-Magic Symbol for Women
During Whirl of Christmas Gaieties

By LOIS MITCHELL

Christmas! And all the attendant gaieties
of the holiday season. To the feminine por-
tion of the population this time of the year
means smething more than the exchange of
gifts and good wishes. Clothes. Magical
word, which to the ladies is expressed in
terms of velvets, satins, and furs; and to the
husbands and fathers in terms of bills.

Formals Are Elaborate

For evening wear brocades and chiffons
smart, but the softer colors are of equal im-
portance. Greens and blues predominate, and
the trimming is elaborate. Beads of every
size and shape, sequins and pailetts and rich
embroideries are the favorites. Evening wraps
are of luxuriously soft velvet or exotically
colored brocade, lavishly trimmed with fur.

ASH’S THEATRE
SECRETS TOLD

How does Paul Ash continue to produce
a different show each week? This question in
the minds of many who are regular Paul Ash
fans has been answered by a member of his
orchestra, Al Kvale, first saxophonist and as-
sistant conductor.

“Once in two months,” said Mr. Kvale,
“Louis McDermott, production manager, and
Paul Ash get together and figure out the
shows for several weeks in advance. The ma-
terial for the single acts is often the result
of the Friday afternoon try-outs, held by
Mr. Ash, in which anyone may present a
stage skit for approval. Paul Ash is always
glad to give the amateur a chance. If they
are successful, he either books them in his
show or in some other show.”

In answer to the question as to what be-
comes of the scenery after the show is over,
it was found that first it travels with the unit
shows in a regular circuit. This circuit has
been establ'shed since the Famous Players
corporation and Balaban & Katz merged
into the Publix Theatres corporation.

Mr. Kvale is now the only remaining mem-
ber of the original orchestra. During per-
formances just sitting up straight and acting
like a dignified musician began to get monot-
onous for Mr. Kvale, so he conceived the idea
of kidding the actors on the stage. The audi-
ence laughed so much at this that it was in-
corporated as a part of the show.

Explain Origin of

Campus Traditions

By MABEL FERGUSON

Traditions! Why is it that we think so
much of them? They are decidedly*intangible,
yet their significance as unwritten laws of
the University is so prevalent that it makes
itself a dominant factor in the conduct of the
University students.

The senior class bench was given to the
Uinversity by the class of ’96 with the under-
standing that no one but seniors should sit
on it—and “woe unto those others that do!”

“C” Bench Near Cobb

Speaking of benches there is another one
around which tradition is centered. It is the
“C” bench given by the class of 1903. Some
people have the mistaken idea that women are
not to sit on this bench. Please forget it, for
the women contributed to it liberally, and the
night before Convocation those from the halls
joined by others used to serenade the build-
ings and conclude their program by gathering
at the “C” bench.

Possibly one of the most powerful tradi-
tions is that of the chimes. When Alice Free-
man Palmer gave them to the University,
Coach A. A. Stagg contributed to them that
they might be rung each night, and in 1908
it was arranged that every night, at five min-
utes after ten o’clock, the chimes should send
out over the quadrangles the Alma Mater.

Mitchell Tower Seal

Don’t step on the University seal on the
floor of Mitchell Tower, is one of the well-
known ones.

And of course we can’t forget our baby
traditions such as the Senior cane day every
Thursday and the Sophomore crimson
feathers for Tuesday dress.

Don’t think that the college man should be
conspicuous; he should differ from the crowd
in having better taste and better judgment,
but not through attracting more attention.

For less formal wear plain, little dark
dresses are marked by attractive lines and
materials rather than trimming. Calf-skin
coats are very new, and many of the shops
are showing pocket-books and shoes to
match them. Sport clothes cling to the two-
piece mdels, and the bright flannels and kas-
has are most attractive.

, Window Displays Attractive

The woman who goes to town to do her
belated Christmas shopping will find herself
hesitating before the gorgeous displays in
shop windows. She would have to be of
the calibre of the Spartan lad who allowed
a fox to gnaw at his vitals to resist, “just a
closer view of the lovely gown inside.” Once
inside she is lost, for never before have the
designers and couturiers so ingeniously pre-
sented their creations for the enticement of
the “weaker sex.”

Jazz-Phobia, Mass
Affliction—Opinion

Of M. Boguslawski

By RUTH G. DANIEL

“Jazz-phobia, the cultural disease of the
masses, is the creation of a sensually hungry
mob,” Moissaye Boguslawski, “Pianist of the
People,” declared.

Explaining mode fully the term he has coined
to apply to the so-called “obscene in music,”
Mr. Boguslawski emphatically asserted that
the feeling for jazz music was not created by
the musician, but, rather, for the most part,
by the people—by a people who have a cer-
tain hunger within them.

Popularity of Saxophone

“About seven or eight years ago,” he as-
serted, “the saxophone was made popular al-
most overnight. Always the instrument of
amusement to the musician, it was treated
more or less as a joke. And suddenly it be-
came the instrument of the people; suddenly
it began to feed the musical senses of a
nation.

“Indubitably there is something radically
wrong with the emotions of people who not
only desire such a sound, but seem to actually
hunger for distortions of our musical scale. In
our public schools we provide for mental tests
where literacy! and sanity and citizenship
qualifications of men and women can be deter-
mined. In the same way, I maintain, there
should be a test for jazz-phobia.”

Find Remedy in Chopin

The administering of the classic, Mr. Bo-
guslawski holds, is not the necessary anti-
dote for the music condition that prevails
in the the world today. He finds an effective
and capable remedy, rather, in the wealth of
easy, pleasant, and entertaining melodies of
Chopin and Brahms.

Characterized by W. J. Henderson, the
eminent New York critic, as “One of the five
of the new generation’s richly endowed pian-
ists,” and by Vladimir de Pachmann as “One
of the greatest artists in America,” Moissaye
Boguslawski—who learned much of his art
from Rudolph Ganz—is fast becoming a re-
nowned figure of modern pianistic art.

SOCIALLY SPEAKING

Skull and Crescent and Score club com-
bined this year to make one less all-Univer-
sity affair, but one more good party to add
to our list. There is no question that it was
a better dance this year. As to the bigger
part, it was almost too well attended for com-
fort.

Interfraternity Ball

Following a tradition of some years’ stand-
ing, we all gathered, the night before Thanks-
giving, at the annual Interfraternity ball. It
was at the Shoreland this year, and everyone
seemed to approve the selection of a ball
room near campus. Bobby Meeker’s orches-
tra, the principal reason for the weekly mi-
gration to the Drake, competed with the
Wolverines to furnish good music. “Competi-
tion is the life of trade” and, we might add,
orchestras. An attractive innovation was the
serving of a breakfast of waffles and sausages
in the Grill.

Settlement Night was a “Circus” this year.
The decorations carried out the idea well,
and were colorful and different. The vaude-
ville was not quite up to previous standards,
but was amusing and had several exception-
ally good acts, some new, and some very
Familiar.

Club and Fraternity Dances

Club and fraternity parties were numerous,
both formal and informal. The annual three-
way party, given jointly by Alpha Delt; Psi U
and Deke fraternities; perhaps heads the list
of formals. Although competing with the
Army and Navy ball, the success of the party
was not impaired.

Esoteric, Wyvern, Mortar Board, Phi Beta
Delta, Quadrangular, Achoth, and Phi Delta
Phi all had formal parties during November
and December. These, combined with the fra-
ternity house dances that enliven every week-
end, completed a rather hectic but altogether
enjoyable social season.

As we are considering campus social high-
lights, we must mention the Army-Navy ball
on the Friday night preceding the annual
football game. While it was not a strictly
campus affair, so many prominent men and
women undergraduates attended that it might
be classified as such. The ball started with a
dinner at the Drake hotel, with a dance in the
ballroom following.

PRINCESS PLANS .

INDIA HOSPITAL

An Indian noblewoman was only a charm-
ing girl when speaking of the beautiful work
to w’hich her life is devoted. Miss Premela
Shahne, medical student in the University,
explained in her shy, quiet way that she was
not a princess and wished to be known only
as a common person, so she could better help
the people of her native India. However, she
did acknowledge that she was of the nobility
or Brahman caste.

“There is a great need for women doctors
in India, because of the old Buddah system
w’hich has kept men and women apart in
nearly every phase of life,” she said, “and
for this reason women prefer doctors of their
own sex.” Her plan is to start a hospital her-
self there.

She is a slender, dark, little lady; very ori-
ental, in the graceful robes of her country,
and she is wonderfully loyal to India. Asked
aoout the schools there; she was quick to de-
fend them, saying that the people had warned
so long against invading nations that they had
had little time for cultural development, but
that their schools today were of the English
type and very successful. She also thinks the
Indian students are more sincere. “Here,
they’re too busy with dates to be serious,”
Miss Shahne concluded.

Recount Progress
Of Music and City

By MAURICE ROSENFELD

Forty years is represented by a couple of
generations. So, since the writer of this arti-
?le first came to Chicago, two generations
iave come and gone, and while in the mer-
:antile field Chicago has grown in the period
mentioned to be one of the leading cities of
the world, it has also grown civically, with
-espect to its public enterprises, and artisti-
:ally, as to its museums and music.

Development of Art

The last division of art—music—has devel-
)ped, and we might say has kept pace with
ill the city’s other activities, and though there
s at least one musical institution that dates
back about fifteen years before 1886 (The
Apollo Musical club, the Chicago Symphony
orchestra and the Chicago Civic Opera com-
>any have both been stablished since the last-
tiamed date.

Theodore Thomas organized our superb
orchestra, which, in many respects, is the
finest in America, and one of the finest in the
world. He took up his permanent residence
here in 1891, when the orchestra was estab-
lished, and was its constant conductor until
his death in 1904. Since then Frederick Stock
has conducted and guided the orchestra, and
has made a great name for himself, as well
as for the Chicago Symphony orchestra.

First Chicago Opera

In 1909, Oscar Hammerstein, who owned
and operated the Manhattan Grand Opera
company in New York, was persuaded to sell
out, and to refrain from giving opera in New
York city for a period of ten years. This
put Celofonte Campaini, the musical director,
out of a position, and Andreas Dippel, who
had also left the Metropolitan, thought Chi-
cago a ripe field for permanent opera. He
came here, received enthusiastic support, and
1910 saw Chicago’s first own Civic Opera
company.,

Cognomen of “Capricious Coed” Gwen

By Public Proxy to College Women

By GERTRUDE BROMBERG

(Reprinted through the courtesy of
The Chicago Daily Journal)

Coeducation has given the world a new
distraction.

The newcomer, making her precipitious de-
but in the early 80’s, has managed to keep
each succeeding decade aware of her agitating
presence.

She has been the subject of sermons. She
has been the heroine and villainess of novels.
She has been the inspiration for the girl on
the magazine cover. She is the most talked-of
ajid talked-to person today.

The coed has been given the benefit of
every doubt. She is good, bad, and indiffer-
ent. If there were another category she would
immediately be placed in it. Her versatility
is astonishing since she is everything that
has been, is, and shall be.

Still Another Role

Strange as it may seem, there are some
people who have never seen a flesh-and-blood

Campus Ancestors
Pass In Colorful

Interesting Revue

By MADGE C. CHILD

“Rich man, poor man, begger man, thief,
“Doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief.”

Campus ancestral trees are overloaded with
them all. Pedigrees are not the important
item at Chicago that they are farther east, but
it might be noted that our silence on the sub-
ject is due not to lack of “Family,” but to
lack of interest.

If it is historical characters in which you
are interested early governors, orators, ex-
plorers, and nobility abound in the dim back-
ground of your campus friends. Alice and
Russ Wiles are direct descendants of Will-
iam Bradford, first governor of Massachu-
setts. Governor Hinkley, also of Massa-
chusetts, is the great, great, great grandfa-
ther of Bobbie Cooke, who in addition can
claim William Floyd, a signer of the Declara-
tion of Independence, as her grandfather. Vir-
ginia Weiss Solenberger is the granddaughter
of Carl Schurz.

Stevensons Have Long List

John and Bill Stevenson have a most for-
midable array of ancestors. John Webster,
early governor of Connecticut; Daniel Web-
ster, the great orator, and Noah Webster, of
dictionary fame, lend prestige to one branch
of the family. On the other side, we find
George Stephenson, who invented the first
successful locomotive, and Stanley Livingston,
an African explorer. And before leaving Af-
rica it is well to mention that the uncle for
whom John Allison was named, drove the
last spike in the Cape-to-Cairo railway.

Some Titles and Royalty.

Being Americans, we are, of course, not
interested in royalty and titles, but recall the
crowds that waited in Harper quadrangle to
see Queen Marie. Perhaps they did not know
that a descendant of the royal house of Hol-
land might be seen any Saturday on Stagg
field with a large number two for a crest.
“Stan” Rouse is the man.

More titles are to be found among the an-
cestors of Peg Newton and Mundy Peale.
Peg is related to Sir William Pitt, and Mundy
is of the same line as Sir John Peel of Eng-
land. Another interesting connection of Mun-
dy’s is Robert Peel, the modern English
painter, and way back in his mother’s family
one may discover the name of Eli Whitney.

In the Metropolitan Museum there is a
section devoted to early American furniture
called the Capen wing, which is named for
Charlotte Eckhart’s mother’s family.

Ruth Mills and Lois Mitchell can tell of
some unusual forebears if they will. Ruth’s
great, great grandfather, George Folger, who
was a friend of Benjamin Franklin, made the
first authentic map of the world at the re-
quest of the King of England. Lois is par-
ticularly proud of a great grandfather who
married an Indian princess.

Modern People of Note

Leaving the past to its bronze tablets and
moss-covered epitaphs, and concentrating our
attention on more recent laurels, we find the
campus well represented in the fine arts.

Edgar Lee Masters has had a daughter and
a nephew in the University in the last year,
Madeline and Dexter Masters.

Wallace Amsbury, well known as a lec-
turer and poet, is Dot’s father. Marion Mc-
Fadden is the niece of Ernest Poole, the
author, and Abram Poole, the artist.

(Continued on page 6)

coed. Still, to talk with these folk would
evince the fact that they know an astonishing
lot about her. They would tell you the sort of
dress she usually wears, how she combs her
hair, what brand of cigarets she prefers, the
kind of men she dates with, and what she
thinks about petting and drinking.

They know the home life she has led and
who her ancestors were. In fact, they know
enough to condemn and hang the poor girl.

All Suspiciously Alike

What is still more strange is that all these
descriptions show a suspicious tendency
toward similarity. Any twenty-five people in
any twenty five states are ready to describe
the coed, and the twenty-five descriptions
are alike. The girl who, above all things,
wants to be different has been put in a stere-
oscope mold, and every time she is taken out
for public surveillance, the cast is practically
the same. It seems obvious that the twenty-
five persons are indebted to two or three
obliging sources for their information.

Art as Seen by
An Ed and Co-ed

BY EDWIN F. ROTHSCHILD

HERE AND NOW. A tragic in-
terlude in several gasps.

TIME: Now.

PLACE: Here.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE: Co-ed
and Ed.

Co-ed—I just adore art but I
■don’t see why courses are necessary
to create an appreciation of things
which should produce a rather spon-
taneous appeal. I know what I like
and that seems to be sufficient.

Ed—Art has been a result, prob-
ably in the majority of instances, of
man’s desire and inspiration to cre-
ate something that would lend pleas-
ure and incidents of charm to an
existence which is largely determined
by factors beyond his control. Where
the forces of Nature and her ele-
ments so greatly condition his ac-
tions there is a peculiar joy in cre-
ating something wherein control can
be completely exercised and where
the result has a form or pattern
which by its unity and harmony is
distinct from his experience of hap-
hazard occurrences and appearances
in the field of his consciousness. Can
we not better share his creative pow-
er by learning, the circumstances of
his production and by comparing
what he did with something by an-
other hand at a different time and
in a different milieu.

Art Appeal I* Sensuous

Co-ed—But knowledge thus gained
would be intellectual, whereas art
exerts a sensuous or esthetic appeal
distinct, to a large degree, from our
intellectual experience.

Ed—That is quite true, but our in-
stinct craves a sense of order and
by relating the various products of
art in different eras, either by his-
torical or comparative method, we
apply or superimpose the framework
of a technique of appreciation.

Co-ed—Why is it necessary to
have a technique for the examination
of objects of art when we so readily
react to them with joy and exhilara-
tion? ,

. XWfc.dk

Joys Are Varied

Ed—Joy and exhilaration may be
qualified. Football, cigars, friend-
ships may also produce them. Our
technique of art appreciation can
give them a richer significance and
distinguish them from the common-
place response that can make itself
■explicit only through such vague
terms as charming, delightful or
beautiful.

Co-ed—This may be getting us
somewhere. I do, at times, feel
rather foolish in trying to say why
I like things now that,“cute” has
become so trite.

Ed—What a man has put his art
and soul into is worthy of some con-
sideration and those components go
a long way toward making a work of
art regardless of its material expres-
sion. The man whose business is
selling gloves has a very fine and
exact method of determining the dif-
ferent qualities in gloves. Should
we not establish an efficient tech-
nique for examining the objects of
art which even upon casual acquaint-
ance are capable of producing con-
siderable delight?

Analysis Is Worth While

Co-ed—I never realized, probably
because it was so easy to get a little
kick out of the monuments of artis-
tic creation, that there was such a
rich field in the analysis which leads
beneath the skin of paint or stone.

Ed—It is a consideration worth
some concern and a course in art,
despite the stigma of academicism
which you impose, is concerned not
so much with the accumulation of
facts as it is with the inculcation of
a habit of seeing beneath the sur-
face. It is concerned primarily with
the development of a technique of
appreciation.

ON THE BOARDS

BY WILLIAM JOST, JR.

The condition of the theatre looks
bad, prospectively, for those persons
interested in the engeneous creations
of man’s dramatic endeavor.

The current return of “No, No,
Nanette” and “Abie’s Irish Rose” and
the contemplated revisitjng of “Rose
Marie” and “The Student Prince”
point a palsied, indicating finger at
the sorrowful state of decadent
drama. Either the playwrights have
taken up scenario writing, professor-
ships or editorships or else they have
run out of ideas. The second hy-
pothetical solution is the sorry state,
for editors and even professors may
be reclaimed on the urgent call of
idle resident managers and Broad-
way producers. George Kaufman
and Eugene O’Neil have contributed
in a small measure, but neither of
them have been given certificates of
immortality. Mr. Kaufman has
pushed a door bell that has been
passed by for the last twenty years
and if aspirant authors but open the
door they may find a gymnasium full
of paraphanalia fit for the best turns
and twists for good burlesque.

True, the present Kaufman ve-
hicle moves not further than good
satire, but his Beggar On Horseback
may be taken as particular good bur-
lesque. Elliot Nugent falls into line
with plays of campus background,
now so prevalent on the silver strip.
College plays make for good enter-
tainment, not so much for their ex-
act mirroring, but for their naive
acceptance of what college must be
like. But this type of dramaturgical
endeavor goes as far as a dubbed
brassie in attempting to reach the
green of what the theatre is meant
for.

If the theatre is to progress on
parallel with the amelioration of
America’s ascension to commercial
success, then new candles must be
lighted and the present tiny flicker-
infi bonfires, gasping for oxygen,
must be kindled and coaxed with the
strawberry-box-wood of tolerance.

Dennis King, Star
Of Vagabond King,
Talks of Actors

BY RUTH G. DANIEL

“American actors are not so good
as European actors, I believe; but
American actresses—ah! American
emotional actresses—are far better
than their sister European women of
the stage.” Thus spoke Dennis King,
dark-haired hero, Francois Villon by
name, of the operetta, “The Vaga-
bond King,” now playing its six-
teenth successful week at the Shu-
bert Great Northern Theatre.

“As for the American theatre in
general, it is progressing more rap-
idly than the European theatre, and
this because of commercial reasons,
I should say. However, understand
me, the European theatre is a great
deal more advanced as far as tech-
nique and the like than the theatre
of America.”

Mr. King, who was born not quite
thirty years ago in a small town in
England—the same town in which
the renowned Ellen Terry was born
—has been on the stage since he was
a lad of fourteen. His debut was
made in Shakespeare’s theatre in
Stratford-on-Avon, a playhouse de-
stroyed but some three years ago.

“ ‘The Rivals,’ ‘Schol for Scandal’
and like plays should be revived at
least once each year,” Mr. King em-
phatically contends. “Ibsen and
Galsworthy, such classic writers form
the bulwark of all good literature.”

The part of the dramatic-singing-
hero in the play taken from the well-
known opera, “If I Were King,” is
Mr. King’s second venture into the
realm of the musical show. Mr. King
is planning to return to England
shortly to take up again his classic
characterizations.

Caustic criticism, passive interest and
worse, derision, do more to smolder
and snuff than even the lack of ac-
tion on the part of eminent person-
ages who might instigate and pro-.
mulgate the efforts of undergradu- |
ate literatti

OFF THE SHELF

COLLEGIANS’ MUSING
IS FUTURE POETRY

The Shelf at Christmas time is a
most enjoyable place.

A book Christmas begins early and
lasts long, blessing “him that gives
and him that takes.” And aside
from the giving spirit of the season,
books,—those that you always did
want to read, constitute a vacation
in themselves.

“Perfect Behaviour.”

“Perfect Behaviour” is Donald O.
Stewart’s latest contribution to the
literary shelf. It is a parody satire
on current books of etiquite, and as
the author himself has indicated, “a
guide for ladies and gentlemen in
all social crises.” Mr. Stewart seems
to have caught the note of freshness
and steadiness so essential to a
humorous treatise. In places, the
humor amounts to pure wit and or-
iginality. In others, it is a subtle
and sparkling form of farcical ex-
pression.

“Banbai”

John Paris who has already sohwn
his knowledge of Japan, and under-
standing of its people in “Kimona”
and “Sayonara” has written a new
biographical story of a modern Jap-
anese whom he discovered in Pic-
cadilly. The book, “Banzai,” lacks
the usual air of mystery about a book
on the Orient, but for a good in-
sight into true realistic details of
Japanese life it is valuable.

“Chariot of Fire”

Bernard DeVoto’s new book, “The
Chariot of Fire,” has earned for him
a place among the more distinguished I
young novelists of the day. It is the 1
story of a self-styled Messiah on the I
Illinois frontier in the early nine-1
teenth century. It is powerful fic- J
tion, unusual because it involves an ]
example of the author’s interest in

AGE AND ART

BY GEORGE DOWNING

In matters of art, we are prone to
b0w to the past. Now $ may well be
that the gods of painting, Giotto,
Michelangelo, Titian, Velasquez, or
Rembrandt (to mention only a few),
deserve their pedestals: few continue
to satisfy as they do. But before
any comparison between them and
modern artists can be made a lot of
dead wochmust be mantally chopped
away. There were bad artists in
their day as there are bad artists
now. Surely, we know little of the
worst artists of the past because
quite naturally nobody thought their
work worth saving. Why, then,
should we allow our judgment of
^.d «rn art to be obscured by the bad
artists of Today? As there are now,
so there always have been and al-
ways will be, freaks and sentimental
spouters.

It will probably be years before
artists will receive or will even want
the solid grounding in technic that
the old masters had under the ap-
prentice system. Expression today
is the chief thing, and rightly. So it
was three hundred years ago. And
time must bring the realization that
full expression demands complete
command of the means of that ex-
pression : but technic only as a means
not an end.

Appeal to Visual Sense

What, however, are the tenden-
cies in the best of modern art which
make its prograss encouraging, that
link it with the work of the men
whom time has shown to be great?
In the first place, pictures are being
painted increasingly as pictures, not
as illustrations. We are past the
time, for example, of Sir Edward
Landseer, whose work was little more
than a guide to the Fauna of Eng-
land. Pictures are becoming rather
primarily designs. Look at almost
any of Rembrandt’s portraits, and
see what fine patterns in light and
dark they are; how they satisfy that
feeling which we all have for bal-
ance of masses. They appeal to the
visual sense from the start, and only
afterwards to the interests of the
mind. Now I think you will find the
same true of most of George Bellows’
works. And this insistence on de-
sign, the demand that the picture
please the eye even before it begins
to engage mental sympathies, is one
of the most encouraging tendencies
in modern art.

Modern Art Advance*

In the work of the old masters, the
design in light and dark was made
by forms which were primarily ex-

WHERE TO GO

BY ELLEN HARTMAN

Judging from the large selection
of dinner and dance places offered to
the gaiety-seeking campus people, in
comparison to those offered by the
small college town, a University lo-
cated in a large city like Chicago has
its advantages. Week-ends find
campus people represented in any
one of a dozen or more of the better
known of these places.

Among the downtown hotels,
Bobby Meeker’s orchestra at the
Drake still attracts couples from
compus, both on Friday evenings
when informal and on Saturday eve-
nings when formal dress prevails.

Edgewater Beach

Despite the long distance from
campus, the Marine dining room of
the Edgewater Beach hotel is a popu-
lar rendezvous for University stu-
dents.

Coon Sanders and his Kansas iCty
Nighthawks at the comparatively
newly re-organized Blackhawk Grill
has drawn many from campus who
are equally as interested in dancing
to his famous syncopation as in eat-
ing. The Crillon is becoming more
popular among the downtown places.

South Side Attraction*

Places in proximity to campus are
popular with those faced by the prob-
lem of transportation. The newest
of these is the Louis the Fourteenth
Room at the Shoreland hotel. Walter
Ford and his Shoreland hotel orches-
tra provide the music for the danc-
ing throngs from campus. Farther
south are Cocoanut Grove and the
Venetian Room of the Southmoor
hotel, both well-known and generally
patronized by familiar persons from
school.

istent as space-filling figures. Again,
we find this tendency in the best con-
temporary work. True, forms are
sometimes hulking in their bigness,
but artists are realizing that their
figures must occupy space, be touch-
able, enhance our own feelings that
we ourselves are not simply com-
binations of pretty, or ugly, colors.

Coupled with these advances (and
space forbids mention of more than
these few important ones) is the
feeling that modern life and mod-
ern thought are exactly as interest-
ing as thought and life ever were.
Modern art is not grounded in a
strange back-water. Surely time can-
not but show that we are getting
ahead.

Industrial Art

BY WALTER SARGENT

Onue responsibility of a depart-
ment in a University is to take ac-
count of how its subject enters into
the current of contemporary life. One
tributary to the main stream is the
influence of art upon industries. This
is shown in the tendency to add the
quality of beauty to things of use.

This tendency is universal. It
arises from the fact that no object
of use is really satisfactory unless it
adds to fitness for use, some element
of charm and distinction, some sug-
gestion of leisure. Refinement of
form and of decoration hint at a mar-
gin of time beyond the demands of
cheer necessity. Without any sug-
gestion of this sort, things of use be-
come depressing.

Fine Things Follow Crudities

Necessity sometimes compels a
pioneer generation to put up with
crudeness in their ‘environment, but
even then some few furnishings
brought from more gracious sur-
roundings are prized and copied.
Later, when the wilderness has been
subdued and material needs satisfied,
this elemental demand for fine things
makes itself felt.

A significant surface indication of
this underlying aesthetic demand is
seen in the recognition which pre-

sentations of commercial products
now give to beauty. If we examine
advertisements in any of the maga-
zines of especially wide circulation we
find that about as much of the total
space is devoted to description and
emphasis of the artistic distinction of
the products as to their usefulness.
This industrial movement is merely
the material manifestation of a pro-
foundly significant human demand
for that heightened pleasure and self-
respect that are fostered by beautiful
surroundings. The traditional ten-
dency to speak slightingly of com-
mercial art is passing away. Some
of the forms in which commercial art
appears may justly be critizized but
not its potential values. To belittle
them reveals an ignorance of the his-
tory and function of art.

No Dividing Line

In a sense there is no dividing line
between the fine and industrial arts.
Art flows into different channels. It
incarnates exceptional experiences
and this we call fine art. It also gives
grace to things of use and we call the
results industrial art. In a sense also
there is no exact boundry between
utility and beauty because beauty is a
positive huamn need. Taste mani-
fests itself not in accepting one field
of art as fine and rejecting as indus-
trial another on a basis of superficial
classification. Taste consists rather
in capacity to discern beauty in what-
ever embodiment it appears.

COGNOMEN OF

“CAPRICIOUS COED”

BY PUBLIC PROXY

(Continued from page 3)

All coeds do not wear raccoon coats
and drive in their own or in other
people’s roadsters. Some may think it
necessary to carry around cigarets in
the fashionable bags; others have only
room for their glasses, pens, and
change-purses.

No Longer a Type.

The coed has ceased to be a type.
The novelty of coeducation has worn

Selling Railway Service

The traffic department is the sales organization of
a railroad. It develops a field for, it prices and it sells
the freight and passenger transportation which the
operating department performs.

In dealing with freight service, it is the duty of the
traffic department, first, to prescribe rates both reason-
able to the shipper and compensatory to the railroad;
second, to adjust rates relatively among communities
in order that as many shippers as possible may do busi-
ness at points of competition, distance and general’
economic conditions always being considered; third, to
arrange for adequate divisions of joint rates on traffic
passing over two or more carriers.

Considerable freight i-'^fHc originates at or is des-
tined to local points, but a heavy proportion of all
freight traffic is subject to competition either of other
railroads or of other forms of transportation or is
affected by competition of other markets and of other
commodities. Railway rates are generally uniform,
and transportation is sold upon the basis of competi-
tion not only of time in transit but also of other
services, such as adjustment and quotation of rates, re-
consignment, passing reports and, in particular, prompt
attention to requests for information.

Passenger traffic is handled upon a basis very much
similar to that of freight. Passenger rates, however,
are generally fixed upon a straight mileage basis.
Special rates are ordinarily made in large cities for
the benefit of commuters, and excursion rates are oc-
casionally published to stimulate traffic at- certain
seasons of the year. In soliciting passenger traffic,
service—quality and appearance of equipment, main-
tenance of schedules, attention to the individual both
before and during the trip, courteous treatment and
good food in the dining cars—is the paramount con-
sideration, for the passenger insists upon courtesy,
comfort and speed.

A development bureau is also part of the traffic de-
partment, its purpose being to stimulate the progress
of both industry and agriculture in the territory served,
in order that the railroad may share in the resulting \
prosperity.

The traffis department is ordinarily headed by a vice-
president, and reporting to him is the traffic manager,
who is in direct charge of the sub-departments. The
major sub-departments are those of freight traffic, pas-
senger traffic and the development bureau. Where
certain commodities constitute a large proportion of
the traffic, there may be a sub-department in control—	•

as, for example, for coal and coke, for import and
export and the like. The freight and passenger depart-
ments are again subdivided into rate departments and
solicitation departments. The officers in charge of the
sub-departments are the general freight agent, the
general passenger agent, the general development
agent, the coal traffic manager, the general foreign
agent, and so on.

Constructive criticism and suggestions are invited.

away, and we can now regard the
new-comer with the sanity, and judg-
ment of experience, that is, if we care
io. There may still linger a bit of the
desire to think of the coed as the gay,
fur-clad, pleasure - loving individual
who has enticed us and enraged us for
so many years. In spite of the fact
ttha she isn't what she should be, we
hesitate to put her from our midst.
However, if we want to be fair to
her many sisters, we must realize that
the college girl is no longer an indi-
vidual or even a type. She has become
a composite personality that defies def-
hition and description. .

DIVINITY SCHOOL ENLARGES - SCOPE WITH ENDOWMENTS

University Choir
Sings Traditional

Yule Tide Carols

By MACK EVANS

The University Choir celebrates at
the Christmas season the ancient and
beautiful tradition of carol singing,
the most picturesque of its “extra-
curricular activities.” On the Sunday
afternoon before Christmas, it has
long been a custom of the choir to
set forth on a tour of the neighbor-
hood to carry in the old way the
greetings that hold for even the
most blase of us a peculiar enchant-
ment. .

But the choir is gradually adding
t0 its activities, and its traditions.
It sang as a visiting choir at St.
Luke’s Episcopal Church in Evanston
last December and was asked by the
rector, Dr. George Craig Stewart and
the organist, Herbert E. Hyder, to
make the visit annually. The mem-
bers and the conductor are proud to
have made good in a church whose
rector and whose standards of serv-
ice are natioally known.

Will Sing Again

They have been invited to sing a
program in the Winter quarter at
Emmanuel Episcopal Church in La
Grange by the Rev. Irving Goddard.
Emmanuel Church is a notable ex-
ample of Gothic architecture. Aes-
thetic considerations aside, the event
affords an opportunity for the choir
to test a building whose acoustics
resemble those of the new chapel of
the University.

Last year the three most impor-
tant radio stations in Chicago, WGN,
WMAQ, and WLS invited the choir
to broadcast. As a result of these
trials, WLS offered the organization
a contract for bi-weekly paid per-
formances for the year 1926-27, and
the choir accepted, with a thought-
ful eye on the prospective publicity.

May Go Out of Town

The choir contemplates the possi-
bility of securing occasional out-of-
town dates in the future. The dis-
tance of that future is a matter le-
termined largely by the impression
the choir makes oft the music-loving
public through the channels at its
disposal.

And the personnel responsible for
that impression is dependent for its
own existence, and for the mainte-
nance of its present standards,, upon
the freshman attitude, upon fresh-
man interest.

Find* Unfair Discouragement

The director of the choir finds that
many freshmen who might be inter-
ested, and some of their elders, have
only vague notions of the require-
ments and rewards of membership in
the organization, and are kept away
from the try-outs by the inhibitions
that customarily seize the amateur
when he is asked to raise a lonely
voice in song. They can be assured
that the initial try-out is practically
a painless process, for three reasons:
(1) The Director is the only audi-
ence; (2) he is anxious to hear the
best the voice can do, not the worst;
(3) he neither expects nor desire.'
to hear anything in the nature of a
solo; a few notes in the “middle of
the voice” are sufficient guide and
often the speaking voice is the deter-
mining factor.

Paid members rate according to
rank and amount of service rendered,
but the pleasure of the work itself
attracts an equal number of others
—that particular brand of fun that
one experiences only in effective
teamwork—that mixture of release
and discipline that sometimes travels
under the more high-hat name of en-
semble.

Praise* Choir Singing

What the University of Chicago
Choir may mean off-campus is sug-
gested in the following, one of the
WLS returns:

“I listened to your choir Novem-
ber 24th in its radio program. I
wish to tell you that the music your
choir sings is my idea of something
worth-while, especially when sung in
such a splendid manner.

‘May our countless choirs through-
out the country profit by hearing pro-
grams of such a standard.”

‘Yours truly,

Elmer C. Vedell, Director
Calumet Lutheran Choir — Calumet

District”

CHRISTMAS IN

MANY LANDS AND THE NAVY

(Srmr

By GREGORY VLASTOS

In a cozy room the ruddy glow of
the firelight is vieing with the soft,
mellow light of the candles and the
glitter and sparkle of the Christmas-
tree in casting bright hues upon the
smiling faces around the table. One
can hear the crackling of the logs in
the fireplace, the music of the forks
and knives in a vigorous attack of
youthful appetites upon the turkey
before them, and above all the sound
of merriment and happy laughter.
But outside in the soft, clear night
there is a great quiet, and one can
almost hear the stars whispering in
the silence, “Peace on earth, good
will to men.”

Bring Huge “ Pita.”

The meal is almost over now, and
the family sit back in their chairs
for a moment. The best is yet to
come. The door opens, and with great
dignity in comes the huge Christmas
cake, the famous Greek PITA, which
since time immemorial has been the
chief feature of the national celebra-
tion of the nativity of our Lord. The
happy, proud look that comes upon
the mother’s face, as she eyes quick-
ly the rest of the family and notes
the general approval, has a long story
to tell: how this PITA has been for
weeks past the main subject of her
thoughts and of her conversation
with the other housewives of the
neighborhood, with what care she
went around the market picking for
it the best materials she could find.

With great solemnity the father
cuts a piece for every member of the
family; but the first slice is always
“Christ’s”— it is sacred, and is kept
for the first beggar that comes to
the house the next day.

Sing Quaint Song*

After the meal they draw their
chairs around the fire. The father
relates some old, popular legend, and
the children sing quaint Greek
Christmas songs.

At midnight the church bells ring
out merrily, and all the family walk
under the starlit sky to the a illage
church, where they light their can-
dles and exchange greetings with
their friends, “Merry Christmas!
How is your PITA?”

Hawaii

By IRENE TAYLOR

All the world in Siam goes about
its business in the most ordinary
every day manner on Christmas. But
here and there small groups of
whites stretch themselves in the
warm sunshine and think of the
homeland with its shivery weather
and shimmery tinsels. Wherever
there is a white man there is Christ-
mas.

A year ago I and three other for-
eigners helped celebrate Christmas
in the city of Nan. The fatted calf
had been killed early and brought
to the back yard of the girls’ school.
After breakfast a dozen or more
men and women arrived with sun-
plies for the curry. Much joking ana
laughing accompanied the busy prep-
arations for the feast. The men cut
the calf into small chunks and put
it into large iron kettles to stew,
while the women added savory leaves,
herbs, and freshly pounded red pep-
pers. Some attended to the large
black steamers of rice, and others
grated cocoanuts for the sweetmeats.

Decorate Tree

Sounds of mirth drifted from the
front yard where the teachers were
decorating the tree, and hanging the
gifts, such as pencils, handkerchiefs,
soap, hair ribbons, belts, and many
other articles of wearing apparel.
Some of the Christians in town
brought their gifts, the best that
their homes could offer—choice pine-
apples, cocoanuts from a prize tree,
fresh eggs, etc.

Hold Service

At 3 o’clock all gathered around
the trees for a short service, then
the gifts were distributed with many
thrills. After this the women spread
out on the ground long rows of ba-
nana leaves which served as tables.

The word “Christmas” doesn’t call
to every student’s mind the same pic-
ture. For the benefit of readers of
The Daily Maroon, Fred Eastman,
Professor of Religious Literature and
Drama, asked those of his classes in
Religious Journalism and Advanced
Composition who came from foreign
countries to write a brief description
'■f Christmas in those lands. The sug-
gestion of one student that he write
ibout Christmas in New Jersey was
rejected, not on the ground that New
Jersey was a foreign country, but
because there was doubt as to wheth-
er Christmas is celebrated there. Here
are a fezv of the descriptions submit-
ted.

By CHARLES S. BROWN

Back in 1917, the Navy took over
the buildings of Harvard university
and made a Naval Radio school out
of them. There were about 150 in-
structors, of all sorts and ranks, and
Haynie was one of the rankest. He
was Irish, freckled, impudent, and
impulsive.

Like all the instructors, he had to
teach six hours a day, and this for
six days a week, with no time off for
good beheavior, if any. The instruc-
tors were supposed to attend drill for
two hours a day in addition to the
school work; but most of us figured
that we had enough without that,
and skipped drill.

The Trouble Start*

But one day we got a new execu-
tive officer—a Mr. Jarvis; and he
gave orders to the military police,
one fine day, to round up all the men
who were not at drill. About fifty of
us were caught, and we were put in
the brig to look at things from the
inside out. Haynie was one of the
fifty; and it was really sad in his
case. He had arranged to get a ten
day furlough, with travel time extra,
and with full pay, to go home and

spend the Christmas Holidays with
The Girl He Left Behind Him. He
had bought a new suit of clothes, on
the sleeves of which were sewed
about three times the ratings he was
entitled to wear; for he wanted to
make a good impression on T. G. H.
L. B. And now he was minus his lib-
erty, minus his furlough, minus his
pay, minus his Christmas holiday,
and minus his girl.

The first meal we got after our ar-
rest was dinner of the same day.
When we reached the mess hall, the
rear guard went up in front for
some reason or other, and Haynie
slid around the corner of the build-
ing and over to Harvard Square,
where he entered the first telephone
booth he saw. He called the office
of the executive officer—Mr. Jarvis.
A feminine voice answered—the yeo-
girl, Miss Robinson. Haynie said,
“Miss Robinson, this is Mr. Jarvis.
You will find a man by the name
of Haynie on my restricted list;
please see that he is returned to
duty.” Then he called the pay de-
partment, represented himself as the
Pay Officer, and put himself back on
the payroll.

Call* Jim’s Position

Then he called the transportation
office and got a ten-day furlough,
plus travel time, for himself, by the
same method. And finally, he ran
back to the mess hall, where the line
was still waiting for the word to
come inside and eat, and slid back
into ranks. It was half past one, and
the officers would not be on duty for
half an hour, at least.

He got away with murder. The
entire matter was handled by the
yeogirls, and he had a great time at
his girl’s home, returning to the
school thirteen days later to poke
fun at the rest of us.

More New Buildings Make
Possible Greater Activities

By A. T. HOFFERT

The thought of snow at Christmas
time in India no more exists in the
minds of the people than it does in
the minds of the children of Florida
who have never been outside that
state. Instead, the trees are green
and the flowers bloom. Fresh vege-
tables from the garden add color and
richness to the Christmas dinner. The
choice of a Christmas tree in that
land need not be confined to the
evergreen variety.

Brings Real Joy

Christmas brings real joy to thou-
sands of isolated Christian groups in
India. To the masses of Hindus and
Moslems the day has little or no
meaning. Large numbers know it
only as a Christian holiday. The An-
glo-Indians and the Europeans cele-
brate Christmas after the manner of
the West. Both the British and the
Indian press serve to interpret
Christmas to India.

You cannot spend the month of
December at a typical mission sta-
tion in India without knowing of the
approach of Christmas for weeks pre-
vious to that glad day. In order that
the boarding children may return to
their villages in time to spend
Christmas, the special program in
which they take part usually takes
place a couple of days prior to
Christmas eve. At these events Bible
scenes are acted out by the children.

Give Tooth Brushes .

The Indian tooth brush is a green
stick having the thickness of a pencil
and four to six inches in length. At
Station A, where there is a Boys’
as well as a Girls’ Boarding school,
I noticed that the boys presented to
each of the girls a handfull of these
tooth brushes for a Christmas pres-
ent.

On Christmas eve the Christians
gather for a “gayan sabha” (singing
meeting). There they sing for hours
using Indian instruments to accom-
pany the human voice. Then there
are a few hours of sleep. At three
or four in the morning a group of
the more aggressive spirits form
themselves into a singing group and
proceed from house to house, sere-
nading the Christian community.

Christmas celebration in Hawaii
takes on a unique local coloring. The
balmy, temperate tropical climate
gives one a queer and strange Christ-
mas feeling. The show windows, dec-
orated with Christmas trees, covered
with silver flakes of snow and glit-
tering icicles, causing shudders of
chills to run through the shoulders
of the passers-by, add only to the
strangeness of the feeling.

All Join

The cosmopolitan population —
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish,
Portuguese, Haole or Whites—all re-
gardless of their faiths and beliefs,
join the Christians to welcome the
Merry Christmas day. Many of them
take this occasion to express their
tender affections and kindly appreci-
ation by giving gifts to their friends
and loved ones. But the giving has
little or no religious significance to
many of them. It means no more
than a day of celebration, of merry
times, and an occasion to give pres-
ents.

On Christmas eve merry-makers
and shoppers jam the streets. If one
imagines a Fourth of July celebra-
tion, with all its noises and shrieks,
one would have an idea of the cele-
bration there. The clang-clang, the
boh, booh, the loud laughter of the
joy seekers, all sound like a circus.
Confetti of many colors flutters in
the air and some of it, settling upon
the hair of the girls, forms beauti-
ful hair-nets, and the rest covers the
streets, making walks of high color-
schemes. This gaiety continues late
into the night. .

Japan

By PAUL RAWLAND

Only one person in 300 in Japan
is a Christian, yet Christmas is being
celebrated more and more by every-
one. “Kurisumasu” they call it, and
Buddhist and Shintoist, as well as
Christian, exchange presents on that
day, and greet one another with a
warm “Meri Kurisumasu!”

Take a walk down Ginza, the
Broadway of Tokyo, on Christmas
eve, and you will imagine yourself
in the heart of christendom.

Churches Prepare

In the Christian churches prepara-
tions are going on at fever-heat for
the red-letter event of the year—the
Christmas exercises of the Sunday
school. Almost from the opening of
the fall term the children, in their
various classes, have been rehears-
ing songs, recitations, dialogues,
playlets, tableaux, and pageants.
Sunday school attendance picks up
miraculously during the two months
before Christmas—and dwindles mys-
teriously directly after; Children
desert their Buddhist Sunday schools
and come over to the Christian ones
in order to get in on the Christmas
celebrations.

In towns where there are more
than one Christian church, the cele-
brations are purposely put on differ-
ent nights, for the convenience of
those who may wish to attend them
all! In the northern city of Sapporo,
there are five Protestant churches.
They celebrate Christmas on five
successive evenings. An annual “fea-
ture” of the leading paper of the
city, “The Thimes,” is to send a re-
porter around to all five of the
Christian celebrations and to print
his critique comparing them.

Are Elaborate Affairs

Only Japanese, with their intense
love of children, their flair for pag-
eantry, and their consummate art
istry, can make of these Sunday
school celebrations the artistic and
glamorous affairs they are. The pro-
gram lasts hours. Every Sunday
school class and every member of
every class takes part at least once.
The children, in their brilliant ki-
monos, are radiant—and captivating.

Then come the refreshments. Each
one gets a paper bag. Inside are car-
amels, “sembe” (wafers), “manju”
(cakes shaped like lady-fingers, with
a bean-paste center), “ame” (like
Turkish delight, but made of rice),
and tangerines. These are merely
sampled here. To eat it all up in
public would be bad form! The bags,
and other presents which Santa
Claus has distributed, are carefully
wrapped up in “furoshiki” (silk
shopping-cloths) and carried home.
It is midnight, and the meeting is
breaking up. “Geta” (clogs) have
been ticketed al the door, and now
everyone wants his or hers at the
same time. But there is no confu-
sion, no disorder. Everyone is good-
natured, expansive, happy—suffused
with the generous glow of the
Christmas spirit.

Registration Mounts to
167; Seventy-seven
in Seminary

Activities in the Divinity school
have been increasing steadily during
the last year with the aid of the new
large special endowment funds. Reg-
istration in this school has been,
larger this year than ever before,
with the total mounting up to 167.
With the extra 77 students enrolled
in the Chicago Theological seminary
the school takes on the largest pro-
portions yet seen here.

The addition of several new build-
ings has materially increased the reg-
istration. Swift hall, the location of
the new offices, is now complete’;/
finished, and all the facilities offered
in this building are in use. Bond
chapel has been dedicated, and with
the completion of the new Theologi-
cal building at 58th street and Uni-
versity avenue the school will have
greatly increased its academic possi-
bilities.

Offer New Courses

Two new men have been added to
the faculty. Professor A. H. New-
man of Mercy University has been
offering a special courses this fall,
while Daniel Evans of the Harvard
School of Theology is also visiting
the school and offering a course. Pro-
fessors Chave and Bower have been
added to the permanent staff of the
faculty.

Professor Baker, head of the de-
partment of Missions, is to leave this
Winter quarter for a six-months’ visit
to the missions of the Far East. He
will make a study of the work of
these institutions, as well as give a
series of talks.

Increase Social Activities

Students in the Divinity school
have been increasing their social ac-
tivities with regular meetings held in
the auditorium in Swift hall. These
meetings are held for the social pur-
poses of the Divinity school students
exclusively.

A portrait of the late Ernest De-
Witt Burton has been presented to
the offices of the school by Mrs. Bur-
ton, and is now hanging in the main
office.

Religion of Fair
Play Is Creed of
Prof. Merrifield

The “religion of fair play” is what
Mr. Merrifield, assistant professor
of religion and ethics at the Uni-
versity, calls his creed.

“Unless we deal fairly with the
Chinese, the Egyptian, the Hindu

as well as the
American or Eu-
ropean, we have
not acquired an
ethics of religion
that is sufficient
for our needs of
today. The relig-
ion of fair play’
should be suita-
ble for the Ori-
ental as well *s
the Occidental.
“What we need,”
continued Mr.
Merrified, “is the
the type of fu-
ture mind that

looks all around the world and
through all history for its ideals. It
should not be bound by past tradi-
tions or sectarian learnings. Men like

Ghandi and Rabindranath Tagore of
India, and Professor Ameski of Tokio

as well as men like Bergson, Dewey,
James, ana ex-President Elliot of
Harvard are, in my mind, excellent
illustrations of this type of mind.

“If the world of religious leaders
could once get this kind of religion
it would be the greatest international
bond possible; it would probably do
more than anything else to build up
friendship among the nations.”


























OLD CORNELL IS
FAST VANISHING,
AFFIRMS STUDENT

By HAROLD WENTWORTH

Ithaca, N. Y., Dec. 16.—Cornell un-
derclassmen view with alarm the grad-
ual decline of the hallowed traditions
that have grown up in the sixty-two
years of the university's existence.
Others do not notice it much—a fat
lot they care about tralitions! The full
list of tribal customs peculiar to Cor-
nell is probably not known in detail
to anyone. In fact, so gradually do
they decline that no one knows wheth-
er many of them are still in force.

Perhaps the most persistent custom
is that requiring the freshman to wear
a gray skull cap with a red button, but
even this rs beginning to weaken. A
few years ago a non-conformist fresh-
man who reasoned that it was silly to
wear such a cap, was nearly drowned
in a lake near the campus by mem-
bers of his own class for refusing to
obey the rule. This year the startling
disclosure was made by the student
council that several hundred entering
men had not bought the necessary
headgear. No action was taken, of
course, although many sophomores ex-
pressed the naive opinion that “some-
thing ought to be done about it.” First-
year women are distinguished by a
green ribbon worn conspicuously.

Distribute “Frosh Bible”

The “ Frosh Bible,” a vade mecum
distributed by the traditionally helpful
Christian Association, is designed to
orient newcomers and explains in de-
tail the course one should take to
avoid castigation, to say nothing of a
rush of paddles to the seat. Among
the quaint folkways listed are these:
No freshman shall smoke on the camp-
us or in the football stadium. (Special
permission, however, may be granted
by application to the student council)!

Numeral pipes are
privacy.

Appearing on the
sleeves, walking on

taboo except in

campus in shirt-
the grass or any

but cinder and cement walks, depriv-
ing upperclassmen of seats in trolley

cars, all are black offenses against
code, scrupulously lived up to by
conscientious and broken daily by
worldly wise?

Abolish Contests

The vernal mud-slinging contest

the
the
the

be-

tween the underclasses was done away
with recently. Likewise the downtown
rushes, owing to the horrendous soph-
omoric practice of maltreating fresh-
men and sending them up the hill
in puris naturalibus.

In their place has come the jubilant
Cap-Burning orgy. Late in May, those
surviving the first year’s ordeals stamp
around a huge bonfire and cast (a)
caps to the flames, and (b) discretion
to the winds as they parade downtown
to batter down theatre doors and chase
policemen. The ringleaders are fined
one hundred dollars each and officials
declare such cutting up abolished—un-
til the following May.

List Customs

Other customs remain unwritten: it
is said that every woman student, be-
fore graduating, must sit in the lap
of the statue of Andrew D. White, the
first president and one of the founders
of the university: that the first co-ed
to pass by the north end of the campus
after dark must pull the switch that
lights the street light for that section.
An Alaskan totem pole, taken with
difficulty from a Tlingit Indian village
by a Cornell professor and set up near
the Armory, was for years the object
of kowtowing and cap - doffing by
freshmen. But that, alas, along with
the old familiar faces, is gone.

The All-Cornell hops, outgrown and
a financial risk, were recently abol-
ished; so, also, the Masque, an unnual
musical comedy with a cast of deep-
voiced female impersonators, the Soph-
omore Cotillion, and now Junior week,
concerning which the Alumni News
observes, "These eighty hours of jazz
present the severest test of manly en-
durance since Hannibal crossed the
Alps,” stands a good chance of going
the same way.

Former Cornellians who read this
may care to know that one of the old-
est traditions, the one that has served
to bring town and gown together since
time immemorial, is still extant; the
same trolley cars run up and down
the hills of Ithaca, far above Cayuga’s
waters.

By JOHN SNELL

Berkeley, Cal., Dec. 16.—No one
knew just how many gaping yokels

there were in the Golden State until
some embryo Ponzi from Berkeley got
hit by a truck and conceived the gi-
gantic proposition hoax, the idea to
vote $150,000,000 to education, while
still out cold.

But now that the gullible public has
fallen for this bologna and dug down
deep that the Calivarsity of Unifornia

shall have “much-needed buildings,”
the burning question arises over what
we shall really do with all this gravy
jack. “Wipe out the shacks” as ap-
plied to the Berkeley campus is about
as true as “99 44/100% Pure” when
applied to California co-eds.

JUNIOR COLLEGE
EXCLUDED FROM

C. AND A. SCHOOL

Conduct Only Senior
And Graduate
Work

Discontinuance of the administration

junior college curriculum begin-
with the Autumn quarter, 1927,
voted recently by the faculty of
Commerce and Administration

the

school. This action means that here-

after the School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration will conduct only senior
college and graduate work.

In the beginning the School offered
a four year program for students de-
siring training in business. At no time
however, did this mean that a student
spent his entire four years in technical
courses. It merely meant that the
School supervised the whole under-
graduate program, requiring that he
spend something less than one-half of

his time in economics and

New Plan Better

The four year program as
tered was entirely’ justifiable

business

adminis-
during a

period of developing teaching materials
and experimenting with a business cur-
riculum. Now that the School has de-
veloped a well rounded business cur-
riculum and has made considerable
progress in the preparation of effective
teaching materials, the surrender of
the junior college curriculum seems
very desirable. The action is also in
keeping with the present tendency in
education to differentiate more sharp-
ly between the work of the junior and
senior colleges.

ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
IS YOUNGEST GRADS’
CLUB AT UNIVERSITY

The School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration Alumni Association is
the youngest of the several associa-
tions at the University of Chicago,
having been organized in 1921. Al-
though this association is an infant, in
years, it is one of the most active of
the .Alumni groups.

The normal yearly program for the
C. & A. Association consists of three
dinner meetings, one held each quar-
ter, with well-known speakers and art-
ists. At the Autumn quarter meeting
scheduled for December 9th at the
Traffic Club Judge Victor P. Arnold,
Chief Justice of the Juvenile Court of
Chicago, and Miss Florence Brinkman,
natinally known concert pianist will
be presented.

I’he Alumni of the School of Com-
merce and Administration realize that
the popular conception of their school
among undergraduates in the other
colleges, is that C. & A. is a place
where students spend four years in
isolation, cramming their heads full of
"Polly con” and passing up the pleas-
ures of ‘‘college life.” They fornfed,
therefore, a society which they called
the "Sons and Sisters of the Silver
Simoleon.”

Each year the seniors ara “initiated”
into the Alumni association with a
ceremony which lightly acquaints
them with the problems and responsi-
bilities that confront seniors if they are
to carry out their C. & A. training
according to the “popular conception.”
I he secred slogan is “Save Simo-
■cons Steadily and See Squanderers
Suffer, and Stifle your Sensitiveness;
Set your Stride and Seek Success
Seriously." There are about 300
School of Commerce Alumni in Chi-

I he sheet not only competes with

better and emulates the city dailies by
heading each issue with a cartoon. The
news is usually feature material and
tends toward the humorous. In the

Political Economy Courses
Bring Commerce Schools

A study of the development of
schools of commerce in America dis-
closes the interesting fast that in
practically every institution the
school of commerce was in the begin-
ning an offspring of the department
of political economy.

This development characterizes the
development of the School of Com-
merce and Administration at the Uni-
versity. For many years Mr. Mar-
shall was both chairman of the de-
partment of Political Economy and
the dean of the School of Commerce
and Administration. When in 1924
Mr. Marshall resigned from the dean-
ship and Mr. Spencer became the
Dean, the School of Commerce and
Administration and the department
of Political Economy were formally
separated. Actually, however, Mr.
Marshall and Mr. Spencer were com-
pelled to work very closely together.

In view of this general situation
the Faculty of the School of Com-
merce and Administration on May 14
voted to enter into a more or less
formal co-operation with the Depart-
ment of Political Economy.

OF BUSINESS MEN

Plan to Keep Close Contact
With Undergraduates
In School

During the current Autumn Quar-
ter the graduate students of the
School of Commerce and Administra-
tion organized a graduate club. Al-
though the organization is not yet
complete, its activities are being plan-
ned under the guidance of Mr. J. C.
White, formerly an instructor in ac-
counting at the University of Virginia,
Miss Rachael Marshall, a graduate of
the University and Miss Ursula Batch-

been definitely selected.

The Journal of Business features
articles written on commercial fields.
Marketing, risk, finance, control, per-
sonnel, production and accounting are
treated by business men, students and

Three years ago leaders
packing industry approached
sity officials and proposed the

Of

the

Univer-
present

form of co-operation in the Institute
f meat packing. They cited the fact
that university men were being em-
ployed in the industry in rapidly in-
creasing numbers, and urged the uni-
versity to point the training of some
of these men for the packing industry.

The four year course ocered in the
Institute of Meat Packing is based on
a careful selection of courses in the
natural sciences and the social sciences
supplemented by a general survey of
the field of commerce and the appli-

cation of principles of
the packing industry.

may be Turned to real account.

The Institute of Meat Packing is
jointly administered by the University
and the Institute of American Meat
Packers, the net cost being paid by
the latter.

The Commerce and Administra-
tion school has added a new course
to its curriculum which will be giv-
en for the first time during the
Winter quarter. The new course
consists of a survey of principles ap-
plicable to construction and inter-
pretation of accounting records.

During the first part of the quar-
ter the class is to study the close re-
lationships between policies and or-
ganization of business and account-
ing systems and also to become fa-
miliar with the various mechanical
equipment and types of accounting
in modern use. The last half of
the quarter will be devoted to the
study of the entry of records and
reports.

Students Lose to Colleges In Law

By MILTON KAUFFMAN

Mr. W. Frend, student at Jesus
college, University of Cambridge in
1793, published a pamphlet against
the established religion of the uni-
versity. More recently, in 1924,
Miss Helen Hunt committed the in-
discretion of ringing cowbells and
parading in the halls of the dormi-
tory at forbidden hours while a stu-
dent at John B. Stetson university
in Florida. In both cases the stu-
dents were expelled and later brought
suit against the authorities. Neither
succeeded.

While the matter of expulsion and
subsequent legal reprisal by the stu-
dent is not a new thing in collegiate
annals, the English system of expul-
sion is a bit more formal than that
prevalent in.America.

Different in England

In English universities a quasi-
public tribunal, known as the vice
chancellor’s court and made up of
the vice chancellor and the major
part of the heads of the colleges with-
in the university, tries certain of-
fences which in this country would
be cognizable by more regularly
constituted courts of law. During the
eighteenth century it was necessary
that tha student be charged specifi-
cally with the offense as listed in the
charter of the university. Thus the
offense took on a semi-criminal char-
acter and the vice-chancellor in some
cases could order imprisonment.

Chapel Question Come* Up

The good old question of chapel
attendance came up in North vs. the
Board of trustees of the University
of Illinois. The University of Illinois
in 1891 required all students to at-
tend a ten minute morning chapel
service. It appeared that it was the
daily practice for one of the mem-
bers of the faculty to read a por-
tion <»f the New Testament, repeat

the Lord’s Prayer, sing religious
hymns and so forth. Foster North,
a student, refused to attend chapel
and was expelled. The court said, in
dismissing Mr. North’s suit for re-
instatement, that the rule was not
unreasonable, especially since Mr.
North could have been excused from
chapel by so requesting.

Court* Favor Faculties

That the courts are quite slow to
find the collegiate authorities unrea-
sonable is indicated in Gott vs. Berea
college, a Kentucky case. According
to the court reporter, the local color
was as follows: “Berea college, whose
students were largely immature and
inexperienced, and which itself pro-
vided board and lodging for a nomin-
al charge, could prohibit the stu-
dents from entering eating houses
and amusement places in the town
not controlled by the college, on pain
of dismissal.” The court emphasized
the basis of its decision with the
statement that “college authorities
stand loco parentis concerning the
physical and moral welfare and men-
tal training of the pupils.”

Probably one of the most curious
cases along this line is that of Gold-
stein vs. New York University. Gold-
stein, a law student typed a note ad-
dressed to a young woman in one of
his classes. The young lady prompt-
ly reported the matter to the dean
and Goldstein denied writing the
note. The faculty thereupon held an
investigation, proved that Goldstein
wrote the note, and dismissed him,—
not only for writing it, but for ly-
ing and perjury as well.

File* Action

Goldstein filed an action to re-
strain the university from excluding
him for classes. The court said, “The
letter was entirely respectful. The
most that can be said of it is that it
was unconventional, the young lady
being a stranger to the plaintiff. The

letter was as follows:

March 18, 1902

“I beg to take the liberty and
pleasure of writing this note to you.
Desiring to have the honor of your
acquaintance I have tried to accomplish
same through several of my friends
who said they did not know you per-
sonally. Therefore, thinking it would
be uncourteous to present myself
without your assent, I ask if I may do
so in the classroom, or otherwise sub-
mit to any suggestion you may make.
Hoping I am forgiven for the intru-
sion I make, I remain, etc.”

Prove Perjury Charge

The court, declaring that the uni-
versity had not proved its charges
of lying ordered that Goldstein be al-
lowed to attend classes. On a re-hear-
ing, however, the University proved
the charges and the court reversed its
decision.

Among other cases, where the courts
have upheld the college authorities, it
has been decided that the college has
the right to ordain that students wear
a prescribed uniform, to prohibit haz-
ing, and to forbid students to become
members of secret societies. In the lat-
ter connection, Mr. Justice Lawrence
of the Illinois Supreme court said,
"We perceive nothing unreasonable in
the rule itself since all persons familiar
with college life know that the tend-
ency of secret societies is to withdraw

convenience of impecunious but am-
bituous young men who had to work
elsewhere during the day and often at
night.”

Although the colleges have wide
authority in dealing with expulsions,
they are more restricted in applying
the same rules as pre-requisites for
admission. Purdue university in 1882
had a rule stating that no student
would be permitted to be connected
with any secret society while at Pur-
due. Thomas Hawley, a member of
Sigma Chi applied for admission and
was rejected. The court ordered that
Mr. Hawley be accepted as a student,
saying “The possession of this great
power (as to expulsion) over a stu-
dent after he has entered the univer-
sity does not justify the imposition
of either degrading or extraordinary
terms as a condition of admittance to
it.”

It

is

cannot

Must Have Hearing

further stated that “a college
dismiss a student except on a

students from the control of the
ulty to impair to some extent
discipline of the institution.”

Public School* Favored

The courts view the rules of

fac-
the

uni-

versities w’hich are supported in whole
or in part by public funds more criti-
cally than those of private institutions.
Thus in Baltimore university vs. Col-
ton it was held that the university
had no right to expel a student for
irregularity in attending classes. “In-
deed,” says the court, “the school
seems to have been regulated for the

hearing in accordance with a lawful
form of procedure, giving him notice
of the charge and an opportunity to
hear the testimony against him, to
question witnesses and to rebut the
evidence. The court on the basis
of this doctrine ordered the Uni-
sity of Minnesota to re-instate a stu-
dent who was expelled for insubordin-
ation, and in an Ohio case the same
order was entered where the student
was expelled for carrying a gun, ly-
ing, and acting as a general bad man.

While the student in very few cases
gets a favorable decision in an action
for re-instatement, his lot is still hard-
er where he seeks a money judgment
from the authorities. In such cases the
courts say that the student cannot re-
cover, even though the authorities
were unreasonable, if the latter acted
in good faith, and not “wantonly, wil-
fully, and maliciously.”

plan for a School of Commerce and
Industry.

The plan was approved by the Sen-
ate with the recommendation that
the school be started as soon as pos-
sible. It was not until 1898 that the
plans were finally matured and the
College of Commerce and Politics
came into being. Although during
these intervening four years it had
been voted to establish a separate
and distinct college, and there had
been much discussion as to curricu-
lum, yet when the College of Com-
merce and Politics began in 1898 it
was not a separate organization
either as to administration or curri-
culum.

Authorize Separate School

In 1902 a separate school with its
own faculty and its own administra-
tive officers was authorized. The fac-
ulty consisted of all those giving in-
struction in the college and five mem-
bers at large appointed by the Board
of Trustees. It was authorized to
make its own regulations concerning
the work, subject only to the approv-
al of the Senate and the General Ad-
ministrative Board. The first faculty
meeting was held on April 26, 1902,
and there are records of faculty
meetings until May 22, 1905.

There are no official records of
faculty meetings from this date un-
til April 8, 1914. Henry Rand Hat-
field, assistant professor of Political
Economy, now at the University of
California, was appointed dean, in
which capacity he served from 1902
until 1905. He was succeeded by
Francis Wayland Shepardson in 1906.
Leon Carroll Marshall succeeded Mr.
Shepardson as dean in 1909.

Rockefellei Gift Aids

In 1910, when Mr. Rockefeller
made his final gift of ten million dol-
lars to the University, the Univer-
sity Senate formed a committee to
consider ways in which the gift could
be used to strengthen the divisions
then existing in the University. For-
tunately for the College of Com-
merce and Administration, one way
that was chosen was to have Mr. Mar-
shall make a study of the American
Schools of Commerce, schools of
civics and bureaus of municipal re-
search.

After this study had been made
there was a reorganization of the
school in 1912, and from this time,
under the guidance of Mr. Marshall,
the College of Commerce and Ad-
ministration began a. period of rapid
development which culminated in its
becoming a professional school with
a distinct faculty and curriculum of
its own. Gradually technical courses
were added and the scope of the Col-
lege was broadened to give training
not merely for business alone, but for
commercial teaching, public service
and philanthropic service.

Change Name Again

In 1916 the name was changed
from the College of Commerce and
Administration to the School of
Commerce and Administration, as it
is known today. In 1916, another
event occurred which did much to aid
the School, the donation by Robert
Williams of the Eli B. Williams and
the Harriet B. Williams endowment
fund. This endowment yields about
eighty thousand dollars annually, and
has, of cource, placed the work of
the School upon a firm financial ba-
sis.

Because of poor health Mr. Mar-
shall resigned as Dean in 1924 and
was succeeded by William Homer
Spencer, who had been an assistant
dean in the School of Commerce and
Administration for four years.

DR. CARY GIVES
THE INSIDE DOPE

ON IMPURE FOOD

And Tells How Sources of
Poison Outbreaks Are

Run Down

By DR. WILLIAM R. CARY

(Of the Department of Hygiene and
Bacteriology •

It is unusual to find an individual
who has reached middle life without
having had one or more gastro-intes-
tinal upsets which he has ascribed to
some food.

Practically any food may be respon-
sible and it makes little difference
whether it be home prepared, home or
commercially canned—the symptoms
are very similar. In cases in which
only one or two are ill it is often im-
possible to trace the responsible food,
if a large number become sick about
the same time, the food responsible can
often be determined by a careful in-
vestigation by a trained epideincologist
backed up by a laboratory examination
of the suspected food.

Newspapers Help

The prevalence of an outbreak is
often brought to our attention by
newspaper articles. By cooperating
with the local health officer, we are
able in many cases to secure additional
information and sometimes find that he
has procured remnants of the food
thought to be responsible. We also
get the cooperation of the doctor and
are permitted to approach the ill from
whom we may secure data on the
foods eaten during the past forty-eight
hours.

Seek Sources

Correlating this information secured
from several victims, we often find
that all who were ill ate some particu-
lar food while those not eating this
food remained well. Such a fact is
of the utmost significance and leads us
to a direct investigation of the food in
question—its source, method of stor-
age and preparation before eating and
the presence of toxin or dangerous
bacteria in the remnants of the food.

ROWS AND ROWS

♦ A new organization which has pos-
sibilities of national spred has been
founded by a few men in the medi-
cal school. The typical actions of the
members can be classified by the
words queer and pseudowitty and the
blood groupings for the individuals
seem to fall in the same group, name-
ly the common donor type. These re-
markable facts seem to prove that
these brothers in bond are not gath-
ered through sheer love of comrade-
ship but have been destined by fate
or what have you to lay the corner-
stone of a fratority of a lasting char-
acter.

We, the trustees present to the
world the ROWS to be known now
and forever more until death do them
part as the Royal Order of Wet
Smacks.

| Maybe Cancers-
Are Hereditary

And Maybe Not

How great a factor in heredity in
the occurence of cancer?

This question is still the subject of
investigations conducted by the depart-
ment of Pathology at the University
in conjunction with the Otto S. A.
Sprague Memorial Institute. Miss
Maude Seye has bred mice through
many generations and studied the oc-
curence of cancer in strains bred for
forty and more generations. Mice
seem to show a great variety of can-
cerous growth, even more than was
formerly supposed.

Study With Microscope

These cancers have been studied mi-
croscopically by H. Gideon Wells and
Miss Harriet Holmes.

The mice show’ qualities inherited
from their parents among which are
the tendency to resist or to succumb
to the development of cancer. The
cancer itself is not inherited, but the
tendency to acquire cancer is heredi-
tary and it is indeed remarkable to
note the similarity between offspring
and parent of the type of cancer ac-
quired and its location.

The general conclusion to the ex-
periments thus far run is that suscep-
tibility to cancer is hereditary in the
Mendelian manner with the resistance
being the dominant characteristic.

Same Effect On Man

As human statistical evidence on
this subject is inconclusive, the results
of these experiments casts much light
on the problem. Heredity in man be-
haves in the same manner as in other
animals. Cases of human cancer fam-
ilies have been observed, which pos-
sibly may have been coincidents, but,
nevertheless, the results of the mice
experiments are interpreted to mean
that resistance and susceptibility to
cancer are hereditary, the susceptibil-
ity being the recessive character.

Miss Seye’s work is one of the few*
hopeful notes in our knowledge of
cancer.

USE INSULIN TO
TREAT DIABETES

Does Not Cure But Does
Allow Use of Sugars

By DR. F. C. KOCH

Insulin is being used at the present
time in the treatment of the disease
diabetes mellitus. The disfunction of
the pancreas makes the body helpless
as far as ability to use carbohydrates
as food. Insuln enables the body to
both use and store sugars. It appears
to convert ordinary glucose into a
special type of sugar, which type is
necessary for storage and utilization.

Whatever advances that have been
made in the purification of insulin
have not only been of material aid and
comfort to the many diabetic but have
been the stimulus and means for more
intensive academic study of carbohy-
drate metabolism.

Although insulin has been greeted
and generally accepted by the medical
profession as a valuable mode of treat-
ment of diabetes, the facts remain that
after all it neither cures the disease
or tells us why the pancreas is not
functioning as in the normal person.

Kunde and Carlson Reveal New
Results of Thyroid Gland Action

By JACK KINSEY

Research on the subject of the thry-
roid gland started years ago in the
Physiology department. The earliest
work was to determine the suscepti-
bility of man and all available labora-
tory animals to the poisonous effects
of thyroid feeding in order to deter-
mine whether any disorders in man
involve excessive secretion of the thy-
roid gland. Drs. Kunde and Carlson
find that nearly all of the symptoms
of so-called toxic goitre in man can
be reproduced in animals by excess
thyroid hormone feeding.

Another line of investigation was
undertaken by Dr. A. J. Carlson. This
subject concerned the influence of the
mother on the thyroid of the off-
spring. It was found that if the moth-
er had a thyroid enlargement during
pregancy the young were born with
goitres. If, however, the mother’s
thyroid enlargement had occurred be-

fore pregnancy and had returned to
normal during this period, the young
were not afflicted with goitre.

Need Early Start

A problem now being studied by
Dr. Knude and others is that of ex-
perimental cretinism or thyroid de-
ficiency. The results have showed that
“thyroxin” feeding could not entirely
replace a normal thyroid. However,
treatment rendered by feeding the
whole gland restored the animals to
normal, if started early enough.

CLOSE UNITY IS
ALL-IMPORTANT

AMONG SCIENCES

Cooperation In Past Cause
Of Medill Discoveries

And Improvements

By B. C. H. HARVEY
(Dean of Medical Students)

One of the most encouraging fea.
tures of the medical work of the Uni-
versity of Chicago is its close associa-
tion with all the other departments of
the University and especially with the
departments of science. This associa-
tion corresponds to and expresses the
unity of science.

The study of the human body and
its diseases is a study of biology, of
structure and function running through
a seventy year long series of processes
changing in relation to changing en-
vironment.

Need Cooperation

It is not surprising then that the
problems of medicine have been solved
in part by physicists like Helmholtz,
chemists like Pasteur, and biologists
like Harvey. It is apparent that co-
operation between medicine and these
sciences is essential.

Such cooperation has always existed
in the University of Chicago. The
group of scientific departments estab-
lished in the first years of the Uni-
versity included some that are often
called “medical’’ such as anatomy and
physiology, even though there was no
medical school. We have recently
added clinical departments of medicine
and surgery and others will follow.

THOUGHTS

My thought# are wild rampant horses
That race with flying hoofs
Upon the prairie of my mind—
Their crested manes erect,
Their tails in arrogance, flung out
behind.

Across the dusky prairie
And into a mystic land—
They run until they find you, wait-
ing,

Alone on the ivory sand.

And you pet them and feed them
with sugar

Out of your dainty hand.

Though 1 drive you far from the
desert,

They will run to you just the same —
Because you have fed them with
sweet things—

And sweet things make them tame.

—Atlas.

NOW that our athletic relations
are severed with Northwestern, some
of the boys are wondering whether
that means throwing away their tel-
ephone numbers of the Evanston
sorority girls.

WHITE STONE

(translated by William Solenberger
from the original by

Anatole France)
Into the lake's profundity
She threw a milk-white stone,
And out of its calm immensity
A little ring has grown.

Then the thrower of the stone

Turned as to depart,

Ashamed at giving the false lake

The burden of her heart.

THE WHISTLE

AND HOW

Not so very long ago the Whistle
came out with the proud editorial an-
nouncement that for the first time in
its history I was celebrating a con-

tributor’s day.

This year our
Daily Maroon
column, always a
particularly neg-
lected part of the
paper as far as an
active campus in-
terest was con-

Le© Stone

cerned, and traditionally a martyr to
the Phoenix as far as campus talent
could be conscripted ,has reached that
ideal station where the editor could
comfortably sit back and toss anaemic
contribs at the office goboon with
never a qualm of conscience. Of course
there are several names—Atlas, Peter
Pan, GeoG—that stand out as the
prominent Whistle spirits.

Atlas, writing severally as Astoni-
phronque and Bro, has really changed
since he began first to contribute to
us. Although but a year has passed
since he wrote about the little lamb
who gamboled about the meadows—
and met a fate that was rough—thus
making it sad, quite sad, and tough!,
somehow or other Atlas has matured,
grown older. His poetry, more cyni-
cal.. .sometimes even bitter, has tak-
en on finer smoothness and surencss.
He does not attempt facetiousness.
Definitely it can be remarked that his
stuff is changing from doggerel to
poetry. 1 cannot imagine the 1925 At-
las writing:

Their virgin bodies bare.
Slipping, rising, a sudden plunge.
Then smirched on the eager mud
They give themselves with a
quickened lunge—

Scarce feel the feathery thud.
Scarce feel tcober.cmfwy mmmb
Faster and eagerly fall new flakes
In passion gripped, reckless
throng—

Leaving their souls in their van-
ished wakes,

Singing a soundless song......

Peter Pan, writing, too as
the Mad Poetess, Virginia ,Cyni-
cus, burst upon the University,
mourned by the Acorns column at
Northwestern, and was welcomed
with open arms and headlines in
the Whistle. This year Peter Pan
has contributed, I emphatically de-
clare, what is probably the finest
poetry that has ever graced our
column. Writing the kind of love
poetry and poetry about love, that
most of us attempt in our lonely
hoars and 1:30 classes Peter Pan
seems to have that elusive gift of
“taking the words right out of
your mouth." Cynical, suspicious-
ly experienced, and poetically pro-
lific, she seems to be aware of all
the problems and troubles that
come up in undergraduate puppy-
love days. “Heartbreak” left many
clipped spaces in copies of the
Daily Maroon:

HEARTBREAK

Heartbreak is such a little thing,
It only means that I shall never

FIRST SNOW FLAKES

First flakes of snow slip stealthily down

Through an unknown realm of air—

Frightened to yield to the unclean town

temity brothers and club friends, is
confident that there is peace on
earth. How many presents will he
get?

Sometimes when a woman says
she hates you, she means it.

Blind dates are usually made over

the corpse of your last resolution
never to make another one.

College affairs are things that we
go to, and have!

Once upon a time there lived a

for the first time.”

Once on a time a fellow lived who
never said to a date “Somehow all

HARRY W. REPPERT
from newsboy to

Kresge Store Manager

When a boy, Mr. Reppen attended
school in Reading, Pa., where he
sold the Saturday Evening Post to
earn spending money.

Later he attended Wharton School
of Accounting and Finance, Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. Mr. Reppert
has this to say of his business career:
"I became acquainted with a Kresge
store manager and heard the story
of the Kresge plan of intensive
training on a practical scale. After
a weeks’ deliberation, I started in
training.

“Remember this: I held a good
position in a steel mill (with my own
letter heads,''desk, stenographer,
etc.) and was reputed to be the fut-
ure superintendent of the depart-
ment in which 1 was working.

“My friends and business associates
couldn’t see the future of the chain
store business. They actually
laughed at my change from a com-
fortable position to stockman in
overalls. But today .thanks to my own
judgment and the Kresge Company,
1 have reached the point where I
■ •	am managing a store of my own

w	(Dunkirk, New York), have in-

creased my earning power consider-
ably and best of au, I have a future
that is worth while ahead of me.”

For loveliness in any lovely thing.
It only means that I shall never dare
To pause at dusk in this still room
Lest I should turn and find you there
Ghost-like before me in the gloom
As, yes—it is a little thing—
Days shrouded in stark emptiness,
Nights weary with remembering..
Why, that is all that heartbreak is.

I suppose, in explaining my enthusiasm
for Peter Pan, that I might find refuge
in pseudo-scholarly references to deli-
cately etched pictures; poigantly present-
ed outpourings; wistful, haunting reflec-
tions on the bitterness of existence’’ and
all that sort of blah. But, as one of
the freshmen at the house explains, “Gee
I dunno. I just sorta like her stuff.”
I dunno, I sort of liked this bit:

MOOD

I think... .were I a man..

That I would keep a large tobacco can
Filled with my dreams.

And I would roll them, one by one,
Into white papers.

Then... .when that was done

I would smoke them.. .zvistfully
Perhaps... .or casually.

You wonder why....?

Well, cigarettes are pleaShnt things,
And that I think .would be a charming
way

For dreams to die.......

Out to the skies, songs that I used
to sing.

It only means that I shall never
care

And of course GeoG, the Whistle’s
faithful “right-hand man.” Any column
would be a sad affair and a bore to the
freshmen, without somebody turning out
iambic rhymes with the traditional fillip.
GeoG specializes on the amusing woes of
the college man and the current campus
problems. There is nothing particularly
deep about GeoG’s work: he has the

who in hell prepares our major and
minor course sequences?

THREE SCENES

1.

It was on South State street. Dirty,
ragged, reeking from fusel oiled gin,
they grouped menacingly about the
bum. Suddenly his fist shot out and
one of them fell to the sidewalk. He
backed up against a doorway, and
waited. The remaining two turned,
and stumbled off. He stepped for-
ward—kicked his floppy-soled shoe
into the face of his victim — and
shambled away.

Somehow—we envied that bum-

2.

It was at a public dance hall. With
quinine scented, pomade slicked hair,
he flicked a careless cigarette and
tapped a patent leathered foot. "Say,
sheba," he called, "C’mon over here
and get acquainted before I dance
with yuh.” The cold-eyed blonde,
(perhaps a waitress off duty) who
had haughtily ignored us all evening,
slid smilingly toward him.

Somehow—we envied that soda-
jerker. . . .

3.

It was at a theatre boxoffice. We
stood about disconsolately as the
clerk lofitly announced a sell-out on
gallery seats. Then he came up—rac-
coon-coated, tall, strong. A smiling,
high-chinned bit of patrician loveli-
ness waited, at his side. "Two seats
on the main floor," he requested, and
shoved a twenty-dollar bill across the
slab.

Sor* ehow—we could have—busted
him on the nose!!

This is the largest edition of the
Daily Maroon which has ever been
issued. We pride ourselves on an in-

articles, and even more mis-spelled

—TERRIBLE TURK

Any retail business that has grown to a volume
of more than $100,000,000 a year must be
founded upon sound business principles.

Kresge’s is a dignified business. It meets the
everyday human needs—.of folks everywhere.

The S. S. Kresge Company has developed the
art of retail store-keeping to the point where
it may well be termed a science. Merchandise
of standard grade is sold in Kresge stores—but
in such quantities that prices are consistently
lower than in stores that lack the organization
and resources of a great national institution.

There are already more than three hundred
stores in the Kresge chain—and new ones are
being added constantly. For these new stoics
we shall need managers—competent men,
thoroughly experienced — and Kresge-trained.

A limited number of young men—college men
of good character and promise—will be given
the opportunity to train for these positions.
Write at once and arrangements will be made
for you to meet one of our representatives.
He will tell you all about our organization
and the opportunities it offers college men.

Amos Alonzo Stagg this Autumn
turned author for the first time in
his career and among the various
asides in his interesting series of
reminiscences in the Saturday Eve-
ning Post he evened up with his
critics in the press stand with the
flat statement that there wasn’t any-
one in the country who could write
a football story and do a good job
of it.

This criticism, like Stagg’s foot-
ball, is rather sound stuff. One diffi-
culty is that football, a very techni-
cal sport, is seldom, if evar. reported
by anyone trained in the technique
of the game. Even the various “ex-
pert” articles written by athletics of
great fame are seldom good—for
the cogent reason that all the writing
the ex-hero does is the endorsing of
the syndicates check. Some news-
paper writer does the dirty work.

Technical writing like that a
scout does in his report would hardly,

Mere Comedies of

Errors, Says Fry

By KENNETH D. FRY
(Sport* Writer, The Chicago Post)

When the late Walter Camp under-
took to pick out the best football
players of the season some four de-
cades ago, bunching them under the
head of “All-America team” he
started something that has now
grown into an annual joke.

In the old days when football of
any consequence was confined to Yale,
Harvard, and Princeton, Camp picked
his All-America team from those
three schools. Finally a Pennsylvania
player sprang into prominence and
was accorded a position on the honor
eleven. Now it’s a free for all. We
all do it. It’s growing into an annual
habit, this choosing of mythical
teams.

• here’s an ill-conference eleven,
an all-eastern, an all-southern, an all-
aestern, an All-America, and what
not. Every sport scribe and coach
Picks an all-star team each year,
and some of them pick more than
one.

This is obviously unfair. All-star
teams are picked in three ways. First,
and best, is by personal observation,
ut that on the face of It is foolish,
for who can see all the major elevens

The football season is over. The
fact that our university did not turn
out a victorious team is being for-
gotten in the face of new interests:
basketball, Interscholastics, and. in
a month or two, blackfriars. I
wonder if they would not too have
forgotten a conquering eleven, say,
perchance, we had won. Personally
I shall never cease to regret that
during my last year at the University
om Chicago I could not have cap-
tained a victorious squad.

Football has been hashed and re-
hashed by moralists, editorial writers,
preachers, wild-haired undergradu-
ates, and what not. It has been
demned and appraised. It has been
laureled as the one bright spot in
the life of the American college
youth where he is taught the reli-
gion of sportsmanship. It has beeji
flayed alive as a time-consuming de-
mon devouring precious moments
which might better’be spent in medi-
tation and study. As to its real
value as weighed against its deffi-
ciencies, I am in a quandary as to
how the scales would tip. I can
think of individuals, myself included,
and point out definite things that it
has done which are undoubtedly
beneficial. I believe that the “Old
Man” is responsible for nearly all of
the “real value” of athletics, football
in particular, here at Chicago. It is

Coach Nels Norgren’s Maroon
basketball team opens its intercol-
legiate schedule tomorrow night when
it goes into action in its first inter-
collegiate game of the season against
the strong Michigan State quintet,
familiarly known until a short while
ago as the Michigan Aggies.

The Staters, although beaten de-
cisively by Michigan last week, have
a good all around team of the steady
type and the Maroons will be forced
to extend themselves to win. For
Dickeson, Calvin, and Drew, of the
invaders, although not stellar indi-
vidually form a smooth working com-
bination. Their defense is fair and
the fact that they held Michigan dur-
ing the first half makes them formid-
able.

Worry over next weeks’ final exams
is the most serious handicap of Coach
Norgrens Maroon-men. No attempt
has been made to force a fighting
frame of mind upon the team. As
Norgren says, “Its all in the frame
of mind that the men take into the

game, and its a question as
they will respond.”

During the past week the
of the midway team has been

to how

defense
worked

up to a fine point and the passing
which was ragged to the ’nth degree
in the Oak Park ‘Y’ game has been
thoroughly smoothed over. Alto-
gether the team is in much better
working order than they were last
week and even though the game is
really only a conditioning exercise,
the Norgrenites are set to tear
through to an impressive win.

Last year the same team trimmed
Chicago by a one point margin. The
victory was the result of a single
break in the second half.

'Cy” Benson Discloses Secrets In
Training of Stagg’s Athletics

By SIMON BENSON
(Varsity Athletic Trainer)

The athletic training quarter func-
tions chiefly in a three-fold capacity:
First, preventative; second, first aid;
and third, restorative.

In general, when considering all
of the athletic competitors, the pre-
ventativt phase is unquestionably the
most important of the three. In full
accord with the theory that “An
ounce of prevention is better than
a pound of cure,” th j athletic depart-
ment supplies the competing athlttes
with the best protective equipment
possible. This is esecially true in
football. The uniforms are rein-
forced and padded so as to give the
wearer the greatest possible protec-
tion—yet, cumbersomeness and ex-
cessive weight must be avoided in
order to not hinder or retard a play-
er’s movements.

Personal Defect* Treated

Quite aside from the general equip-
ment, however, come the special ap-
pliances necessary to give support
to any particular weakness of the in-
dividual player. Such individual phy-
sical defects generally originate from
from two distinctly different sources:
Either they are inherent in the in-

dividual,—in which case they should
have been remedied earlier in life
by proper Corrective Gymnastics, or,
as is most frequently the case, they
are resultants of previous injuries.

In order that such personal weak-
nesses be detected and properly diag-
nosed, every player is submitted to
a thorough physical examination by
the team physician. The results of
these examinations are carefully re-
corded and filed for future refer-
ences; and wherever the diagnosis re-
veals any noteworthy defects, cura-
tive treatments are at once prescrib-
ed to permanently eliminate the
trouble, if possible—while at the
same time, in order to prevent furth-
er injury, temporary protective
measures such as braces and band-
ages are applied during every prac-
tice in which the player engages.

Three Important Feature*

The first aid feature is, in a sense
of importance, next to that of pre-
vention. It’s a case of “The harm
has been done, make the most of it.”
Almost any injury which can immedi-
ately be subjected to proper remedial

MIDWAY FOOTBALL
OUTLOOK FOR 1927

IS

By
(Former

MUCH BRIGHTER

C. V. WISNER, Jr.

Daily Maroon New* Editor

and Campus Correspondent of
The Chicago Tribune)

That football, after hitting the
depths at the Midway this fall, is
once again on the upward climb,
seems fairly well assured at this
writing, in spite of the bellowings
of malcontent alumni who can do no
better than predict a similarly dis-
astrous campaign next fall, to cap
the tragedy of the one just past.

Seasons, such as the Maroons just
passed through, come regularly to
every team, though perhaps not so
severely. Iowa, like Chicago, is suf-
fering from the same sickness—mo-
notonous defeat. Illinois felt it in
1921 and 1922, Ohio had its troubles
last year, but adroitly came to the
front again this fall, Michigan struck
the valley in 1919 and 1924, while
from 1917 to 1923, the most loyal
Purple supporter would have hesi-
tated in saying that Northwestern
had a good year. 'Yet these teams
have survived the sickness, and, per-
haps, been the better for it, and Chi-
cago seems destined to do the same.

The best barometer of a Maroon
team’s capacity, is the schedule Coach
Stagg selects for them. In 1920, Chi-
cago had a powerful defensive team
which was totally lacking in attack,
and the year was far from the best,
yet at that time Stagg booked Prince-
ton for 1921, and beat them on their
(Continued on Page 5)

squads. He is a member of Phi
Kappa Psi, Skull and Crescent, and
Iron Mask.

This is the eighth annual series of
these city and suburban meets. They
are usually held in connection with
varsity indoor meets with Big Ten
opponents.

Weddell Asks for
Student Support
At Cage Battles

By WILLIAM WEDDELL
(Head Cheer Leader)

With the brief intermission be-
tween the football season and the
basketball season now over, we must
again muster that spirit which has

marked
beyond
similar
support
become

Chicago students above and
the undergraduates from
institutions. The unfailing
of the Maroon cheerers has
a matter for mid-western

comment and praise. It has definite-
ly proved thatxthe University of Chi-
cago students and alumni have not
only a great loyalty, but, in addition,
something that is even deeper and
truer than mere student spirit. It is
this support that we must give to
our basketball team this winter and
to the other sports throughout the
new year.

Our basketball team appears to be
a strong outfit. There can be no
doubt about it being a fighting team.
If the student can carry that same
fighting spirit to the gymnasium this
winter that they displayed in the
stands this fall, the success of the
season will be assured.

The team is fit and ready, the Uni-
versity band will be on hand with
the inspiring Chicago songs. There
only remains that important ques-
tion of the student backing to be
decided. Let us come back from the

MORE LOCKER ROOM

Down deep in the basement of
Bartlett Gym things are not like
they used to be. The University Ex-
pansion Program has invaded the
walls of the varsity training quar-
ters and over a thousand dollars
has been spent to give the athletes
more room. New showers, new lock-
ers, and more space are the main im-
provements now being made.

FENCING GAINS FIRM
PLACE IN WORLD’S
ATHLETIC CALENDAR

Here it pictured one
of t h e experiences
which the Midway
Baseball Players en-
joyed on their trip to
the far east.

By COACH R. V. MERRILL

Interest and activity1 in fencing
has been on the increase during the
year now ending, both abroad and
in this country. The numerous events
both national and international,'
which marked the European season
were heavily attended by competitors
and spectators and there was much
brilliant competition. Lucien Gau-
din ,the most famous of French
swordsmen, has been challenged for
his title of world’s champion by the
Italian professional Aldo Nadi, the
Italian champioq of this year in foil,
duelling sword and sabre. The pro-
posed match will be specially inter-
esting (if it comes off), because of
the opposition of first-class represen-
tatives of the Italian and of the
French schools of fencing.

Coach and Player Give Personal
Versions of Japan Baseball Trip

By NELS NORGREN

In August 1925, the University of
Chicago baseball team started on its
fourth quinquennial tour to Japan as
guests of Waseda University of Tok-
yo, Japan. The itinerary included
four stops in the Northwest enroute
to Seattle, nine days at Honolulu,
Hawaii, about a month and one half
in Japan and ten days at Seoul in
Korea, or Keijo, chosen as it is now
known under Japanese administra-
tion, with periods totaling about thir-
ty-five days of ocean travel. This
tour has prompted The Daily Maroon
to request an article for the annual
Christmas edition on the educational
value of the trip to the members of
the team.

It seems to me that the important
educational feature was the actual
contact the boys had with the various
phases of life that they met, which
created a first hand interest in these
new things for them, and even though
there are plenty of books written
about the places we visited, the boys
probably would never have develop-
ed an interest in the Orient had they
not had their interest awakened by
first hand contact. Several of the
boys have told me that since return-
ing from the Orient they have read
every book, newspaper and magazine
article concerning the Far East that
has come to hand.

By JAMES R. WEBSTER

When twelve University of Chi-
cago students started for the Orient
in charge of their coach I venture to
say that the predominating thought
was that they were to see the world,
enjoy themselves, and incidentally
play a little baseball. There is no
question in their minds now as to
whether they enjoyed themselves or
not. As to how they played baseball
I will not, as one of the party, ven-
ture to say. This article is written
for the purpose of showing that they
saw the world in a manner which
will cause the memory of the trip to
stay with them as long as there is
anyone to listen to them hold forth
on the subject.

Memorable experiences began very
soon after leaving Chicago. While
spending a day in Glacier National
Park the team was introduced col-
lectively and individually to Mr. II-
vin S. Cobb. And after meeting him
one realizes why his literary endeav-

ors are so popular. His conversation
shows that the author and the man
are the same. Writing, talking or
thinking his ideas and ways of ex-
pressing them are always consistent.

In the great Pacific Northwest
were many new sights. Anyone who
has ever been in a gigantic lumber
mill seen logs four to five feet in
diameter and fifty feet long tossed
around as we would handle a bat
can but marvel at the way science
and machinery serve the race.

Off For Honolulu

As the President Pierce steamed
through the Golden Gate westward
bound it was felt that the trip was
really begun. It took six days to
make the trip to the Hawaiian. Is-
lands, and after remaining in this
earthly paradise for a week the team
lined up to watch the board depict-
ing the non-stop flight from San
Francisco to Honolulu. Having come
over that distince in six days we could
but marvel at the speed the aviators
were making. Then came the word
that they had been forced down and
were lost. We left Honolulu before
any word had been received from
them and fully believing that all was
(Continued on page 7)

In America it is the latter school
which has become established and
there are few fencers who are versed
, in the other. Gaudin, by th way,
jn consequence of a dispute with last
year’s champion of France in duell-
.ing sword, Armand Massard, met
him in duel and was lightly but de-
cisively wounded ,a number of othtr
duels, with no more than slight
wounds as results, are recorded in
the official bulletin of the Interna-
tional Fencing Federation. The eld-
er brother of Aldo Nadi has in the
last few weeks won the Italian cham-
pionship tournaments in all three
weapons, and must now meet Aldo to
determine the final title; there is
enough rivalry between the two to
make the matches vry keen.

In this country the number of
fencing clubs established grows as
an understanding of the sport reaches
more and more of the public. The in-
tercollegiate competition in the past
few years has been becoming much
more serious than at any time be-
fore, with improvement in the num-
ber of institutions partaking and in
the proficiency of individual fencers.
Seven universities in the Conference
now’ have teams, as have a number

In 1892 football like the Univer-
sity of Chicago wras hardly more than
a name. The gymnasium was a small
structure which harbored men, wom-

these conditions that A. A. Stagg had
to labor in starting a football team
in the first year of the University.

The “Old Man” reminiscing on the
evolution of the gridiron sport at
the University said, “We had no
grounds so we practiced on the old
lot where the New Medical buildings
now stand. We also played over in
Washington Park a good deal. Then,
as now, every undergraduate had to
take gym so I took the whole bunch
over on the corner lot and gave them
all football formations to learn. With

SWIMMING ASSUMES
MAJOR PROPORTIONS

AS INTEREST GROWS

By COACH McGILLIVRAY

Most universities and colleges rec-
ognize swimming as a major sport
and award the major letter, but does
this make it a major sport? What
constitutes a major sport?

Reference to major sports brings
to mind the sports in which the ma-
jority show an interest. This interest
is brought about tither by actual par-
ticipation in the sport or the public-
ity given it; and publicity is given
the sport that can accommodate the
largest number of spectators.

Swimming has been handicapped by
lack of room for spectators and suit-
able natatoriums. Great publicity
has been given some championship
swimming meets but when it was
found that only a few seats were
available, the interest was soon lost.
This handicap is fast being removed.
In the past few years not only larg-
er and better equipped natatoriums
have, been built but much space was
set aside for spectators. The number
of swimming pools has almost tripled
in tht last five years. The University
of Iowa has a new swimming pool

Although our mission was osten-

with some of the actual phases of
geography and geology which most

There were the vast wheat fields of
the Dakotas, the cattle ranges of

The men selected for this all-star
team are chosen because of outstand-
ing performance throughout the sea-
son. An effort was made to choose
the players for their own capabilities
and not because they happened to look
well on a winning team. It will be
noticed that most pf the players were
members of teams that reached the
semi-finals. There are two reasons for
this; first, the men were seen in ac-
tion oftener and with better support;
second, in most cases these men were
largely responsible for their team’s
position.

Liat Qualifications

Gordon was probably the best all-
round player of the season. His
speedy, deceptive running, accurate
passing, and remarkable kicking make
him the logical leader of the team.

Cody is placed in the backfield with
Gordon because of his marvelous run-
”ing and short-passing ability. His
defensive strength would be a great
help to any group.

Libby and Preiss are given the ends
because of their speed and shiftiness,
together with their reliability in the
reception of passes.

' lark, Gist, and Kelly are placed in
the center positions. The former two
are exceptionally good at hurrying the
Passer and preventing runs, and Kelly
"ould be a valuable asset in a short-
Pass defense.

Ahose all-round ability justifies their

Growth of I-M
Athletics In Big

Ten Remarkable

By DR. C. O. MOLANDER
Intramural Adviser

Intramural Athletics have grown in
rather a haphazard manner. But to-
day there is rather a definite trend in
this field. In the Western Conference
it had its first beginning at Ohio State
University in 1912, and at the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1913. In both
places it was just a branch of the Ath-
letic Association.

In the year 1919 a new era in intra-
mural athletics had developed. The
great World war had just closed and,
as a result, there was a tremendous
impetus given to athletics, especially
in the colleges and universities thru-
out the country. The Western Con-
ference athletic heads were quick to
recognize its significance and took ad-
vantage of the situation. Up to this
time there had been little effective or-
ganization along intramural lines.
Ohio State university and the Univer-
sity of Michigan, with their increased
enrollent and as as result of the cumu-
lative experience since 1912, reorgan-
ized and created departments of intra-
mural athletics.

The other Big Ten schools were
quick to follow the lead of these two
universities, until at the present time
every Western Conference university
has its own department of intramural
athletics, and officially recognized as
such. Each are headed by well-trained
men and they are giving all or the
greater part of their time to this gi-
gantic task. Taking Michigan as an
example, we find that they have a full-
time intramural director, an assistant
director, a field supervisor, an intra-
mural trainer, and office stenogra-
phers, all of whom are paid, and in ad-
dition they have a well organized man-
agerial system under their control. The
need for such supervision is immedi-
ately seen when we note the growth
of intramural athletics in Michigan,
in 1912 there were 2058 engaged in 13
intramural sports, and in 1925, 10,336
competed in 24 sports.

As a result of this remarkable
growth, Ohio State university called
the first conference of intramural ath-

GOLF TOURNAMENT

Fall golf for 1926 had the largest
number of entries and a greater num-
ber of men who actually played than
in other years. There were twice as
many entries as last year, but Gue to
poor conditions of the course, the low
score of 75 was one point higher than
last year.

Interest was high and many matches
were pending on the final green score.

WINTER PROGRAM

Telegraphic Bowling Meet
Expected To Rouse

Interest

By GORDON WALLACE
Winter Sports Manager

The coming of Winter quarter in-
tramural athletics is hailed with en-
thusiasm by I-M fans. The variety of
sports available is much larger than
during either of the outdoor seasons,
and many more participants are to be
benefited.

Basketball is the most important of
winter sports. There are very few who
have never played basketball. This ac-
counts in part for the popularity of
the game in I-M circles. It is rumored
that nearly a hundred teams will play
this winter. These teams will be di-
vided into leagues of six members
each, of which there will be five fra-
ternity, two non-Greek, and two grad-
uate groups. It is advisable that the
teams begin practice as soon as pos-
sible. Before the official season opens,
the Bartlett courts are to be reserved
from 7 until 10 o’clock every evening
for teams wishing to practice.

Bowling Popular

Bowling is the most popular minor
sport of the Winter quarter. Matches
will be held on the Reynolds student
clubhouse alleys. It is expected that
every organization will enter a team
in this tournament. The fact that the
scores are automatically entered on
the Western Conference Telegraphic
Meet board creates an added incen-
tive. The Ohio State I-M department
annually awards a cup to the winner
of this tournament. Handball ranks
second in interest among the minor
sports. Matches in this are played in
the courts under the west stand.
Fowl-shooting, wrestling, boxing, and
fencing will complete the program of
minor sports for the Winter quarter.

As a grand finale to the winter
sports the Intramural department of-
fers the Winter Athletic Carnival.
Here the finals will be held in basket-
ball, track, wrestling, boxing, and fenc-
ing. At the conclusion of the various
events, all prizes and awards for the
Winter quarter will be presented to
the winners.

Only Twenty of 115

Games Unplayed

A successful touchball season was
terminated with the victory of Psi Up-
silon over Phi Sigma Delta for the
championship. One hundred and fifteen
games were scheduled and of these
all but twenty were played. Thirty fra-
ternity teams, five club teams, and five
graduate groups entered. This is the
first year that a graduate league has
been successful.

Reconstruction of
I-M Department

Showing Results

By JOHN HOWE
General I-M Manager

Intramural competition is at the
peak of an astonishing boom. Three
years ago the athletic department took
over the loosely organized Interfrat-
ernity sports schedule, revised 'its
purpose from one of strictly fraternity
competition to one of “sports for every
male student” and molded the new In-
tramural Department into a highly ei-
ficient, business-like organization. Un-
dergraduates retained the management
of the new Division of the Athletic
Department, but Doctor C. O. Mo-
lander was appointed Intramural Ad-
viser.

The new Department soon found
that it had tapped a rich vein of inter-
est. A genuine love of athletics, plus
fraternity and Intramural-club compe-
tition, plus a little timely pushing on
the part of Intramural officials brought
surprising results. The records show
that last year some five thousand men,
counting duplications, competed in six-
teen sports. Over thirteen hundred
dollars was expended on trophies and
awards.

Reach Saturation Point

Competition between fraternities has
constituted up to the present, the bulk
of the business. The saturation point
has at last been reached. The chief
constructive work of the Intramural
Department from now on will be the
development of interest among the two
thousand unorganized men in school.
Not an easy talk. Non-fraternity
men are just as keen about sports as
fraternity men, but they do not have
the group interest to drive them on.
The solution, of course, is to give them
that group interest. Again, not an
easy task. And not an impossible one.
The Intramural Department is now at-
tempting to organize these men into
continuing social groups, according to
some common interest or common
background other than their interest
in sports. If the Intramural Depart-
ment can do this it will have accomp-
lished a thing immeasurably more im-
portant, even, than the building of
good bodies in University men.

INTEREST WAS KEEN
IN HORSESHOE TILTS

By WALTER H. HEBERT,
Horseshoe Manager

The Horseshoe Tournament of 1926
was the largest ever conducted by the
Intramural department. A greater
number of teams participated and a
high degree of interest was shown
throughout.

The tournament opened on October
13 and closed Dec. 3. Fifteen courts
were used, five matches being played
at a time. Fifteen games were played
each afternoon, 104 games played in

DELTA SIGS, TAUDELTS FOLLOW

CLOSELY IN WAKE OF INDEPENDENT
ORGANIZATION AS FALL SEASON ENDS

Hollinger, J. Budlong In
Lead of Individual
Scorers

Tabulations of the individual point
awards for the Fall quarter show that
Hollinger and J. Budlong, both of
Delta Upsilon, are leading the race for
honors which the I-M department is
conducting for the entire year.

Hollinger, who starred on the touch-
ball field and in the swimming tank,
was a consistent performer in all lines
of Intramural athletics, and accumu-
lated 145 points during the quarter.
Budlong, also a consistent player, gar-
nered 140 points, while Wiles, Phi
Gamma Delta, and Goodman, Midway
Athletic club, scored 135 tallies each
to come next on the list. ,

Following is a list of all men who
have a score of 100 points or better
for the quarter: T. Budlong, Schne-
berger, Tobey, and Clark, of Delta
Upsilon; Norberg and Porter, of
Lambda Chi Alpha: Schaeffer, of Phi
Gamma Delta; Hansen of Phi Kappa
Sigma; H. Hoffman, C. Hoffman, A.
Hoffman, and Sheer, of the Macs;
Beiles, Caplow, Edelstien, Fingold,
Fried, and Priess, of Phi Sigma Delta;
Crane, Gordon, Libby, Lott, Pollard,
Sheldon, and Watrous of Psi Upsilon;
and Davis, Gidwitz and Solomon of
Tau Delta Phi.

Many others were close behind with
point totals in the 80’s and 90’s. They
all have a good chance to raise their
standing to the head of the list in the
next two quarters of competition.

Harriers Galloped
On Snow and Ice

Pinner, of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, won
the cross-country race, Nov. 10, by
beating J. Holt, Alpha Delta Phi, in the
last five yards. Those finishing in third
to tenth places were: Ziegler, unat-
tached; Farwell, Phi Psi; Steere,
Lambda Chi; Pinckovitch, Phi Beta
Delta; Gidwitz, Tau Delta Phi; G.
Faris, Delta Sigma Phi; Trowbridge,
Phi Psi, and Hickman, Romans.

The team prize was won by Phi
Kappa Psi—Farwell, Trowbridge, and
Yaeger. Delta Sigma Phi, with Faris,
Belt, and Springer took second place,
while Sigma Chi, with Stromer, Glynn,
and Bassett finished third. Team
points, on the basis of one point for
first place, two for second place, etc.,
were:

Phi Kappa Psi ................. 39

Delta Sigma Phi ............... 44

Sigma Chi ..................... 56

Tau Delta Phi ................. 64

Delta Upsilon ................. 70

Chi Psi ......................   116

Phi Kappa Sigma ............... 155

Sigma Nu ...................... 164

Kappa Sigma, Macs, Chi
Psi Deadlocked for
Fourth Place

The following ten organizations col-
lected most of the points awarded by
the Intramural department during the
Fall quarter:

Burton Club ................ 180

Delta Sigma Phi ........... 177*4

Tau Delta Phi .............. 173^

Chi Psi .................... 170

Kappa Sigma ................ 170

Macs ....................... 170

Delta Upsilon .............. 168

Phi Kappa Sigma ............ 165

Phi Gamma Delta ............ 135

Phi Kappa Psi .............. 135

In the order of the finish the other
organizations are: Sigma Chi, Sigma
Nu, Alpha Tau Omega, Pi Lambda
Phi, Kappa Nu, Phi Sigma Delta,
Psi Upsilon, Lambda Chi Alpha, Delta
Chi, Campus Terrors, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, Phi Delta Theta, Cardinals,
Phi Pi Phi, Alph Delta Phi, Delta Tau
Delta. Tau Kappa Epsilon, Beta Theta
Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Tau Sigma
Omicron, Zeta Beta Tau, Romans, Phi
Beta Delta, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Acacia,
and Alpha Sigma Phi.

Well Represented

The Burton club, an independent
organization, compiled their points
through entrance in touchball, horse-
shoes, cross-country, golf, swimming,
and by garnering fifty markers through
winning the Aquatic title.

Delta Sigma Phi gained their points
by entrances in touchball, horseshoes,
cross-country, golf, swimming, and by
being league winners in horseshoes,
runners-up in cross-country, and tak-
ing fourth place in swimming.

Tau Delta Phi finished in third place
by virtue of entrances in touchball,
horseshoes, cross-country, swimming,
golf, and by being league runners-up
in touchball, league winners and third
place University champions in horse-
shoes, and fourth-place winners in
cross-country.

7 Touchball Teams
Were In Finals

The University touchball champi-
ons were decided from the following
league winners:

Delta Kappa Epsilon.

Kappa Sigma

Sigma Nu

Phi Sigma Delta

Psi Upsilon

Cardinals

Chicago Theological Seminary.

Cups are given to the league win-
ners. A large silver football goes to
the Psi U.’s.

pitched every championship game.
Stagg also performed marvelously at
end on the footbail team. He was
made end on Walter Camp’s first
All-American football team of 1889.

(Continued from Page 1)
ently the most popular way, is by
guess work.

If I should pick an All-America
team, which I certainly am not quali-
fied to do, I should have to do it by
what I have gleaned from reading ac-
counts of various games thruout the
season and by conversation with
players, coaches, and officials.

If I put Benny Friedman, the grtat
Michigan general, on an All-Amer-
ica team, then some fan who saw
Michigan play the Navy would come
forth with the comment that I was
out of my head. Likewise anyone
who saw the Wolverines play Ohio
State would be thoroughly in favor
of my choice.

Consistency for the season should
be the first requisite for choosing a
player for an all-star eleven. Two
years ago Austin McCarty played a
scintillating game against Illinois.
Never before had he risen to such
heights, and incidentally he never did
again. Anyone who saw that game
alone that season would have picked
McCarthy for an all-star team and
yet logically he could not have been
placed on such an eleven, merely on
the basis of that one performance.

It is unfair to say that one player
is better than another. Who am 1
to say that Baker of Northwestern is
a better player than Wilcox of Pur-
due? If Wilcox had played behind a
line as strong as that of the Purple
he might have been rated the best
halfback in the country. The same
applies to Nick Kutsch, Iowa’s cow-
boy halfback. A star is handicapped
by playing with a comparatively
weak eleven, and it is therefore un-
fair to him to pick some other player
ahead of him.

Just an example of the foolishness
of trying to choose an All-American
team. An eastern scribe, of whose
writing I am quite fond, picked a
team. In his honorable mention col-
umn he named Gustafson of Minne-
sota, instead of Northwestern, and
for Purdue he named Wilcox and
Phelan. The gentleman may or may
not know that coaches no longer
play in the Big Ten, but nevertheless
Jimmy Phelan found his way into
the list of star players.

With very few exceptions all-star
teams are somewhat comical but I,
along with the rest of the boys, will
keep on choosing them since the side-
line experts, who buy the papers,
keep insisting that they appear.

(Continued from Page 1)
fessional, is foreign to those actively
interested in the development of foot-
ball teams and the players who are
members of the various elevens.
Sportsmanship of the highest type
prevails and better citizenry results.

While the* world war had a lot to
do with placing football among the
foremost of American sports, drastic
changes in the rules had a lot to do
with the kindled interest. Following
the season of 1905 when Chicago de-
feated Michigan in a memorable
struggle, 2 to 0, the rules were dras-
tically changed.

In 1906 came the forward pass
and the ten yard rule. Pushing and
pulling of the player with the bail
was eliminated and with it went the
bone crushing mass plays, the flying
wedge and turtle back formations.
The new rules opened up the game,
threw the players more on their own
resources and above all the ball is
in sight of the spectators most of the
time.

Each year, the coaches are perfect-
ing the attacks and the same sort of
cunning used in planning a strong
defense to meet these offensives.
Under such conditions the game will
continue to improve and if legis-
lated in the proper manner, the
mammouth stadiums which have been
built at some of our institutions may
not hold the crowds in years to
come.

(Continued from Page 1)
he that actually tunes into one the
song of sportsmanship and the tingle
of red-blood.

There is no glory that quite equals
the glory of the gridiron when the
band plays the victory song after the
game instead of the alma mater.
Their is no chagrin quite so acid as
the chagrin of defeat when the band
plays the alma mater after the game
instead of the victory song. Yet it
is all in the game. And in spite of
the fact that there are well-enough-
meast slaps on the back and kind
words saying “thats alright old man;
you played the game—that’s all we
ask,” their is a feeling, an unthwart-
able, volatile feeling that just “is.”
Perhaps it is that “feeling” that gives
football all the real, intrinsically
metaphysical value that it has. Per-
haps it is that “feeling” that first
teaches a man that age-old lesson
“keep on top and you’ll always stay

on top”—“be a loser and you’ll shake
down.” It isn’t because of the aene
mia of human nature; it isn’t because
people aren’t “big, kind folks,” if8
simply because it’s “the way of all
flesh.” In business, in football, in de-
bate or on the pulpit it’s the winner
that is the success. It isn’t the in-
significant sacrifices, the self-pity and
the martyrdom-complex—its getting
your teeth in the sod and eating
through. The football grub is tough
meaty stuff that’s hard to masticate-
the business grub is hot, steaming
belly-warming stuff; the debate grub
is stimulating stuff like chili-sauce or
ginger-ale; the pulpit grub is fragile,
meticulous asparagus or celery. So
it’s all a matter of taste. God help
the fellow that picks the tough meat
if he has a tongue for chili-sauce
and ginger ale.

And I wish the 1927 team a world
of success. May they all be meat-
eaters.

OUTLOOK FOR 1927
IS MUCH BRIGHTER

W. V. MORGENSTERN
GIVES COLD DOPE
ON SPORT WRITING

(Continued from page 1)
own grounds, with only a few addi-
tions to his beaten team of the year
before. For the coming campaign,
Stagg has chosen one of the stiffest
schedules that a Maroon team has
ever faced, and in this writer’s opin-
ion, he is not doing so without rea-
son: in booking Oklahoma, Indiana,
Purdue, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michi-
gan, Illinois, and Wisconsin, Stagg
is planning to put a team in the field
next year that will be able to cope
effectively with such opposition. Not
that the Maroons can expect to sail
through such a sea of terrors unde-
feated, but they can expect to acquit
themselves much better than they
did against their far-easier opposition
this fall.

But once in the past decade has
Stagg gone out of his way to arrange
games with teams for whom he was
unprepared on the gridiron. In 1925,
after a championship year, with only
a few veterans missing, and with a
host of good new material to add to
his squad, Stagg topped off the year
with Dartmouth and Pennsylvania. In
doing so, his judgment was not
wrong, for he had the material to
go through the year undefeated; but
he could not destroy the dry rot
which spoiled the team, and it fell
down on him.

Now to become specific as to next
year's prospects.

This year’s line started out almost
absolutely green. Ken Rouse was the
only man in it who had ever played
conference football, aside from
Wolff, and the two veterans were
heavily overbalanced by the five nov-
ices. By the end of the season, how-
ever, the line stiffened, and began to
function defensively; it failed ut-
terly on the offensive. A green line
can be brought up to defensive ef-
fectiveness in about two months, and
such was the history of the present
Maroon line, but it takes more like
two seasons to create an offensive
line, chiefly because linemen are nev-
er taught offensive football in high
school, and it takes more time to
learn this branch of the game than it
does the defense.

Cameron and Neff are the only two
linemen who will be missing next
year, and their tour of duty occu-
pied but a part of each game,
chief line prospects for next year
seem to be Weaver and Reeves,
though there is some question as to
whether the latter will be in school.
Weaver, a gigantic youth who would
dwarf Bud Henderson, last year’s
tackle and captain, seems likely to
give both Sol Weislow and Paul Lew-
is a hard fight for their positions.

Given a year’s experience, and for-
tified by this smattering of new blood
Stagg’s veteran line ought to func-
tion effectively both on offense and
defense, and a line that does that
almost invariably means touchdowns.

Captain Wally Marks, Stan Rouse,
and Bert McKinney are missing
from the backfield, but there will be
a number of new men to take their
places, and work out with Kyle An-
derson and Leyers. Gleason, who
was hurt most of this fall, may de-
velop into a powerful bucker and off-
tackle driver, as may Libby, another
half, and Klein, at fullback.

(Continued from Page 1)
however, be interesting to newspaper
readers, most of whom do not know
whether it Ts a safety or a touch-
down that counts two point, if any-
thing, and who firmly believe that
guard plays opposite guard and
tackle opposite tackle.

Styles of football reporting have
changed greatly, like all other re-
porting; between the story of 1900
and 1926 there is as much difference
as the football of then and now. To-
day there .is less of the old blah
about the pretty girls, the velvet
sward, and the embattled warriors
of the gridiron. (I make an excep-
tion in the recent political affair,
and its columns of Army mule and
Navy goat.) You no longer read a
paragraph about the band and its
evolutions. Occasionally an enthu-
siastic M. E. will shoot one of the
pathos gals out to write a feature
about a Red Grange, and the result
is awful to contemplate, but that is
not football reporting.

The point is that, except in un-
usual cases, the “color” story is not
now the chief element of the foot-

ball report. There is less of the |
lyrical quality, too; less of the at-
tempt to get the hip and hooray and
rah into print. Occasionally you
will run across i lead like that which
followed the sad excursion of the
Maroon team to Penn in 1925:

t

“Robed in glory and mantled in mud,
the gallant sons of William Penn.”
But only occasionally.

Mr. Stagg might not concede the
point, but I am afraid that the first
demand in any sports story nowadays
is not accuracy (except in the
score); not profound analysis; not
even how the touchdowns were made.
It is, instead, for a sort of wise-
cracking style that will afford 60
per cent amusement and 40 per cent
information. Ring Lardner intro-
duced that sort of thing, and a lot of
imitators have tried to follow him
since. But they lack Lardner’s rare
ability to be both funny and inform-
ative.

Sometimes the present school of
cycinally smart reporting will sacri-
fice accuracy to the “wow” line. For
what is regarded as real sport writ-
ing just now, not in football only,
is the attitude of sophisticated
cynicism. Name your favorite sport
writers and see if that isn’t correct.

BENSON DISCLOSES TRAINING SECRETS

(Continued from Page 1)
measures is “half cured,” while, on
the other hand, those injuries which
the athlete thinks are “Too slight to
have looked after” and which are
consequently neglected for a day or
two, often prove the most trouble-
some to eliminate.

All injuries brought to the atten-
tion of the department are given im-
mediate treatment. If they prove to
be of a minor nature, necessary pro-
1 ection is applied and the player may
nuite often return to pract'ce at once
should the hurt however, be more
serious and complicated, the team
physician is called. He. then, after
a careful diagnosis determines wheth-

er or not the case can be most suc-
cessfully treated in the training
quarters or if a trip to the hospital
or some X-ray laboratory is neces-
sary. Thus, the best that the science
of modern medicine has to offer is al-
ways available when needed.

The great difficulty of impress-
ing upon the players the necessity
of immediate treatment and proper
care for the first day or two, is
the most discouraging feature of this
first aid work. Only experience, it
seems can convince them of the fact
that but a few minutes of misuse
of a fresh injury does more harm
and retards recovery to a greater de-
gree than would hours of similar mis-

use several days after the injury
has been received.

However, that a few still retain
their faith in first aid efficiency may
be evidenced by the following: A
player had received a rather severe
blow above the right eye. The re-

sult was a highly discolored swell-
ing which almost completely closed
the eye. In this state he came rush-
ing into the training quarters ex-
claiming: “I’ve got to go to a party
tonight and must have this swelling
taken away. Have you time to re-
move it now or later?” After one
good look at his closed optic I re-
plied —“later!”

all; and 234 men participated, of whom
203 were fraternity men. The tourna-
ment ; consisted of five fraternity
leagues, and one club league, consist-
ing of 30 fraternities and 5 clubs.

Winhers and runners-up in each
league were as follows:

League. Winner. Runner-up.

The University championship was
won by Kappa Nu after defeating Phi
Kappa- Sigma, the runner-up, in a
closely contested match. Third place
went to Tay Delta Phi, winners over
Lambda Chi Alpha.

Cold weather caused a number of
postponements until it was necessary
to play the final intra-league matches
under the protection of the new north
stand. The previous matches had been
played in a vacant lot north of the
stadium.

letic directors six years ago. Not all
of the schools were represented at
that time, but since then every one is
now attending. This group is now well
organized, and full of enthusiasm, each
doing all in their power to aid one
another for a better and more compre-
hensive intramural program. Not only
are they striving to benefit one an-
other, but are now gathering all avail-
able material thruout the country in
order to give to other universities, col-
leges, and high schools the results
of their studies. This is a noble pur-
pose, and it is hoped that they can
give all they can to help make intra-
mural athletics a live issue in the
United States.

The above article is but a brief sum-
mary of what is happening in intra-
mural athletics in the Western Confer-
ence, and thruout the country. The
spread of such live issues makes for
strong, vigorous manhood, real recre-
ation, better social contacts, a live
group spirit, better health, more per-
manent interest in sports, and better
scholarship.

( (Continued from page 3)

All matches were played at Jackson
Park 18-hole golf course, but the
greens and fairways were not in very-
good shape. In the team and upper
classman individual event the Pi
Lambda Phi team copped the honors
with a low team score of 155, and the
lowest individual score of 75 made by
Jerome Debs. Rothchild, the other
member of the team, came through
with straight bogey. For the second
and third place honors the Sigma Chi
team, Glynn and McCarthy, nosed out
Koeber and Kurtin of Sigma Nu by
five strokes, giving the silver medals
to Sigma Chi and the bronze ones to
Sigma Nu.

For the freshman champion, Paul
Engberg, of Beta Theta Pi, outdis-
tanced all competitors by ten strokes.
Engberg turned in a very good score
for a cold, raw day when he played,
finishing with a 79, and following in
the footsteps of his older brother, Bob,

(Continued from page 3)

For the first time in I-M history, a
non-fratemity organization, the Bur
ton club, won the swim meet. This or-
ganization embraced many of the best
non-Greek swimmers in the Univer-
sity, and they placed a man in nearly
every race. Chi Psi was second, and
Phi Kappa Psi was third.

In spite of the fast time set in last
year’s carnival, several of those marks
were lowered this time. Dick Hough
of Chi Psi was the outstanding swim-
mer of the meet and high point man.

who was iow golf score man last year.

Gold medals were awarded the low
score man in both classes, and a cup
to the winning Pi Lam teams.

5,000. Illinois University has a new
swimming pool 75x60 with a seating
capacity of 3,000. The University of
Wisconsin is talking of a new pool
and Ohio State hopes to have one
soon..': Most of the high schools in
the east have large swimming pools
and room for large audiences. The
city schools of Chicago are building
pools .75x40 and a few- schools will
have two pools.

Swimming is one of the oldest
sports mentioned in history, and it
is now possible to enjoy it the year
around in most parts of the world.

There are more people engaged ac-
tively in competitive swimming than
any other sport, with the exception
of football. More people participate
in swiming than all other sorts com-
bined. Age size and physical imper-
fections are no handicap except in
competitive swimming. We all real-
ize that exercise is necessary but of-
ten think of it as a dose of medicine.
Swimming as an exercise is that kind
of medicine, which, once tasted, you
want the whole bottle.

Today a club or school is not com-
plete without its natatorium. How
many .fail to point with pride to,
“Our swimming pool,” when showing
a guest about the club or campus?
Swimming is one of the two interna-
tional sports, is the third best paying
indoor college sport, and in many
colleges the only sport that pays for
itself, except football and basketball.

In order to centralize so far as may
be desirable the conduct and encour-

district, the Illinois Fencers’ League
has been organized, with headquar-

one general annual tournament, with
fencing for novices, juniors and se-
niors in all three weapons, besides
special divisions for high school boys
and for women fencers; and has put
into competition two cups for three

With the enlarged space available

Mr. Stagg was captain, coach and
trainer. An interesting practice game
was played over in Washington Park
with a team composed of former col-
lege stars and men from the Y. M.
C. A. college. It was played on Oc-
tober 12, 1892 and the Maroons won
18 to 4. The fullback of the oppos-
ing team was J. C. M. Hanson, now
associate director of the University
libraries but the most remarkable
character on that team was the now
famous evangelist, Billy Sunday, who
played left halfback. At that time
he was combining athletics with his
religious work.

The “pigskin” pastime of 1892 was
vastly different from that of 1926.
In the first place a man could play
his first year in school and besides
could have as many years of compe-
tition as he wanted. For lack of
enough men to play the game, the
coach was permitted to play on his
own team. The game was all running
and kicking as the forward pass was
not known. The gaining of yardage
differed also—a team had to make
five yards in three downs. This rule
wasn’t changed to ten yards in four
downs until 1909

Let us glance over the ravages of
time and see what has happened to
that first football team, McGillivray
and Ruhlkutter are dead. Connover
is a ranchman out in Oregon; Bren-
nemann is a doctor in Pittsburgh;
Smith is Professor of Chemistry at
Lewis Institute; Knapp is a Wiscon-
sin farmer; Wyant is an Englewood
physician; Chase is a Chicago law-
yer; Waycroft is director of Physical
Education at Princeton; Rapp when
he got out of school married Schu-
mann-Heink, the famous German con-
tralto; and lastly we have the “Old
Man” who has remained to serve the
University for thirty-five years—his
name and record need no explain-
ing.

lected as the best of the four.

the losses they incur, and the meth-
ods of extenguishing them.

When we sailed from San Francis-
co for Honolulu we knew of the law
of gravitation that every thing that
goes up must come down and we soon
learned another law, one of health,
that sometimes everything that goes
down must come up. The tropical
setting of Honolulu with its plants,
fruits, flowers and scenery entranced
us with its incomparable color and
beauty. We visited the sugar cane
plentations, the acres of pine apple,
and inspected the pineapple can-
neries from beginning to end. At the
aquarium we saw not carp, perch or
sun fish, but the many peculiarly
shaped and beautifully colored fish
that inhabit the tropical waters. We
learned something of the history of
the Hawaiians, of the accession of
the isles to the United States, visited
Pearl Harbor and realized the neces-
sity of this much discussed place for
the preservation of the islands as an
American territory. The apparent
peacefulness of the lives of Ameri-
cans, Hawaiians, Japanese, Koreans,
Portugese, and Chinese intermingling
on these islands was impressive.

In Japan we observed many prac-
tices of the manners and customs of
the people that were strange to us.
We saw the old and new Japan, the
one endeavoring to maintain itself
in the swift current of progress set
up by forces that cannot be denied
if Japan is to hold the place it has
acquired as one of the important na-
tions of the world. It was interest-

ing to see the
tion wrought
1923 in which
twenty miles
wide between

extent of the destruc-
by the earthquake of
habitations in an area
long by eight miles
Tokyo and Yokohama

were completely destroyed and the
rising of a new and modern city,
from the ashes. In our journeys
through Japan the charm of the coun-
tryside and the oriental architecture
of the many shrines temples and cas-
tles filled our days with interest In
Tokyo, the methods of Japanese
handiwork in the making of clois-
sone and damascene art, and the
making of silk were shown and ex-

BY JIMMIE WEBSTER

(Continued from page 2)

I can not describe the joy that

was manifested when our wireless
operator announced that they had
been found.

In Japan everything was new and
.almost unreal. However, the next
thing that stands out in our minds is
the wonderful way in which we were
cared for and treated by the Nip-
pons. Had we been royal visitors we
could not have been shown more
kindness or respect. Among other en-
tertainments given for the Chicago
party was a banquet held in the room
in which the powers decided to enter
the World War.

However, after all is said and done
there was no thrill on the whole
trip that measures up in any respect
to that experienced as we stood on
the deck and watched the shores of
America rise out of the Pacific and
welcome us home from a trip whose
value can never be fully realized.

plained to our party. In Kobe we
viewed the making of the famous Sat-
suma china. We could not help but
notice the multifarious occupations
engaged in by men, women and chil-
dren to gain a livelihood, and the
work of the coolies who did the work
that draught animals do in this
country.

All these experiences, and many
more, we had to broaden our view-
points on life. In Korea we also
learned much of another people’s his-
tory and mode of living. From an
American on the boat to Kobe re-
turning to his home of twenty-five
years in the Philippines we learned
of the economic value of the Philip-
pine Islands to the United States, the
problems which arise to complicate
the proposal to grant independence
to the Philippines, and the probable
losses to those Americans who have
established themselves on the islands
if independence is granted to the na-
tives.

then (as a sign of revolt)

be-

gins to eat in the Commons, does
not frequent the house as of old,
cuts chapter meetings regularly, and
is seen in company with a pack of
fellows who seem to need haircuts.
He warns others of the insidious pit-
falls of the frat house, think the
brothers are a bunch of bums, and
takes to drinking Alpha Draught
beer rather more heavily than usual.

yHlS sourness is, in a way, I think,
entirely justifiable. No one who
is not in the fog all of the time can-
not every now and then help noticing
that the frat-clubs are not all they
are set up to be for the benefifit of
the poor, damned barb. One may be
very easily irked by one or another
of his brothers; he may not like the
food. He may have “ideas” about
things, and if so, he won’t flourish
particularly in any organization, no
matter how serious the little band of
founders down at bowdoin may have
been about intellectual matters’ way
back in 1-192. Things simply are as
they are, and when incompatible*
meet from opposite sides of the
house grate, something must just
naturally gets knocked off the track.

BUT I, for one, can never accept
disillusionment about a fraternity
at its face value, and as a logical re-
sult of logical proccesses of thought
on the question. Six or eight of us
were talking it over the other night.
Some were unconvinced that a fra-
ternity is any nobler than a Rotary
club or Odd Fellows lodge. Others
stood up for the old frat (theirs),
and said that it had made them bet-
ter men—amen! The rest of us were
merely openminded.

^HE best thought of the night, it
seemed to be, was that which
found utterance in the statement
that those who were disillusioned
about their fraternity were merely
disillusioned in their illusions. They
had come up from high school with
nice ideas about things in college—
the nicest of all about fraternities—
and they had been fooled. So they
soured on the frats. Actually, not
°n the frats, but on their illusions of
them,—but they did not know it, not
having thought things out logically.
They had come to college expecting
the brothers to die for them and the
club—instead, as they should
have, of expecting the loan of a
clean collar, or tooth paste, or some-
fhlng, when they didn’t have it them-
selves. They did not grasp the idea
that a fraternity’s idealism should be
Practical—should operate in terms of
*ttad of lives laid down at the god-
css altar. It’s a convincing enough
argument in behalf of the frats for
lne; as for you, I cannot say.

OUT OF ORDER

Eight Shows Submitted
Competition for
Production

In

Declaring the eight manuscripts
submitted to be the best that Black-
friars has seen for years, the com-
mittee of three judges announced late
yesterday that the script of William

Nelson Fuqua
the 1927 show
21, 27 and 28.

Fuqua, who

had been selected for
to be presented May

is a graduate of the

class of 1925 and is a member of Un-
dergraduate Phi Beta Kappa, wrote
his libretto during the eight months
that he spent in Paris this year. The
plot is laid in the French capital and
describes the adventures of four

American University
men and two women,
one man posing as a

and with

an old maid

students, two
abroad. With
French count
school teacher

a member of the party, Fuqua laid
the scene so that it would be well
adapted to comedy situations.

Chosen for Style

Judges stated that the manuscript
was chosen in preference to the others
largely because of its excellence of
style. Fuqua, while in school, was
the University candidate for the
Rhodes Scholarship award, was a
member of the Honor Commission, a
Senior Marshall, a member of Black-
friars casts for two years and was
active in dramatic work. He won
scholarships in French for four years.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi.

The original title of the manu-
script, “Plastered in Paris” will not
be retained it was announced.

CITY EDITOR PRAISES
MAKEUP OF MAROON,
BUT OFFERS NO JOBS

By WALTER A. WASHBURNE
(City Editor. Chicago Evening Post)

The Daily Maroon has been reaching
my desk regularly for several months,
and, although a city editor of a merto-
politan newspaper is supposed to lx? a
cynical person little given to praise, even
to the deserving. 1 cannot help but con-
gratulate you on your paper.

The schhool of journalism you follow
on The Daily Maroon might well be
copied by any of our local papers in
Evanston, Oak Park, or Cicero, and my
best wish to you at this season is that
you keep up the work.

In the long run there is no profession
in the world, I believe, that is so satis-
fying as ours. True, the work is hard
and the pay is poor, but a person writing
for a newspaper, and writing well, has
the satisfaction of knowing that he is
really doing something, something that
seems more tnagible than posting in a
double-entry ledger.

Many of our best writers and corre-
spondents today obtained their start
“scribbling” for college and school pub-
lications. They are innoculated with the
“journalism bug” and nothing will do
but they take up some form of newspa-
per work. It has been said that a man
or woman once appearing in a stage
piece for a salary always refers to him-
self or herself as “an actor.” The same
might be true about the newspaper pro-
fession, with moderations; once a news-
paper man, always a newspaper man.

“Keep up your good work and when
you have finished at the University, try
for a job on some paper. Incidentally,
my staff is full. ’

With eleven guests, among them
former editors and business mana-
gers of The Daily Maroon, the en-
tire present Staff will celebrate the
publication of the largest edition
of any college daily at a banquet
tonight at 6:30 in the Louis XIV.
room of the Shoreland hotel.

Matrixes will be presented by
Milton Kreines, Business Manager
to members of the staff who have
completed two or more years of
work on the paper. Keys bearing
the seal of the University and The
Daily Maroon, in raised letters,
will be given to the men and pins
of the same design to the women.

FUTURE CHICAGO
RISES TO CLOUDS

Development Plans Aim
Fifty Million Dollars

With a greater University of

for

Chi-

cago planned and with evidences of
the “Chicago of the Future” already
taking form in brick and stone, the
University development committee is
working toward raising a sum up-
wards of fifty million dollars within
the next fifteen years, according to a
statement made yesterday by com-
mittee workers.

Since the inauguration of the drive
in April, 1924, the thirteen million
dollar mark has been topped by $71,-
000, the latest report of the office
shows.

Weiboldt Hall, Whitman Zoological
Laboratories, the new Medical
schools, and the Physiology building
are the first results of the drive. In
addition to these buildings, Swift
Hall and Joseph Bond chapel have
been added to the University through
special donations. On the west end
of the campus, the chimneys of the
new power plant have already begun
to rise, while more projects as yet
unannounced will be seen on campus

Your letter of recent date is re-
ceived, and I am glad to be able to
send a Christmas message to college
men and women through the medium
of The Daily Maroon. I look back
upon my own college days as one
of the happiest periods of my life,
as well as one of the most important.

While undoubtedly the most im-
portant element of college life is
the obtaining of an education, yet to
my mind the acquisition of knowl-
edge should go hand in hand with
the development of the power of in-
dividual thought, the development of
the body by participation in college
sports and the development of hu-
man understanding through contact
with fellow students. I have found
^rom my own experience that the
friendships of college are lasting and
true. The young men and women
who complete a well-balanced college
course are in my opinion best
equipped not only to render real

service in life, but to secure from
the maximum of enjoyment.

With best wishes, I am,

Very sincerely yours,

NICHOLAS LONGWORTH,
Speaker of The House
of Representatives

DRAW STRAWS FOR EACH WING

Breaks Precedent for First
Time In Prom
History

Breaking precedents set by twenty-
two years of practice, leaders of the
two wings of the grand march of
the Washington Prom, drew straws
to determine which section of the
dance cavalcade they would lead on
the night of February 21.

This is the first time in the history
of the University that the apportion-
ment of the wing positions has been
left to chance. Hitherto the Under-

graduate council, in selecting
leaders for the prom, designated
wing which they should head.

Campus leaders last night on

the
the

be-

ing told of the new plan commended
the action, declaring that it was a
step toward making the prom a bet-
ter affair, representing a good time
for the campus.

THIS SPECIAL ISSUE
IS THE LARGEST IN

MAROON HISTORY

Today’s edition of The Daily
Maroon tops all previous records for
size on campus here and is probably
the largest edition of a college paper
that has even been printed. Years
ago when the Maroon was young and
John Ashenhurst, now a staff mem-
ber of the Evening American, was
editor, the greatest feat of the year
was to publish an eight page edition.

A little later a twenty-four page
edition smashed the existing records,
then came a forty-eight page num-
ber.

Colleges

“One of the finest things about
Blackfriars is that it is built largely
on sentiment,” Hamilton Coleman,
the veteran director of the Friar’s
production, declares. He further
states that Blackfriars compare fav-
orably with similar organizations at
other universities and hold their own
by reason of their splendid fellow-
ship.

According to Mr. Coleman, Black-
friars fosters sentiment and their an-
nual production marks a homecoming
of alumni that is one of th^ most
spontaneous and friendly expres-
sions of feeling during the year. In
reviewing the history of Blackfriaw
since his advent as coach, Mr. Cole-
man places the writing of worthwhile
songs for the University as the out-
standing accomplishment of the Or-
der of Blackfriars.

Laud* “Naughty Ninetiea”

Mr. Coleman believes that the most
pronounced hit of any of the Friar’s
productions was “The Naughty Nine-
ties,” presented in 1919 and written
by “Teddy Linn.” He awards “We
Are Chicago,” by Norman Reid, the
place as the best single song pre-
sented by Blackfriars.

The music for “The Naughty
Nineties" was written by Lew Fuicks
who is now a successful song writer
and pianist. Lew also played the pi-
ano in the Blackfriars’ productions
for three years and directed the or-
chestra for two, these being the only
times that a student has ever direct-
ed the orchestra.

Seek Improvement

Blackfriars constantly seek to im-
prove their productions by introduc-
ing new features and new methods
of training and production. The
dancing class, to be started this year,
is one of these innovations.

“The present year suggests more
progress and real competition in the
writing of manuscripts than we have
had in many years. I look forward
to a more unified effort this year and
a better and more interesting play,”
says Mr. Coleman. He also hopes to
see a time when there will be a stu-
dent art school to design and pre-
pare all scenery and costumes and
when there will be a student orches-
tra to furnish the music for the an-
nual productions, both of these or-
ganizations being under the perman-
ent guidance of the University.

Old Campus Dramat
Stars Now Famous

On Stage, In Press

That participation in college dra-
matics means something more than
a good time is evidenced by the for-
mer presidents and leaders in th 3
dramatic association who have be-
come highlights in the world of play
criticism, playwriting and acting.

Among the presidents are Barrett
IL Clark ’12, who has won interna-
tional fame as a dramatic play critic,
Donald Breed, ’13, author of “The
1 urple Dream,” recently produced in
New York, and William Ghere, ’24,
"ho has been playing heavies in a
stock company.

Former members of the association
"ho have won the limelight are Car-
hn Crandall and Kathleen Wallace,
Loth of whom are now on Broadway
and Lewis Beech, ’12, author of “The
Loose Hangs High” and Ann Broom.

By FRED HANDSCHY

That it could hold even the super-
ficial young men seated in small
groups on the side-aisles, inhibiting
their almost inevitable wisecracks is
real praise for the performance of
“The Youngest” in Mandel on De-
cember tenth.

The production was the debut of
the new permanent stage set recent-
ly purchased from the surprisingly
well-filled coffers of the Dramatic
Association. Certainly it was a wise
and a sound move, that purchase, a
fact confirmed by the result. It was
well used, and well lighted, thanks
to the talents and the efforts of
George Downing in whose presence
the university is undeniably fortun-
ate.

Written Seriously

“The Youngest,” like “Young
Woodley” was written more or less
seriously; it treats the tragic prob-
lems of youth, in their inconsiderate
envorinment. To attend a perform-
ance of the latter play is to realize
the futility of trying to present these
tragic youthful problems as they are.
True, the environmental background
is more in the comedy mood in “The
Youngest,” but still the hero repre-
sents a problem, and a sad one. Ah
audience uneducated beyond the sit-
uations of “Seventeen,” however, is
unwilling to accept the true inter-
pretation. They want farce, and
now and then they get it in the local
performance.

Russ Whitney’s very natural and
very much himself, presentation of
the principal role was sympathetic
unavoidably and appealing. Some-
times he seemed a trifle stupid rather
than innocent, but on the whole his
performance was more than good.
The fact that he delivered the appar-
ently insipid love-lines in the third
act with such sincerity as to preclude
the possibility of a patronizing laugh
is his guarantee of dramatic force.

Ruth Pleating

Ruth DeWitt was wholly likeable
as the breezy Nancy Blake, in spite
of an occasional nasality which was
not ingenues. Marion McGann, new
here this year brought a delightful
voice (an important item on any
stage) which in itself was better
than any speaking voice I heard in
the four years I was in college; she
was a pleasing foil for the leading
persons of the play.

Al Irwin, who has been hiding his
talents under a bushel basket of
musical responsibility for a long
time) emerged as one of the most
convincing and enjoyable actors in
the play. Eleanor Metzel gave new
evidence of her poise; her otherwise
creditabl performance was some-
what hampered by the persistent
Easter-bunny gesture of her arms.
Jack Stambaugh was, as before, rath-
er hurried and violent though compe-
tent; Dorothy Simpson gave a true
interpretation of role that was so
difficult as to annoy the audience;
Hadley Kerr was colorless, but audi-
ble.

The smoothness and finish of the
entire production was unusually good
the ensemble scenes were exception-
ally good in the absence of awkward

force. For this easy finish which is
generally reputed to be unattainable
among amateur companies, as well
as for perfect cast-balance we can
thank Mr. Frank O’Hara—to whom
the undergraduate “activities” owe
more than they can know’.

Uniting of Gargoyles And
Tower Players Marked
New Drama Era

The Dramatic Association is en-
tering its third year of united effort
with a record unique in the history
of campus dramatic organizations.

“When in the autumn of 1924 the
Gargoyles and Towtr Players joined
to form a single Dramatic Associa-
tion,” states Charles Cowan, treasur-
er, “the new organization recognized
an indebtedness contracted by the
old dramatic club and reaching back
five years or more. By the middle of
its first year, the Association had
paid all debts, put on every produc-
tion to a profit and had a surplus in
the treasury. In 1925, the Associa-
tion and its friends expended nearly
$300 for furnishings for the Tow-
er Room. This year, the Association
purchased <unit scenery for Mandel
hall, at a cost of more than $400.

“With finished productions of mod-
ern dramas,” Jack Stambaugh presi-
dent declares, “and the inauguration
of the Playfest, the Dramatic Asso-
ciation has contributtd both enter-
tainment and cultural opportunity.”

Hamilton Coleman

Friars Coached by
Coleman Since ’15

Hamilton Coleman and Blackfriars
have been synonymous for the past
•fourteen years.

The first show to be directed by
Mr. Coleman was “The Student Su-
perior.” which was produced in 1914.
Through these years the term “esprit
de corps” has come to have a splen-
did significance for Mr. Coleman in
connection with Blackfriars.

FORMER DRAMATIC

STAR AIDS FRIARS

Frank Parker Returns After
Years of Study Abroad

Frank Parker has returned to his
little grey city in the west to teach
the boys in Blackfriars how to dance.
Mr. Parker is a former star of the
Dramatic Association having appear-
ed in many of its productions, includ-
ing the first American presentation
of Bernard Shaw’s “Press Cuttings”
and was a star of several successive
Blackfriar shows. After leaving the
University Mr. Parker toured for
more than two years with Pavlowa in
the United States and in South Amer-
ica.

He left her company to serve
in the World War. Thereafter he was
with the Adolph Bohn Ballet, then
for two years with John Murray An-
derson productions in New York City
and London. Mr. Parker has studied
with Ceccetti, the teacher also .of
Pavlowa and Nijinski and other Rus-
sian dancers of note, with Adolph
Bohm, and with Dalcroze. He has
also studied Japanese dances with
Madame Kamora of Tokio.

“The real thrill of my days on
the stage,” said Mr. Parker, “came
when I danced in London on a pro-
gram which also included Ellen
Terry, Forbes Robertson and a
group from the Comedie Fran-
caise.”

Mr. Parker has recently staged
ballets and dance features and was
for some time a member of the fac-
ulty of Principia College, St. Louis.

Dancing, besides being the
world’s most popular form of com-
mercialized indoor sport, is now
nothing less than a university course
and Blackfriars, besides being the
producer of the world’s most popu-
lar amateur music comedies, accord-
ing to Phil Watrous, Abbot, may now
be considered the sponsors of a great
movement toward poise and fancy
gracefulness among undergrads.

At least this is the idea which has
been broadcasted more or less offi-
cially from the coop behind the cur-
tain, known to campus as the Black-
friars office.

Joe Barron Coaches

The class will start with the open-
ing of winter quarter under the per-
sonal direction of Joe Barron, cam-
pus clog star, Orpheum buck and
wing performer and what have you.
It will run from 1:35 to 2:05 four af-
ternons a week and is open to all
students whether interested in Black-
friars or not. It is practically a pre-
requisite to participation in the
Blackfriars chorus, however a num-
ber of steps to be taught will be used
in the production.

This is the first time the Univer-
sity has consented to offer gymnasium
credit for any work in connection
with dramatics. Friars heads expect
it will bring out much good material
which would otherwise remain under
cover.

Production Is Novel

“We are producing something en-

president. “This revue will be differ-

standpoint of originality, if nothing
else. And we hope that it will be
something else. We hope that it will
be the nearest approach to a perfect
production that Mandel has ever
staged.”

year the'Mirror was the first big pro-
duction to be presented during the
winter quarter, and this year it will
surpass its own record by a month,
opening on the evening of Feb. 11th.

The dancing classes are also hav-

Mirror’s 1926 production was the
first big musical show ever staged
here during the winter quarter. With
this year’s reflections coming a

month earlier and Blackfriars
ting the earliest start in their
tory the possibility of a greater
matic program for the campus
pears imminent.

THE DAILY MAROON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 17. 1926



CHRISTMAS SEASON MARKS CLOSE

OF BIGGEST Y.M.C. A. QUARTER IN

HISTORY IS CLAIM OF SECRETARY

Tom Paul, Milton D. McLean Guide Association Through
Freshman Work, Church Program, Faculty
Meetings, Mixers, Good Times

The Christmas season marks the
close of one of the most active and
successful Autumn quarters in the his-
tory of the University Y. M. C. A.,
according to Milton D. McLean, secre-
tary.

Under the leadership of Tom Paul,
student President and with the help
and guidance of Mr. McLean, the As-
sociation has conducted successfully,
Freshman work, a church co-opera-
tion week, a membership drive, a fin-
ance drive, discussion groups and va-
rious social gatherings.

Direct Freshman

The Freshman work under the di-
rection of Minott Stickney was well
carried out and resulted in the forma-
tion of a Freshman Honor group of
which Mr. McLean is the advisor.
Campus sightseeing trips were con-
ducted in connection with the Y. W.
C. A. and a Freshman Mixer was at-
tended by most of the Freshmen men.

The Church Co-Operation commit-
tee under the chairmanship of Andrew
Steiger laid the plans for, and carried
out a “Go to Church Sunday” the last
week of October. This committee was
also instrumental in developing a con-
tact between the neighborhood
churches and the campus which has
resulted in a weekly church page in
The Daily Maroon.

A Membership Drive under the di-
rection of Kenneth Stott added many
new members to the roll and saw the
inauguration of a plan to establish a
graduate and faculty membership.

Stewart Clark as finance chairman,
has laid plans for a finance drive which
will be held some time during the
Winter quarter. In addition to the

drive among the students the Com-
mittee of Management Finance Com-
mittee carried on a successful finance
drive among the faculty.

A series of discussion meetings have
been planned to be held in the various
dormitories and fraternity houses dur-
ing the Winter and Spring quarters.

TOM PAUL, President of the “ Y.”

Due largely to the efforts of the chair-
man of the Discussion committee these
groups and the topics discussed at
them promise to be of unusual inter-
est

The Social program of the “Y” has
been a full one. Open houses have
been held every Thursday in the Rey-
nolds club. Refreshments were so
good upon one occasion that the en-
tire “What Of It” column was devoted
to its memory.

A series of weekly parties have been
held at the' homes of the various Fac-
ulty members and University officials.
These parties have always had a ca-
pacity attendance of campus men and
women.

Success of Graduate Arts and Lits
School Lies in Research Work—Laing

BY GORDON J. LAING

The Graduate School of Arts and
Literature was organized at the very
beginning of the University. It has
grown steadily, but it is not in the
increasing number of its registration
that its success can most clearly be
seen. We should look rather at the
research work done and published
by the members of the faculty, at the
journals edited by them (there are
half a dozen of them issued by our
Press under the auspices of differ-
ent departments) and at the long list
of doctors graduated from the school
who are now occupying positions of
distinction in the colleges and uni-
versities of this and other countries.

The Graduate School of Arts and
Literature comprise the advanced di-
visions of all departments in the
fields of the Social Sciences and of
Language and Literature. Admission
to the School is granted to students
having a bachelor’s degree from any
college on the list approved by the
Association of American Universities.

While there are still some courses
open to both undergraduate and
graduate students (e. g. courses in
the 300 group, open to undergradu-
ates with 27 majors, the trend in the
graduate school is distinctly toward
a sharper differentiation between
graduate and undergraduate studies.

Annual Westminster

Banquet January 14
In Hutchinson South

Plans for the annual banquet of
the Westminster Foundation are
nearing completion. January 14 has
been selected as the date and the
South Cafe of Hutchinson Commons
as the place. All students of Pres-
byterian faith as well as the mem-
bers, friends and sponsors of the
organization are invited.

Miss Fay Thornton, chairman of
the arrangaments committee, is plan-
ning for the largest banquet yet
held. Mr. George Campbell and his
“Y” College quartette have been en-
gaged for the evening.

Raise $2700 To
Send Wisconsin
Band To Game

About $2700 was taken in at the
University of Wi^tonsin Homecoming
game for the purpose of sending the
Wisconsin band to the Michigan and
Chicago football games. Four hun-
dred sixty-five dollars were used to
send the band here to the University

and $1400 was returned to the Union
Board for use when they sent the
band to Michigan. A balance of
$933.6u remains lyom the entire
fund.

PUBLIC ASKS MEN
“WHAT ARE IDEALS?”

What are the ideals of students and
wb^t kind of men are the student lead-
ers at a big university? is a question

often asked by people who live in the
smaller communities. As an answer
to this question the “Y” undertakes to
send out groups of campus leaders to
form contacts with the boys and men
of these towns.

In the third week in January a
team composed of an outstanding
member of the football team and two
other student leaders will journey to
New Carlisle, Ind., to speak at a ban-
quet on Friday evening, conduct hikes
or conferences Saturday morning,

speak at boy’s gathering Saturday
night and address a union meeting
all the church on Sunday evening

In this way it is hoped that a fav
orable impression of the University
and its students can be created in the
communities visited.

The idea is to convey through a
representative group of men frOm
the University, a true conception ot
the work of college men. A cording
to “Y” leaders, a false impression is
given by newspaper stories of oc.
casional campus rows.

Religion and Prosperity.

EPISCOPAL

One of the ideals toward which we
are working is the reduction to the
minimum of courses of the purely
informational type in the graduate
school. Such courses belong to the
college and should be taken there.
The characteristic feature of the ele-
ment of constructive work in grad-
uate courses reaches the maximum
in the seminar, the meetings of which
are used for the presentation by
the students of the results of their
work on the problems assigned by
the director. It is also used, although
in a more limited way, in many of
the problem—and research—courses.
That lecture-courses should form
only a very subordinate part of the
work of a candidate for the Ph. D.
degree is coming to be more and
more definitely recognized.

There is still another tendency in
current discussions of the graduate
curriculum, namely the growing be-
lief that graduate students are re-
quired to take too many courses. It
is urged that students who have the
bachelor’s degree from the University
of Chicago or some institution with
equivalent standards, have reached
a point in mental training when
they no longer need formal instruc-
tion on all aspects of their subject,
but should be allowed to cover many
of them by independent study.

Russians Take Up

Bloodthirsty Sport

With bloodthirsty enthusiasm, Rus-
sia is taking up football. A crowd of
more than 50,000 recently watched
the Moscow Football club conquer
the Odessa team, according to the
Columbia Missourian.

Moscow forged ahead in the scor-
ing in the first part of the game, and
then Odessa got busy. Knee-caps
were broken, and several of the Mos-
cow players were carried off the field
unconscious, and then the spectators
finished the job. Play was suspended
until the field was cleared of the fans.

1926 Grid Captain Plans
Military Career

At Academy

Wally Marks, debonair captain of
the 1926 Maroon grid machine, will
apply for appointment to West Point.
Cadet Major Marks is senior cadet
officer of the University Department
of Military Science and Tactics.

Attractive offers of a career in the
movies were spurned by Marks for
the life of an officer.

Appointment Sure

“Wally should have ho difficulty
in securing an appointment if he
wants it,” says Major Leslie P. Mc-
Nair, head of the Military Science
department at Purdue University.
Major McNair has offered to use his
influence to arrange a special ap-
pointment if none can be secured
through the regular channels.

Senator Deneen of Illinois will
probably be approached when the
application is made, which must be
within the next six weeks.

Camp Aida

“Wally is now completing his
fourth year in the Military Science
department,” says Major Barrows,
Professor of Military Science and
Tactics, “with a background of good
R. O. T. C. service in junior units in
the Chicago high schools. He was an
outstanding figure at the Field Artil-
lery R. O. T. C. camp last summer
at Camp Sparta, Wis., both in a
strictly military and in an athletic
way. The camp service showed his
qualifications for the grade of Cadet
Major and secured for him the ap-
pointment.”

At West Point, Wally will be given
a four-year course of intensive train-
ing, and will be graduated an officer
in the Regular army.

No M. S. Grads In
Regular Army; One
In National Guard

As yet none of the Chicago gradu-
ates who studied in the Military Sci-
ence departmest have joined t^e
Regular army, though many ’hold
commissions in the Reserve force,
which can only be called out by ac-
tion of Congress.

Merle Wetten, wno was graduated
in 1923, is a member of the 124th
Field Artillery Unit of the National
guard. While in the University he
was a Cadet Captain and was one oi
the first to graduate after four years'
work in the new department, estab-
lished in 1919.

FOUR COMMISSIONED
OFFICERS AT HEAD

OF MIL SCI DEPT.

Four commissioned officers of the
Regular army are at the head of the
University Military Science depart-
ment.

Major Frederick Barrows is head
of the department and bears the title
of Professor of Military Science and
Tactics. Captain Jewett Matthews, a
Chicago graduate, is assistant profes-
sor. The other two officers are
Lieutenant William Blair and Charles
Gildart,

Major Barrows holds the degree
of Master of Arts from Hamilton
College, and is a veteran of the
Spanish-American and World wars.
He came to the University in 1923
to take the place of Major H. E.
Marr who resigned.

To assist this staff of commissioned
officers there is a technical sergeant,
* staff sergeant, and twelve privates
from the Regular army.

Cadet Commissions
Held by Twenty-

Four Undergrads

Twenty-four undergraduate men
hold commissions as cadet officers in
the University unit of the R.O.T.C.

“Wally” Marks, football captain,
is the ranking student officer, having
been commissioned Cadet Major by
the Military Science officials.

Four men hold commissions as
Cadet Captains. From these four,
Gerald Bench, Eldred Neubauer, Ed-
win Mattick, and Claude Brignall, the
next Cadet Major will be selected.

Eight First Lietutenants

Eight were commissioned Cadet
First Lieutenants: John Chumasero,
Harold Schwede, Francis Wilcox, Vi-
talis Lewis Bassio, Louis Wulfekuhl-
er, Jack Stewart, Maurice Hatheway,
and Joseph Garen.

The twelve Cadet Second Lieuten-
ants are Robert Stern, Ben Patter-
son, Arthur Ernstein, Harold Koer-
ber, Alvin Singer, Paul Beiles, Will-
iam Clarke, Melvin Abramson, Buell
Scace, Bernard Sheehan, Giles Pen-
stone, and Alfred Reiser.

Commissions have been awarded
them for two or more years of con-
sistent work, both here at the Univer-
sity and during the summer in camp
at Sparta, Wisconsin.

MAJOR BARROWS

HASN’T A HORSE

Mount Gets Sick, Then Dies;
Major Tries Walking

Everybody of rank in the Military
Science department has a horse ex-
cept Major Barrows, the senior offi-
cer of the Chicago R. 0. T. C. unit.
Captain Matthews has his, Lieuten-
ant Gildart has his, and Lieutenant
Blair has his, but the commanding
officer’s horse got sick and died last
winter and, as yet, there has been
no appropriation by Congress to get
him another.

Lietuenant Blair calls his horse
“Bouncer,” but refuses to explain
why. Captain Matthews calls his
“ Swede.” In the daily routine of
Military Science department activity,
however, the horses are known by
number.

A student is not allowed to keep
one horse all year because, says Cap-
tain Matthews, he would then leam
to ride a particular horse, not all
horses.

Athletes At Camp

Chicago Representatives at Camp
Sparta Uphold Local
Records

The Chicago R. 0. T. C. represent-
atives at Camp Sparta this summer
had things all their own way when
athletics were concerned.

Fred Hobschied, former track and
football star (also Phi Psi basketball
guard), Claude Brignall of baseball
fame; “Wally” Marks, football full-
back, basketball guard, upheld the
honors of the Maroons against all
comers.

Modern R. O. T. C.

Methods Introduced

Into Schools in 1916

The present system of R. O. T. C.
training was started in 1916, and wae
introduced onto the Uiversity campus
in 1919.

Before the year 1916, schools were
endowed by the War department at
Washington to offer the students
military drill facilities, but no com-
mission in the Regular army, was of-
fered on graduation, and the courses
did not prove popular.

Since 1916, graduates from ac-
credited Military Science units, such
as the one at the University, are com-
missioned second lieutenats in the
Reserve army corps.

LACK OF PONIES

IS A HANDICAP

TO POLO SQUAD

Expect to Continue Practice
On Greenwood Field

Next Spring

Lack of satisfactory ponies have
made polo a subsidiary sport in the
Military Science department of the
University. *

Last year the University made up
their squad from the students in the
equitation classes who, from past
experience, showed themselves to be
superior, and the practice took place
during the regular class hour. The
players were required to keep their
ponies at a walk until they had prac-
ticed sufficiently on the wooden
horses to insure «no injury to the
ponies. Mattick and Morrison were
the outstanding players.

The authorities expect to continue
polo practice next spring on Green-
wood field. Games will be played
there.

From the Major

In many respects the year which is just coming to its close
has been one of the most successful in the history of the Uni-
versity unit of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. The acad-
amic year 1925-26 showed an 84 per cent increase in the output
□f reserve officers over the output of the previous year. Twenty-
six received their commissions this past year.

The record of the Chicago detail at camp was, in the opinion
of the Camp commander, Captain S. G. Brady of the University
of Illinois, the best of the several units represented.

The military ball of last year was, I believe, an enjoyable
affair, and I understand that it elicited much favorable comment
on campus.

There exists in the R.O.T.C. unit a very fine spirit of Na-
tional and departmental service, considerately fostered by the
efforts of Crossed Cannon, the University honorary military so-
ciety.

SIX WEEKS AT CAMP

SPARTA, WISCONSIN

Between the third and fourth
years of military study in the Uni-
versity Military Science department
the student is afforded six weeks’ va-
cation at Camp Sparta, Wisconsin,
with no cost to himself.

Military students from the Uni-
versities of Illinois and Wisconsin
make up the rest of the campers.
Men from the three Universities are
thrown together in order that ac-
quaintance and better feeling may be
fostered between the three schools.

the men from the University held
the baseball and boxing champion-
ships during the summer term last
year.

Until 1922 the camping experience
was gained at Camp Knox, Kentucky.

Local M. S. Men

Give To No Avail

University military students were
afforded no special privileges as far
as the Army-Navy game and its at-
tendant activities were concerned. |

Government equipment valued at
$200,000 has been placed at the dis-
posal of the Military Science de-
partment by the War department
officials.

Seven pieces of artillery, horses
and equipment, topographical instru-
mets, and motor equipment are among
the many things necessary to equip
a department charged with the re-
sponsibility of training soldiers.

A French “75” is the most popu-
lar gun with the students, according
to Lieutenant Gildart, and most of
the artillery instruction is done with
the help of this weapon.

Greenwood field is provided by the
university as a place for riving, and
for longer jaunts the bridle paths of
the parks and the path on the Mid-
way are available. The parks are also
useful in map making.

Stables for the thirty-seven horses
owned by this unit are rented from
the South Park Commissioners.

Special Insignia For
M. S. Officers Based

- On Army Emblems

Cadet officers in the R. O. T. C.
have special insignia to denote their
rank.

In place of the bars used in the
regular army the R. O. T. C. employs
small white disks, one for a cadet
second lieutenant, two for a first
lieutenant, and three for a cadet
captain. The army insignia is one gut
bar for a second lieutenant, one silver
bar for a first lieuteant and two sil-
ver bars for a captain.

A Short Fall

WiU Get You

Into This Club

The Order of the Tumblers it is
called, and most appropriately. For
the latest organization of the De-
partment of Military Science and
Tactics is composed completely and
exclusively of those pseudo-horse-
men who have been precipitated from
their mounts at least once. The first
unfortunate is compensated with the
title of President, the second with
that of Vice-president, and so on
down the line.

The officers for the coming year,
which promises to be a bannqr one
in the history of the order, are:
President, T. C. Potter; Vice-presi-
dent, C. W. Lenth; Secretary, J. R.
Mattingly; Treasurer, E. C. Mattick;
and Sergeant-at-arms, H. T. Parker.

The Order of the Tumblers claims
as its distinguishing asset, that of
exclusiveness, and as possessing such,
is forced to make the entrance re-
quirements exceedingly precise.. To
that end, a potential member must
exercise the utmost grace in the per-
formance of his duty, which is, to
fall from a horse.

NEUBAUER, BENCH, CHILD
BURTIS, COMMAND PROM

Women Selected On Basis
of Activities by MS.

Honor Society

Madge Child and Ruth Burtis were
selected to lead with Gerald Bench and
Eldred Neubauer, respectively.

Miss Burtis became active on campus
early in her academic career, captur-
ing the vice-presidency of the Fresh-
man class. Since then she has been a
member of three class councils, Second
cabinet of the Y.W.C.A., head of the
1926 Maroon week, committee chair-
man on Father’s day, general man-
ager of Mirror, College Aide, secre-
tary-treasurer of the Undergraduate
council, and a member of Quadran-
gler.

News Ed Leads

One of the present Junior Women’s
news-editors on The Daily Maroon,
Miss Child, will be Gerald Bench’s
partner when the grand march is
staged at the cadet frolic. In addition
to her activity on the Maroon, Miss
Child was a committee member for
Settlement, the 1926 track Inter scho-
lastic, Y.W.C.A. Finance, one of the
Blackfriar saleswomen, Program man-
ager for the Mirror production, and a
member of Mortar Board.

ELEVEN MEN IN
CROSSED^ CANNON

Gerald Bench Appointed
Group Commander

Including the men initiated No-
vember 10, eleven men are members
of Crossed Cannon, the honor society
of the Military Sciece department.

Gerald Bench is the commander.

The four men who were initiated
last year with Bench and who are
still in school are William Lenth,
Harold Schwede, Eldred Neubauer,
and John Chumasero.

Six men were initiated last month:
Buell Scace, Harold Koerber, Melvin
Abramson, Ben Patterson, Maurice
Hathaway, and Alfred Reiser.

Meetings are held every Tuesday
evening in the Reynolds club. The
order acts in the same capacity in
the military department that other
honor societies do in the school in
general, seeking to promote the better
things.

One Type of Unit

M. S. Department Offer* Theor-
etical and Practical Mili-
tary Instruction

Only one type of unit is represent-
ed in the Military Science department
at the University, the local depart-
ment being classed as a senior field
artillery unit. There is a unit at Rush
as connected with the University unit.
Medical school but it is not considered

The unit at the University was
founded in 1920 in pursuance of the
National Defence Act of 1919. Up to
that time there was no Military Sci-
ence department at the University, as
the local authorities had not been in
favor of having a department under
the old system of land grant endow-
ment.

Two types of instruction are of-
fered by the University department,
theoretical and practical.

Along the line of the theoretical
instruction courses are offered in mil-
itary history, field artillery ordnance
and material, topography and orien-
tation, motors and motor transporta-
tion, field service and communica-
tion, reconnaissance and minor tac-
tics, gunnery and conduct of fire,
military law, and the military policy
of the United States.

Practical instruction is offered in
equitation (two years), artillery driv-
ing and draft, mounted field artillery
drill, battery commander’s detail,
polo, mounted games, mounted field
days, ceremonies, gun drill, and ele-
mentary gunnery.

Crossed Cannons Selects the
Two Cadet Captains
For Honor

Twice before have the University
cadets checked their spurs and hied
them off to the South Shore Country
club to the first and second Military
Balls. When the classic prom is held
for the third time, Friday, January
21, Cadet Captains Eldred Neubauer
and Gerald Bench will lead. The two
men were elected by Crossed Cannon,
the honor society for students of
Military Science.

The committee is considering promi-
nent orchestras both in and out of
the city. The orchestra last year was
Coon-Sanders, and the arrangements
committee, in charge of the ball, as-
serts that if the Nighthawks are nut
again secured, someone equally well
known and popular will furnish the
music.

Men in Other Activities

Captain Neubauer, a member of
Alpha Sigma Phi, is a staff member
of the Business department of the
Daily Maroon, is on the gym team,
and is a member of Score club. He
was senior cadet officer in the local
unit of the R. O. T. C. until the ap-
pointment of Wally Marks as Cadet
Major. Captain Bench, a member of
Delta Chi, is president of Crossed
Cannons, the military honor society
for cadets. Neubauer is also a mem-
ber of this organization.

The Grand March is unique. Ca-
dets in uniform mingle with civilian
undergrads in dinner coats, and
march with partners through an isle
formed by stalwart cadet officers and
roofed by the crossed blades of their
sabres, and the roses held at arms’-
length by *heir partners.

Lack of Overcoats

Prevents Ceremony
On Armistice Day

There is one article of equipment,
with snappy uniforms, riding boots,
shining spurs, gleaming sabers, and
ominous-appearing guns not forgot-
ten, that the present unit is in dire
need of, and which prevented the
stagihg of a public military ceremony
on Armistice day. Overcoats are sad-
ly lacked by the University’s group
of battery commanders.

Plans were definitely made, the
campus was informed of the cere-
mony and planned to attend, the flag-
raising program was practiced by the
would-be participants, and only a
change in barometrical conditions on
November 11 prevented the military
observance of the holiday from be-
ing staged.

IN WHICH A FROSH

SEEKS COOPERATION
OF BAND, R. O. T. C.

As a freshman on campus, but one
who is definitely interested in the
various activities of the school, and
especially in the work of the R.O.T.C.
corps and the University band, there
has been one thing that has made me
rather wonder during the last foot-
ball season.

The University band appeared on
the field for every football game, in-
tent upon doing its very Jbest, but its
very best does not compare, no mat-
ter how strong school loyalty may be,
with other bands that took the field
to blare forth the strains of the op-
posing team’s Alma Mater. One of
the greatest defects, it seems to me,
was the mistakes made during the
march of the Maroon and white-clad
trumpeters.

What I think would lead to a decid-
ed improvement, and one in which the
officers of the R.O.T.C. might play an
important part, would be for the offi-
cers to supervise the marching prac-
tice of the band members, and work
out plans to form letters easily on
the field.

The hearty pressure of a hand, carries no meaning to the

“spot” cash.

A Merry Christmas, ten years ago, was spelled with Mother,
Dad, food and an open fire. Preceded by a night of small talk,
with a thread of something deeper, this day, of all days meant
happiness to all. Happiness because it held thoughts of loved
ones; because it reflected the spirit of the home.

wE take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently
the communication below, expressing at the same time our
great gratification that its faithful author is numbered among
the friends of The Sun:

“Dear Editor: I am 8 years old.

“Some of my little friends say there is no S^nta Claus.

“Papa says, ‘if you see it in The Sun, it’s so.’

“Please tell me the truth; is there a Santa Claus?

VIRGINIA O’HANLON.

155 West Ninety-fifth Street.

VIRGINIA, your little friends are wrong. They have been af-
fected by the scepticism of a sceptical age. They do not be-
lieve except they see. They think that nothing can be which is
not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia,
whether they be men’s or children’s, are little. In this great uni-
verse of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as
compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by
the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowl-
edge.

Jt|ES, VIRGINIA, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly,
as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and
you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty
and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no
Santa Claus. It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias.
There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to
make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment,
except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood
fills the world would be extinguished.

MOT BELIEVE in Santa Claus! You might as well not be-
lieve in fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to
watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus,
but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what
would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign
that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world
are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see
fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not. but that’s no proof
that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the
wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.

SOU MAY tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the
noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world
which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all
the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith,
fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view
and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real?
Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abid-
ing.

SANTA CLAUS! Thank God; he lives, and he lives for-
ever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten thou-
sand years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of
childhood.

From the Nctv York Sun of 1897

Not so today.

71f HE college man and woman thinks in terms of smart roadsters
v with contrasting coon coats; in terms of diamond rings and
platinum links; in terms of “one better than my best friend.”
, Minimum terms are, as a matter of fact, higher than Dad can

afford. But, of course, he wouldn’t admit it. And as for Mother—

Have you ever considered the real meaning of “Merry Christ-
mas?” It doesn’t mean Santa Claus; it doesn’t mean expensive
gifts; it doesn’t mean a “field day” with the old crowd nor a stack
of greeting cards. It means Mother and Dad.

, And the meaning is not that ascribed by florists to Mother
ov tobacconists to Dad or Santa Claus to Christmas, but rather
something that makes the mind incoherent and the pulse stronger.

And yet we are complacent with the new order.

E let Mother and Dad play Santa Claus on a scale that grows
higher every year. We even let them play Santa to our

Another Quarter Paesm

HE FALL QUARTER of the year 1926—this quarter with
which we have been so familiar—is about to resolve itself into
stacks of dusty term papers, small ink-marks in the Bureau of
Records, old files of The Daily Maroon and formless memories of
way-back-when. The days have precipitated themselves past us
with unexpected haste. The end of the quarter surprises us into
retrospection.

J|T has been a good quarter. The undergraduate affairs, always
the center of noisiest interest, have again gone through the
cyclical round. They have been criticised, as always, and—they
have had obstacles, but the fact which looms is that they have
gone on, and flourished. The football men have played the game,
and played it hard. The Daily Maroon has come out every day
with highly creditable issues. The vacant stretches around the
campus have resounded daily with the shouts of Intramural ath-
letes. Settlement Night has prospered. And so on.

frrHESE “campus” things have come and passed, with approp-
w riate fanfare of editorial and conversational trumpeting. But
they have been the higher pitched notes in the symphony which
might, with an effort, be compared to the whole life of the Uni-
versity. The deep, sweeping rythms have been the rythms of
work. Classes have met with their old-time regularity. The lib-
rarians have been flooded with book-slips. Papers have been
written.

Quiet men in their obscure laboratories and offices have ad-
ventured with new concepts and modified the old ones. The Uni-
versity’s work has gone on. The school is a quarter older and a
quarter wiser.

HERE has been improvement, too. Undergraduate spirit has
W reached a new pitch. The faculty is larger. The President’s
office announces new gifts. New buildings creep upward. More
students seek admission. Things look well.

It has been a good quarter.

Copyright, 1926, by The Chicago Herald and Examiner.

Mason's Research
Plans Unite All
In Creative Work

Sometimes a college student is compelled b y necessity to work his way and serves other
students who pay the waiter’s checks with father’s checks.

But the working student’s early servitude While too often in later years the more
is seldom a check upon his later abil-	fortunate student is still waiting for

ity to write a good check—	father’s check to check starvation.

By MAX MASON

President of the University

The program before the Univer-
sity of Chicago is that of increased
excellence in all the enterprises in
which it engages. This means a
sharpening and strengthening of ef-
fort within its various divisions—
the graduate schools, professional
schools, and undergraduates. In this
program one division of the Univer-
sity will not be strengthened at the
expense of another; but on the con-
trary, every effort will be made to
secure such organization and
strength of performance that each
division will profit from the strength
of the others.

Scholarship for Undergrads

It is our program to knit more
closely the spirit of scholarship into
the life of the undergraduate col-
lege. I do not mean by this that only
those students should be admitted to
the undergraduate college who intend
to become graduate students and spe-
cialists. I do not mean that “stand-
ards are to be raised” in the usual
sense of that phrase. But I do hope
that through careful experimenta-
tion, methods may be found by vir-
tue of which the undergraduate stu-
dents, particularly in their junior
and senior years, may have oppor-
tunity to discover that participation
in the intellectual life of the world,
is a vitally human, dramatic, and
adventuresome experience.

Opportunity Word of Chicago

To many students in the senior
college, opportunity may well be
given to assist in the great research
enterprises on the quadrangles. I
hope that the great body of under-
graduates may feel that opportunity,
and not compulsion, is the word in
this UniveraWy. We are vitally i

terested in the undergraduates at the
University. We hope from them an
equal interest in the work for which
the University exists.

IES FOR DRESS
CLOTHES

For almost every occasion
except a formal evening wed-
ding and opera box or a dip-
lomatic banquet, a dinner jac-
ket may be correctly worn.
But on those few occasions
when it is absolutely neces-
sary to wear dress clothes, a
man must be correctly turned
out or he looks as though he
hired his clothes and knew
nothing about the etiquette of
evening dress. The first and
most important thing is the
choice of collar and tie which
should be of the cut shown
above. The tie is necessarily
white of washable pique and
the collar a wing collar with
wide opening, that is mod-
erately high. Next in impor-
tance is the shirt which
should always have a plain,
stiff bosom with one or two
button holes for studs which
should preferably hold pearls
or imitation pearl studs. Then
the waistcoat is very impor-
tant. It should be of a white
washable pique and the edge
of the waistcoat should in no
case fffTI betowdhejine AT the

should always be worn wn
dress clothes and a white
flower in the button hole will
add a smart touch

Maroon Receives
Sundry Letters
On Xmas Edition

No special message at this time,
except to wish all those connected
with the University a Merry Christ-
mas and the greatest success in the
New Year.”

This quotation from the letter of
Mr. Trevor Arnett (the man who
reorganized the finances of the Uni-
versity) is typical of many that came
to the Maroon office in answer to our
invitation to write for this edition

Many prominent persons—most of
them alumni or former officials of
the University—were asked to con-
tribute. Many of them answered us
with articles, most of which are now

unable to write, due to those rushes
of work which tie up men and wom-

Mrs. Coolidge’s secretary: “It
is her established policy not to write

From the equerry to the Prince of
Wales, “His Royal Highness appre-

STUDENTS AND FLATTERY

By GEORGE

SHERBURN

* LMOST ANYONE can lead a horse to water, but to make a brute
A imbibe—there’s the whole task of education. To accomplish
the end desired—well, as Chaucer said (of a quite different
latter^ “in sondry landes sondry ben usages.” But the usage most
common at the well of knowledge is flattery. You didn’t dream your
beloved instructors flatter you? Daily and hourly they do! They
constantly try to cajole you into drinking from the Pierian spring.

Deep in your heart you tell yourself that though you may not be a
winner in a beauty contest, a potential Phi Beta Kappa, or an All-
American tackle, you have INDIVIDUALITY. There is something
within you, you feel, not always hidden, that deserves to be marked
“very special.” At this something educators aim their flattery; you
wish to be an individual case; you desire
“verv special” treatment. Hence is born
advice to students, and as your thirst for
flattery increases the number and variety of
advisers increases: deans, greater or less;
departmental advisers, advisers in activities,
coaches, departmental secretaries, and un-
official “students’ friends,” all of whom have

as their duty the task of making you feel
that they take an interest in you. They con-
verse with you, some at length, some shortly;
but fundamentally the method is identical.

YOU ask your dean for a course in adver-
tising. He counters with an offer of one
in “aesthetics.” The word is new,
strange, and alluring. “Yes,” the dean says,

George Wiley Sherburn. Professor of
English, makes an astonishing admis-
sion.

Prof. Sherburn has been instructing
in the English department of the Uni-
versity since 1911. .After these years
of guiding young lives he comes for-
ward with the admission that they have
been led by means of cajolery and flat-
tery, and tells the students how to pro-
tect themselves against such flattery.

‘it’s a good substitute for advertising—almost the same thing from

one point of view’. And (this with a wary look at you) just about
what you personally need.” Well used to flattery you take this last
as compliment, and “sign up” without further question.

What I suggest that you do about it is to meet all these “friends”
and advisers half way—make yourself competent to take advice from
them and to know’ when their advice is sound. How’? Well, the
Press prints annually some tons of pamphlets, a few ounces of which

will tell you all you need to know about this University. Don’t be
content with a Time Schedule! Study the Undergraduate Handbook!
Get the Announcements of Courses for the year, and study them.
Don’t ask your dean or adviser what you should take—tell him!
But ... be sure first that you know. It’s not hard to find out after
a bit of intelligent reading. Meet your dean on equal terms; show
the departmental adviser that you know exactly what his old sequence
requirements are and that you’ve got your courses all picked
logically and legally. There is more joy in the office over one such
student than over the ninety and nine that docilely submit to have
their courses dean-picked for them.

help a man get what

THEN patronizing flattery goes by the
board. Dealing is on the level—on equal
terms, and you cease to pine for “very
special” treatment. A few days ago an un-
dergraduate completed his entrance arrange-
ments for this University under “Plan B.”
(I know you never heard of “Plan B” any
more than you did of the Pierian spring:
never mind.) His dean made out a course
for him in English and then ’phoned me to
talk the plan over with the student. There
proved to be no necessity for talk. Before
the man reached me he had been so well
treated that as he left Cobb 303 he remarked
(quite formally) : “In the state university
that I’ve attended for three years they
wouldn’t remove the least bit of red tape to
he wants. He’s one of thousands, and must

expect to be treated as such. It’s a pleasure to feel that I’m getting
into a place where they treat you as an individual.”

If he continues to understand the “system,” he will continue to
feel that w’ay about Chicago. It’s the people who want to be “per-
sonally conducted” to the well of knowledge (alias “Pierian spring”)
who w’on’t bother to understand that all the “profs” are after is to
get them to drink of it.

THE PROFESSORS AT THE BATTLE OF BULL RUN

By ARTHUR P. SCOTT

MY TRAINING as a big game hunter was largely confined to
shooting the gophers that were devastating the fairway at
our golf club. However, I decided if I could hit a gopher, I
could hardly miss an elephant, and fortunately for myself, the
theory proved sound. It w*as up in the unexplored mountains
north-west of Lake Edward in The Belgian Congo that Mr. and Mrs.

Bradley gave their academic friends—Professor Bigelow of the Law

School and me—the chance to deal with solid

room. By a combination of good fortune
and hard work, ten days in elephant coun-
try had given each member of the expedi-
tion an elephant. Another day’s march and
we might not see any more. Bigelow and
I, with another elephant apiece on our
licenses, decided to stay behind the expedi-
tion for one more day.

While natives scouted the country to
locate game, I went out to look after the
tusks Ix'ing chopped out from my first ele-
plant. As I started for camp I met my
distinguished legal colleague escorted by sev-
eral genial cannibals from a nearby village,

ivory outside the class

Speaking of big game—

Mr. Scott took his A.B. degree at
Princeton in 1901. was an instructor at
the Syrian Protestant college. Beirut,
from 1901 to 1907. won his master's de-
gree at Princeton in 1903. and came to
the Chicago Theological seminary’ in
1910. From 1913 to 1919. when he took
his doctorate of philosophy. Mr. Scott
was an instructor in history at the I ni-
ver-ity. Hr became an assistant pro-
fessor in 1919. and has been associate
professor of history since 1923. Mr.
Scott is the author (if ’’The Introduc-
tion to the Peace Treaty.'’ How’s that?

all on the way to some elephants reported
about half an hour’s walk distant. Through
a heavy rain, we scrambled up and down
steep and slippery footpaths until we
reached the neighborhood where the ele-
phants had been feeding for some hours.
The animals pay little attention to natives,
but the sewnt of white men usually alarms them, and an approach
upwind is always attempted. Fortunately the rain stopped, and we

prepared for action.

THE OPEN GROUND sloped down to a little wooded stream
bed, beyond which a hillside rose steeply. High up the slope
were some banana plantations, and a number of interested
natives looking down on the drama on the successful outcome of
which depended their meat supply for weeks to come. Sure enough,
we could make out several huge forms among the bushes, a flapping

ear. a raised trunk, the curve of a back—but even with the field
glasses not a glimpse appeared of the ivory which must mark the
bull which it was both legal and worth while to shoot,

We followed along as patiently as we could while our elephants
slowly drifted to the left, still keeping in the tall bushes, while the
natives above rolled rocks down the hill. We were dubious about

the wisdom of flushing a covey in that fashion but the situation was

largely beyond our control. At last in an open space a large head

with indubitable tusks came out. By prear-
rangement Bigelow fired first, then I, and
down went the elephant. In a second two
more bull elephants dashed out. All I can
remember is a quick decision that the last
seemed to have bigger ivory, and I fired the
other barrel of my .475 rifle at the side of his
head, without bringing him down. Mean-
while the first elephant had gotten to his
feet and was making off. We fired as long
as anything was in sight, and then regarded
the empty battlefield with feelings of
chagrin.

PRESENTLY, however, we dashed off
after the first elephant and within a
quarter of a mile a survey from a tall
ant-hill revealed him on his side. Another
shot from the great authority on property,
and all was over. Before we had begun
to congratulate ourselves on this success, a
that the other elephant was down but

native dashed up and reported
not quite out. “Yes, sir,”

said I, anticipating a song hit of the fol-

lowing year, “That’s my baby!” Going back we found the trail
where my elephant had dashed off through a swamp and presently

saw him, unable to get up. Several shots, from as close a distance as
I thought consistent with my obligation to be teaching the following
summer, and all was over but the photographing. And as we tramped
campwards through the gathering dusk to what we regarded as a
well-earned rest, we agreed that it had been a lucky day for the
academic amateurs.

M the current year were pub-
two volumes of The Letters of
alter Raleigh, who died in 1922.
He was a distinguished scholar, author and
professor in the field of English literature.
Some years ago he was lecturing in this
country and a Princeton professor was to
meet him at the station when he arrived for
a lecture at Princeton University. The
American had never seen Sir Walter and
when the train arrived tried to pick out a
man who looked queer enough to te both a
Britisher and a college professor. He ap-
proached a man and said, “I beg your par-
don, is this Sir Walter Raleigh?” The man
thus addressed backed away slightly, looked
astonished and replied, “N-n-no. No! I

am Christopher Columbus. Sir Walter is in

the smoking compartment conversing with Queen Elizabeth.”

Since his appointment a little more
than a year ago to the position of Dean
of the Colleges of Arts, Literature and
Science. Chauncey S. Boucher has been
forced to shelve most of his activities
in the field of American history. Mr.
Boucher came to the University from
\\ isconsin in 1923. If the book, which
he has half finished and has put aside
until his work as dean is ended, has
anecdotes and stories as good as these,
we will surely own a copy, even though
it is history.

WHEN the Democrats, after a long
period of being in the minority jn
Congress, at last had control in I893,
94 and set about to frame a tariff bill, the
Republicans had long insisted that the tariff
should be handled bv its friends, the Repub.
licans, and that the Democrats knew nothing
about the question. At one stage of the
debate on the bill it was discovered that one
item through some mistake had been put jn
the wrong schedule. A Republican senator
immediately seized the opportunity to re-
mark: “Since the framers of the Wilson
Bill have classified hydraulic hose in the
schedule for wearing apparel, they have
doubtless remodeled that very strange meas-
ure so as to include hydraulic rams and
live-stock schedule.”

WHAT ARE THE FACTS?

on the daily newspaper sport staffs who are intelligently versed in
technical football and that the average account of a game in Satur-
day afternoon’s final editions or in Sunday morning’s paper is neither
accurate nor skillfully written, from the standpoint of technical
football.

I have no argument to make with Coach Stagg. In this instance
he is dead right. Football, as reported in the daily newspapers,
even in the leading newspapers of the country, is rather shamefully
handled.

There are certain excuses that may be made for the sport writer,
some of which the reader does not understand, but much of the rot
that is written in the name of football news is extremely boresome
and slipshod writing.

One of the reasons for this poor handling of football is that very
few sporting editors are college men. The number is increasing
each year, but the varsity alumni who manage the sport department
are still in the minority. The average sporting editor knows his
baseball, his boxing and his horse racing, but to him golf, tennis,
baseketball, football and track athletics are a closed book. He must
handle them, but he takes little interest in how they are covered
and does not know a good reporter in these fields from a bad one.
I doubt if out of one hundred leading sport editors in the country
if thirty have the slightest knowledge of the difference between a
touchback and a safety, what “dormie” means in golf, the difference
between a technical and personal foul in basketball, what constitutes
a foot fault in tennis, or whether :48 or :58 is good time in the quar-
ter mile.

And some of the sport writers who are taken off professional
sports during the short football season of two months in the fall
don’t know much more about amateur sports.

COMING HOME from the recent Michigan-Ohio State football
game at Columbus there were gathered in the smoking com-
partment of the Pullman two football scouts, a couple of assis-
tant coaches and two or three real fans. Off in one corner sat a sport
writer, one of the best known football “experts” in the middle west.
We talked over the game for a couple of hours.

Finally the sport writer got up and ambled off to bed. “You fel-
lows make me sick,” he said. “You talk about a lot of stuff that
the public never sees in a football game. Nobody gives a damn
about the interference, or the blocking, or the strategy, or the de-
fense against passes. All they want to know about is the guy who
made the winning touchdown. He won the game, didn’t he?”

“I have got instructions from my boss not to write anything tech-
nical about the game. I’m just to pick out the guy that made the
winning touchdown and write about him and then on Monday I have
got to write another story about what town he is from, whether he
is good to his folks and some personal color stuff. Our readers eat
that stuff up. I am not allowed to write technical football, and I
couldn’t if I wanted to, because all I can see in a game is what man
makes the touchdowns. That’s the news.”

That’s what the average sporting editor and managing editor
think is the news. The real football fan digests the Sunday morn-
ing paper and is left hungry by its lack of accurate technical descrip-
tion of what took place. The sporting editor never heeds this large
element in his circulation. He instructs his men to feed the bunk
to those who don’t know much about football. It is the easier way.
Perhaps it builds circulation. But I have never been sure about
that.

THE PAST
Hy George Leo Gruskin
There is a quiet, weird feeling in my heart

For something 1 once knew 1 know no more . . .
.4 queer little tugging in my throat that gives a start
At memories of pleasures that have been and passed before.
And sometimes I am moved to spend my thoughts in sorrowed wonder
That Life is full of things ice learn to love . . . and then must
leave . . .

Surely God has made up for the larness of this blunder
By making Death a place where we can find the past we grieve.

CONCERNING IMPAIRED
VISION

By FRANK E. BELDEN

(University of Missouri, A. B. '21, B. J. ’22)

ALLOW me to voice a protest against the preachings of all those
who are wont to condemn college education on the grounds
that it “doesn't pay.”

Many men (and women) who have not, for one reason or another,
been to college are inclined to poke fun at the whole idea. As a rule
these people are—well . . . leadership in ANY field is hopelessly be-
yond their reach.

And there are not a few alumni and alumnae—very recently gradu-
ated—who wish they hadn’t “wasted” four valuable years of their
life. These are shortsighted individuals; nearly all of them will soon
arrive at a clearer conception of their university training.

According to my observation, a college education DOES pay.
Some statistician somewhere once proved absolutely that, dollar for
dollar, four years in college are a mighty good financial investment.
They are indeed. With less than one exception in a thousand, they
are directly or indirectly responsible for an increased earning power
which could in no other way be obtained.

Yet this is by no means the greatest advantage accruing from
college training. There are other benefits . . . immeasurable, deep,
intangible benefits. Let me hastily mention a few:

For one thing, there is social contact. No matter how technicala
student’s courses or his later life-work, he must live and move and
have his being in a social world—a world composed of people such
as he has learned to know and mingle with in college.

A second benefit is the broad, general knowledge acquired. How
else would you learn so much! Where else could you learn so many
valuable, interesting facts about so many things!

Thirdly there comes a something which I am at a loss to describe.
This something is manifested in a thousand ways—sometimes as
decency, sometimes as good-fellowship, sometimes as leadership, some-
times simply as those priceless qualities associated with "lady" or
“gentleman” (in the true meetings of these words).

Call this benefit what you will . . . its importance is not to be
measured by my poor powers of description.

In closing, just a friendly word to those who will soon be competing
—economically and in every other way—with persons who have (ap-
parently) a four-year headstart:

Don’t be discouraged or alarmed if, after the first year or so. you
feel that your college years have been wasted. These years are NOT
wasted. The NEXT year or so will prove this to you!

WHERE ARE WE GOING?

Not That It Matters
By FRED HANDSCHY

CkF COURSE the normal aim is to go to bed. All day, from
/ the moment of awakening one works toward that end. He
9 sighs with heavy relief when he gets in; and objects to getting

However the College Person

College people go to bed, eventually. But other things are more
onular generally. Finding sufficient relaxation, not to say actual
sleep, in class the undergraduate is ever on the tear, after places
to go, people to see, etc.

When I Was a Freshman

Then I thought that fraternity parties, house dances, were big,
verv big affairs, affairs of great importance (have you ever tried
to collect the assessments?)—I thought
people came early and left late and had just
one big good time, all being brothers, and
the girls club-sisters, wearing the same ten
to twenty dollar insignia in the name of dear
old so-and-so their common bond and letter-

But Now I Know

HE THING TO DO is to arrive as late
as possible, making an impressive en-
trance with a Southern drawl in sable,

Fred Handschy, who was graduated
with the class of ’26 last June, writes
from much experience. In addition to
four years’ work on The Phoenix, of
which publication he was editor in his
senior year, he was a frequent contribu-
tor to College Humor.

or ritzing the brothers with the Northsider
who was requested to leave Smith because she played hectic bridge
publicly for a tenth of a cent a point. Patronizingly you exchange a
dance with somebody who has entered into the fun in exactly the
same good-sportsmanship as yourself, furnishing an equally inter-
esting specimen from Bryn Mawr (he thinks she has an aristocratic
profile; you know that her nose and mouth just don’t get along to-
gether). When, with full measure of aplomb, you have ignored the
ice-cream suggested as a treat by the brother who sings in the choir,
vou commence to leave, bidding no one good-night except him with
a Chrysler and a nice quiet sort of girl; it’s always a coincidence
that the Chrysler happens to be going your way.

They Don't Ask

“Where are we going?”—they demand it. Maybe it’s the Drake.
Assuming that it’s the Drake and the docile Chrysler, whom you
have condescended to admit to the bigger part of the evening since
it is manned by one in a coonskin coat with not too empty pockets,
you go there and have a more or less quiet evening, while you're
there. You see people from “school,” speak to them with more or
less cordiality than you would on the quadrangles, and dance as if
you thought the hostess (a lady well known) was Marie of Rournania

—perhaps. The Drake is a nice place, and popular. But perhaps you
stop downtown.

And Go to the Blackhawk

HERE ARE a lot of people who are still trying to find out why
So-and-So’s music is so much better than So-and-So’s. Last year
they went to the Balloon Room at the Congress, but now they go

to the Blackhawk, a restaurant which has replaced cuisine with orches-
tra because it is more profitable. There you comment on the music,
and on the way a fraternity sophomore is attending to a club sopho-
more, or vice-versa, depending. You eat, or you do not eat, depending
on the price of the ginger ale.

But at the Frolics

That’s a place where you have waited in
line to hear the same music and see the same
“show” you saw a week ago. Frolics, for-
merly known as “Ike Bloom’s” when it was
less elegant and more interesting is a place
where you are not permitted to play bridge
at your table because it doesn’t look “nice,”
but have you ever sat in the balcony and
watched the people (not, of course, college
people) ? Have you ever watched an elderly
Rotarian purchase a big baby doll (very
similar to his daughter’s baby doll, in Sioux
City) with the air of a grand monarch, for
a baby doll, blonde since last December? Frolics is a place where
college people are welcomed, if they know Jake Adler.

But Those \\ ho Are Studying Sociology

ND OTHERS who are not, visit Plantation with an air of
grave abandon. There the college man may feel as cosmopoli-
tan as he wishes; they are used to him. He is expected to be

eccentric. And perhaps he is; especially if he dances. Self- con-
scious, serious, knowing that he is hearing something hot in music
and having read “Nigger Heaven” he is bound to make the most
of his evening. But does he? Not long after he has arrived, he
becomes a bit bored with mere observation (enervating to the aver-
age) and begins looking for fellow-collegians. He even converses
with people who are in his eleven o’clock. As at the Drake, at the
Blackhawk, at the Frolics, at Plantation, he is looking for the aca-
demic bluebird which he has left behind when he went in search of
adventure.

For the College .Man

Whether he transports himself in some one else’s Chrysler or in
the more expensive Yellow, whoever he is escorting, wherever he is
going, is looking for just that which he complains of at a Reynolds
Club mixer: more college people.

BRIGHTER DAYS FOR HOMER,
THE MAILMAN

By DONALD PLANT

1WISH mightily that, with the beginning of the New Year, the
following concerns would kindly remove my name from their
mailing lists:

A Fifth Avenue clothing company whose representative when visit-
ing Chicago always holds his display in Evanston while I live on the
South Side.

A tobacco company that thinks I haven’t yet found a mixture
which suits my taste.

A monthly magazine that is sure I'm deeply interested in Korea
or some such place.

An insurance company that doesn’t know I haven’t a wife and
children.

Two parishes that are not aware of the fact that I am a baptised
Presbyterian or something like that.

(Editor’s Note: There is nothing like that!)

(Author’s Note: Oh, yes there is!)

(Editor’s Note: What?)

(Author’s Note: What about trained seals?)

(Editor’s Note: That’s right.)

A mechanical milking concern that has the idea that I have a lot
of cows when I haven’t at all.

A moving picture theatre that thinks I like Jack Hoxie and Hoot
Gibson.

A publishing company that is sure I don’t know the finer points
of etiquette.

A man’s shop that thinks I’ll not see the covers of Vanity Fair
unless they send them to me.

“PARIS IS DIVINE?”

By WILLIAM NELSON FUQUA

CENE: Paris. TIME: Any summer afternoon.

An army of weary ladies—all, of course, past sixty—equipped

with guide books and notebooks stumble out of the forty-eight seater
into the court yard by the Sainte Chapelle. Though weary, terribly
weary, from weeks of Churches, Galleries, Views and The Cultural
Delights of Travel, they muster a resigned smile as they think of the
Uplift such a famous place will bring into their lives and of their
joy when, back safely in Oskaloosa, they can say for the rest of their
days, “Why, my dear, you should see that Sainte Chapelle.7 The
guide, though (he’s a fly-bitten looking idiot), has no such consola-
tion as he starts in. (And I’ll say, for your relief, that we guides
didn’t consider this chapel especially hard to do professionally.)

GUIDE: This is the Sainte Chapelle where—

AN OLD LADY: Oh, Mr. Guide, how do you sped it?

GUIDE: S-a-i-n-t-e C-h-a-p-e-l-l-e, built by King Louis XI, Saint
Louis—

AN OLDER LADY: Which mistress’ Louis was he?

A STILL OLDER ONE: Sh!

GUIDE: He built this place to hold one of the few complete
crowns of thorns in existence. Some king over in Constantinople,
dear old heathen, owed Louis a pile of money which he didn’t want
to pay back so he popped the idea of making a crown of thorns and
offering it to Louis in place of the money. He knew the king was a
pious old bird and kind of simple but he hadn’t really thought he’d
fall for a gag like that.

AN AWFULLY OLD LADY (whispering) : Don’t you think he’s
a little sacrilegious?

ANOTHER CENTURY PLANT: Sh, I can’t hear.

GUIDE: And so when Louis got the thing he built this place to
hold it. That was in 1245.

AN ANCIENT DAME: Say, Mr. Guide, just how many years
was that before Columbus?

A STORY THE EDITOR DIDN’T WANT ^

I SAT with the editor’s letter in my hand.

“We had hoped,” said the letter, “that this was going to be one
of your stories of young love. Can’t you hurry one to us to
make up for the disappointment over this?”

I dropped the note to my desk, where it lay in the soft glow of the
reading-lamp between the returned manuscript and a stack of un-
corrected themes. I glanced at that reminder of my night’s work,
looked at the editor’s brief typewritten lines musingly, switched off
the light.

The mellow evening drifted in through the open window to meet
me. ... I wanted to write a young-love story.

But the trouble with those fleeting first-kiss moments is that noth-
ing really happens. Not even the kiss, sometimes. They are as elu-
sive as the vision of an organdie frock down a lane at twilight. And
the trouble with stories is that something has to happen. Any editor
will cell you so. “Put in .some punch,” he’ll
admonish. “Give it a wallop.”

It would have been pleasant to write such
a story; but there wasn’t any to write. Be-
sides, there was that stack of papers to cor-
rect. I knew that I ought to set five blue
pencils in a row and begin on them. So I
took out my pipe, filled it, lighted it, in the
brief flare of the match saw the editor’s la-
conic note.

I turned from the desk and went to the
window. Dormitory lights studded the quad-
rangles; the purr of automobiles came from
the Midway; in a room somewhere above, a
student was whistling. Down on the cam-
pus an occasional cigarette pricked the dark-
ness. The scent of young grass was in the
air. A block away, in the gymnasium, an
orchestra crashed into the first preliminary
for the Spring Hop.

In such a night,

Did young Lorenzo sivear he loved
her well.

On such a night, thought I, a fellow ought to get the young-love
angle. And yet—

“Hello there, F. H.!”

I looked down. A taxi had slipped to the curb. Young Arthur
Crews was waving his hat in playful salute. The light from the
windows fell on his slick, brushed-back reddish hair; his blue eyes
were bright, I could almost catch the bouquet of recent barbering
from his not-too-pink young face. A lithe, happy-go-lucky figure in
white flannels. I returned the salute with uplifted pipe.

“Not going to the Hop?” he simulated surprise.

“Not,” said I.

I marked the sparkle of his eyes, the involuntary flick of his ox-
fords as the orchestra veered to syncopation. I leaned forward. I
had an idea.

“Ever been in love. Art?” I whispered down to him.

His eyes snapped. “Never out!” he laughed; and jumped to the
running board. There he paused, gave me a look over his shoulder.

“But say, F. H.—don't read that theme of mine in class, will you?”
The car spurted, was merely a tail light rounding a corner.

I considered the diminishing red dot thoughtfully. They go in
taxis now-a-nights, at nine o’clock, or ten. Strolling is a lost art, like
waltzes and strawberry socials. Whereas, when I was a boy—But if
Arthur Crews knew the manner of our parties, the songs we sang,
the games we played, the hours we kept, I would be “dated:” a thing
no college faculty man likes to be. For, say what you may about
the “prof,” we do come a little nearer to what all the world loves
than most of you.

Youth! It comes to us vicariously, year after year, wave upon
wave; and one of the easiest things we do is to flatter ourselves that
were’s as young as our freshmen. . . . Oh. I ought to be able
to write that story! Youth, and spring, hemmed me in.

The night held out its fragrant bowl, filled with half-remembered
yearnings. But its essence was as vague, as tenuous, as the per-
fume of a girl’s hair. No punch, no wallop.

So I turned my back on the night and the editor’s request and, with
the desk lamp on, found myself where I belonged, four blue pencils
in a row, one in my hand, and the inevitable themes before me. “My
Neighborhood.” The same old subject—ask any English teacher.
My eyes went furtively to the window; I could hear the slip-slip of
pumps on the gymnasium floor, a patter of hand-claps, in a brief lull
some undergraduate sending his fraternity whistle across campus.
There was a temptation to send the themes in the same general di-
rection. And then suddenly I swung round to the desk, busily fer-
reted through the papers, extracted one. If that debonair young
Crews didn’t wish his paper read to the class, it might be a good one
to start on. There must be something in it. For, oddly enough,
young fellows like Arthur Crews, who in their subsequent careers
will never write much more than checks, have a queer way now and
then of writing frankly to you rather than for you.

This is the story of the O. Henry
award committee of the American Acad-
emy listed as one of the best short
stories of the year. It was not. of
course, Mr. O’Hara’s first story. His
first published fiction, we’ve heard, ap-
peared when he was about sixteen. Or.
as Who’s \\ ho says, he “began writing
in boyhood, and has served as reporter,
dramatic editor and special writer for
metropolitan newspapers and maga-
zines, and is a contributor of short
stories to magazines.” Mr. O'Hara ap-
parently manages to keep up some of
these activities as well as directing un-
dergraduate activities at the I niversity.
and offering courses in drama and pub-
lication writing.

I looked twice to make sure I wasn’t translating my thoughts to
his none-too-legible script. “June.”

I encouraged my pipe, and began.

This is Arthur’s theme:

NOTHING ever happens in Jason City, Illinois. I was born
there, I grew up there, and I know. But one who has spent
his summer vacation there -will never forget the wonderful
nights, especially the nights in June.

Across from our house is a small park with shade trees, flower
beds, and a monument to our Civil War heroes. Close by the monu-
ment is an old fountain, which trickles slowly in the sunlight but at
night seems to flow with a sort of murmuring bubble.

It is just beginning to get dark when the moon appears to rise out
of the trees. In the park everything is quiet except for the crickets
and the little fountain. Stretched out on the
grass and gazing through the trees at the
stars, you forget yourself and your troubles
People pass near you on their way home
but you don’t hear them. Maybe from the
other side of town you’ll hear a dog howling
or an owl hooting, or near by the corner
drug store shutting up for the night.

All at once the height of the moon reminds
you of the late hour—it must be almost
eleven—and you are aroused only to find
yourself in the little park in Jason Citv
Nothing has happened.

For a while, last summer, I thought that
maybe something could happen in Jason Citv
even to the girls who have to stay on there,
all the year: and then I woke up from my
dream, as I had from all my home-town
dreams, in the same park, with the moon
high and the fountain bubbling, and the drug
store already shut up for the night.

I was in the park when the thing that
didn’t happen started. You see, I had come
home fresh from my freshman year. I had
met all the flappers of Foster Hall, I knew their “line,” and I was
sure a summer at home was going to be pretty dull. And that
first evening I went out into the park to listen to the fountain, look
at the stars, and pity myself. I was succeeding well enough, too. A
fellow can be awfully sorry for himself, just staring at a star.

Then, suddenly, I heard steps coming along the path, not unpleas-
antly familiar, and I took my eyes from the star and looked up the
path, and saw coming along it in the moonlight the figure of June
Addis. As soon as I saw her I wondered that I had ever forgotten
her.

I suppose I’ve known June about as long as I've known any girl,
though the first time I seem to remember her was one day in gram-
mar school. I was giving a big party, and had invited everyone in
my room except June. Why? I don’t know. No one did invite June
to parties. I never thought of it. Now, we do a lot of talking in
Jason City about everyone’s being’ as good as everyone else. Actu-
ally, the most thriving thing in town is our class distinction.

We have a new chamber of commerce with the written motto,
“Get Together:” and a new country club with the unwritten slogan.
“Stay Apart.” The club and the chamber of commerce weren’t there
when I gave my party: but the distinctions were.

I REMEMBER how June held her head the day the invitations
came out, and how her curls tossed as she walked out to recess.

But a little later, by accident, I caught sight of her sitting alone
under a tree—I was chasing a ball—and she was huddled with her
head in her arms.

“What’s the matter?” I demanded.

She looked up. startled. “Nothing,” she said. “Sun in my eyes."
But I knew, all at once, and I laughed: “Why, you can come to
my party!”

"I don’t care to,” she retorted with a flip of her curls.

I recollect digging my toes into the grass and awkwardly tossing
the baseball back and forth from one hand to the other. “Aw, c’mon."
1 muttered.

Then she looked up at me with a sort of crooked smile, the kind
that makes a kid feel shy and helpless, coming that, way from a girl.

“Of course I’d love to be at your party,” she admitted, “But I'm
not going to be!”

And of course she wasn’t.

I don’t remember anything more about that party. Right here,
in my mind, June Addis disappears, like a movie fade-out, until high-
school days. Then she reappears in a series of close-ups.

She’s hard to describe, as you'd understand if you ever saw her.
She wore her hair down her back when other girls were trying the
latest done-up styles. She wore a plaid dress and a cape and a tam.

And she wore low-heeled shoes of smart English cut when the
other girls were teetering around on the uncertain support that high
heels and pointed toes gave to their unaccustomed feet. Looking
back now, I know that she was quite unconscious of herself or her

lothes, which is certainly more than one could say for the others.
Those other girls, naturally, didn’t know quite how to take her;
there’s no time when it’s such a crime to be “different” as during
the high school age. Sometimes the other girls made remarks, and
fellows would smile, diplomatically, at their jests. But secretly
Je liked June’s style.

She was a good sport, understood our jargon, was the life of a
botany excursion; and she had wonderful golden hair, and gray eyes,
md pink cheeks; and when she laughed it wasn’t a giggle.

ON OUR Saturday hikes, we’d usually drop by the house where
she lived with her mother on the outskirts of the town; and if
she wasn’t too busy house-cleaning (she had a mania for that)
«he'd join us, and we’d all go tramping across the fields, a bunch
of fellows and one girl! And her dog. That lanky old fellow fath-
ered her, and she mothered him.

Since then I’ve figured that the dog took the place of dolls and—
oh other things she didn’t have. At the time, we took everything
for granted, including the theory that June was to be treated
courteously, as all young gentlemen should treat all women; but that,
also, she was Mrs. Addis’ daughter, and so not “our kind.”

Mrs. Addis talked a good deal, and was a little radical before that
sort of thing was popular with women; but I never quite understood
the why of our exclusiveness.

There was, so far as I could ever gather, no scandal about her.
(hie doesn't need to create scandal to be “out of it” in the Jason
Cities; one needs only to be a non-conformist. And I suppose Mrs.
Addis was just that and nothing more. Anyway, although as we
grew up June was accepted a trifle more freely and invited to the big
parties, she never got into the intimate affairs; and she never saw
the inside of the clubhouse until last summer.

IT WAS June Addis that I saw coming up the path in the park
that first night at home. Her hair, was done up (not bobbed),
and she was dressed differently; but the same June, otherwise.

“Hello, Art,” she said, shaking hands with a grip. “Do we all
seem pretty stupid after your year of college?” I thought there was
a little note of longing in her voice as she spoke the word. June al-
ways used to dream of getting off to college, herself.

“This is my first evening at home,” I came back, “and the folks
I'm meeting to-night—”

"Come on. Art!” she cut in. “That isn’t the way you talk to old
friends. Just leave out the compliments and say you’re glad to see
me!”

I said it. Also, “You’re looking fine,” I said.

“Am I?” she said, just as eagerly as when she was a child.

"I'll say you are. I’m going to walk home with you—if you don’t
mind!’’

She looked at me quickly, as if surprised, and then glanced up the
street. There were headlights coming, and it was Dan Shorely’s
roadster. (Dan’s father is president of the other bank, and Dan
had recently got back from his freshman year East.) The roadster
glided up to the curb and stopped. Dan leaned out, waved a hand,
and then opened the door. And June Addis got in beside him, and
waved her hand at me, and they drove away.

1	stood there feeling sort of dumb. Of course June hadn’t really
been rude, and Dan was always a devil-may-care fellow. I wasn’t
peeved. I was startled.

Here were the old social distinctions all shot to pieces in Jason
City. While the son of one bank president is asking to see June
Addis home, the other president's son drives along and takes her!
And she had been expecting him. 1 began to reflect what a great
thing a university training is. Of course it was the broader out-
look of our college year that had made Dan and me see things
straight.

June was a peach of a girl, and one radical mother more or less
didn't make any difference.

There may be a question about the relative merits of East and
Middle West in football, but when it comes to picking off the prettiest
and most interesting girl in a town where nothing happens the East
imparts a finesse. I didn’t see much of June Addis last summer.
Not till the day of the Country Club ball. That comes late in the
season, and is the big annual event. Catering from Chicago, ditto
flowers, ditto orchestra. A grand, a very grand occasion in fact.

The whole town plans for it for weeks and months ahead; all the
girls and most of the older women have new gowns; dates are made
long before; and, of course, who takes whom is regarded as of the
greatest significance. The old ladies have a perfectly gorgeous time
watching new arrivals and deciding whether certain combinations
really do mean engagements.

I didn’t plan to go, myself, because (1) I hadn’t a girl, and (2)
I wasn’t sure I’d be back from my canoe trip on the Stone River.
However, I did get back the day of the* ball, and I ran into June on
the library steps—she was working in the library—about five o’clock.

“So this is the big day,” I said.

“Yes,” said June.

"Me, I’m not going.” I announced.

"Neither am I,” said June.

I stared at her, and before I got my balance blurted out, “Why,
what’s become of Dan Shorely?”

“Oh, Dan’s all right.”

“You and Dan been scrapping?” I blurted again.

“No.” She hesitated, then spoke frankly as she always had:
“You’re surprised I’m not going to the club with Dan, aren’t you,
Art? I’m a little surprised, myself. You see, I didn’t know Beatrix
was getting back from Europe. But of course—”

She didn’t need to finish. The Colars are the real class of Jason
City, and Beatrix and Dan always had paired off. Dan had just been
playing around with June till Beatrix got back. Of course!

“The piker!” I exclaimed.

“Not at all.”

But I was pretty mad. “S-a-y,” I cried, “you know you were plan-
ning to go to this fool ball, and you know you’ve got your clothes
all ready, and Dan Shorely’s several kinds of a snob—and you’re
going to that ball with me.”

June stood back and looked at me, and I’d have sworn her eye-
lashes were wet, if the next minute she hadn’t given a little laugh.

“I am, Art,” she said.

And she did.

IWAS pretty proud, marching June Addis into that country club,
seeing that she had some good dances, and in general teaching
Jason City that social distinctions were silly, and that a univer-
sity man hasn’t any time for ’em.

June seemed to enjoy herself a lot. I’d never seen her so gay
before. She danced like a nymph, and held her head back and
laughed at the right places, and at our little supper table, on the
veranda, with the candles wavering in the faint summer breeze, she
acted as if she’d been used to that sort of thing all her life. Ohly,
we all knew that she’d probably never eaten by candle-light before.
And she looked like—well, like a million dollars.

Then the whole thing was all over. We were going down the steps
to our car. Somehow, Beatrix Colar and Dan Shorely fell in beside
us.

“Hasn’t it been lovely?” exclaimed Beatrix, who is a very nice
girl. “I don’t know when I’ve enjoyed a dance so much.”

“Been as good as one of our interclass hops,” remarked Dan, who
hasn’t his father’s banker’s tact.

“I hope,” I said all at once, “that June likes our hops as well.
She’s going up to the University with me for one, sometime, and
I’m just afraid the men will cut in so much I won’t even know she’s
there.”

“You’ll love that,” said Beatrix sweetly to June.

“Oh, if I’m able to go. I’m not sure yet,” said June, who was
hearing about it (as indeed I was myself!) for the first time right
there.

I thought both girls were pretty clever about it.

It’s a short spin out to the Addis cottage, in a car. We were there
almost at once, it seemed, standing at the gate, and June saying what
a lovely time she’d had.

Then, impulsively, she put a hand on my arm, lightly—not in a
petting way at all—and said:

“I can’t ever thank you, Art.”

And she was gone, running up the walk.

I drove back along the town streets, slowly. It didn’t seem such a
bad town, nor such a bad world, just then. I drew up beside the
park. I could hear the fountain bubbling. I lighted a cigarette, and
inhaled thoughtfully. I felt satisfied. I think that’s the word. I
was glad June had had her ball, after all, and her good time.

Then, suddenly, I sat up straight in my seat. I seemed to know
something abruptly that I hadn’t guessed before. June hadn't had
a (jood time. The distinctions were there just the same. All the
time she was dancing with me she’d been thinking how she had
planned to be dancing there with Dan. At least, that’s what I
thought as I sat up in the car, there beside the park, with the funny
old fountain bubbling away in the dark.

After all, nothing happens in Jason City, Illinois. Not even when
you think something’s happening. It’s my home town, and I know. . . .

THAT was Arthur Crew’s theme. I put it down on the table,
with the other themes, the blue pencils, and the editor’s letter.
I got up and went to the window. I looked out at the dim cam-
pus, at forms drifting across it here and there, light blurs and dark
blurs in the indistinctness .®. . wandering couples from the
Spring Hop. Two of the wanderers came to the bench beneath my
window. I looked more closely. Then I hurried out of the room,
smiling, and down the stairs, and up to the bench. Smiling. After
all, perhaps I could give that editor—

“Oh, hello, F. II.!” Arthur Crews called out, standing up.

I advanced, smiling.

“I want you to meet one of our Jason City girls,” said young Ar-
thur Crews. “Beatrix, you’ve heard me speak of. . . .”

I went back to my room, to the blue pencils and the themes. But
first I tucked the editor’s letter into a drawer. His young-love story
would have to wait. For these fleeting first-kiss affairs are like Jason
City, Illinois. Nothing really happens. Not even the kiss, some-
times. And the trouble with stories is that something has to hap-
pen in them. . . .	Copyright: The Crowell Publishing Company: 1925

A THOUGHT OR TWO FOR THE FRATERNITIES

By JEROME

G. KERWIN

HE COLLEGE FRATERNITY has grown to be a great force
for good or ill on the modern college campus. This fact is
attested by the virulence of the attack upon the fraternity
system from some quarters and the ardor of the defense of the
system from other quarters. The truth of the matter is that most
fraternity groups are neither so evil as painted by their foes nor
quite as beneficial as painted by their friends. They are human
institutions subject to all human frailties, fluctuating in quality
from year to year, and differing in degree and kind in value from
place to place. It is not that I would charge the fraternities with
being without the power to do much good for their members. Most
fraternity groups might at least be conceded a passable moral stand-

men, for their own self-respect and that of their neophytes, to ask
themselves what measure of brotherly love they are gaining by
nightly paddling, by sending men out to gather in stationery and
silverware from the hotels, by compelling men to walk from Gary
to Chicago, by denying men the use of water for cleansing purposes?
Your typical good brother will cite a hundred archaic reasons for
the above practices which deep in his heart he knows constitute
pretty poor argument. I know of no better method of undermining
all that the term fraternity implies than the rough-house induction.
There will be joy in heaven and on earth when some day a spirited
freshman delegation rebels. Is there no group courageous enough,
are there no men big enough on campus to start an honest

ard. That is not the main difficulty.

The difficulty, it seems to me, here and
elsewhere, is that fraternities are too often
the conservators of worn-out traditions,
promoters of the rah-rah spirit, and checks
upon independent thought and action. Be-
lieving it to be their mission to encourage
respect and reverence for the customs of
the college, the fraternities become forces
for reaction regarding the new idea with as
much suspicion as the post-war super-
patriots. It is, indeed, among the unfortu-
nate tendencies of the day that fraternities
are so seldom found in the forefront of those
movements which promote a greater in-
tellectual and cultural life among students.

of our annual orgy, otherwise properly called “Hell Week,

Jerome G. Kerwin of the Political
Science department eats in many fra-
ternity houses often enough to he
calk'd “Jerry." He is himself a fra-
ternity man from Dartmouth, and pro-
poses their system of second year
pledging to correct many of the de-
fects of Greek letter societies here.

towards its abandonment?

Despite all disadvantages urged
sophomore pledging, there are
definite advantages which seem to

inquiry
looking

gainst
certain
me un-

which advance interest

deniable. First of all, the freshman will
have time and opportunity to view the whole
fraternity situation calmly and judiciously.
He will have time to determine a preference
if he has any. Secondly, the fraternity will
have a better chance of judging the fresh-
man. Thirdly, the freshman will have an
opportunity to form natural friendships
among his classmates, friendships which
may grow for a whole year without the dis-

in public affairs, which curb the undue influence of commercialized
athletics, or which look towards the extinction of that most noise-
some practice of introducing fraternity politics into every field of
campus competition. The failure of fraternities to enforce such
causes leaves them nothing more than cavalier, class-conscious social
clubs in the estimation of forward-looking students and college folk
throughout the land.

This brings me to a consideration of two causes on our own
campus which fraternities might well promote; first, the abolition
of slap-stick initiations, secondly, the adoption of the sophomore
pledging system. In the dark ages of college life we used to practice
all kinds of inhumanities upon the freshmen. Breaking raw eggs
in the freshman’s hair, tying him to the railroad tracks, nailing
him in a barrel, making him do a hundred absurd tricks for the
delectation of upper-classmen—these things and other forms of
hazing have now been relegated to the movies, to the high school
“frats,” and, alas, to the college fraternities.

turbing influence of fraternity allegiance. Fourthly, the freshman
may apply himself to the important work of laying a firm scholastic
foundation without the interference of extraneous interests. To the
last point the fraternities may answer that they assist the new
student in his work, show him how to apply himself, and in the long
run give him a fair start in his college courses. I only speak from
experience when 1 say that 1 have not as yet found this contention
to be true.

HE COLLEGE WORLD in general has matured. The frater-
nity world remains the harbinger of many of the puerile notions
and practices of other days. Is it not time for mature college

THERE MAY be a long, lean year while a sophomore pledging
system is being put into effect; the results in the long run would
justify the sacrifice. Some modus vivcndi could be arrived at
to provide for such a period; elsewhere it has been done.

The fraternities contain most of the leaders of campus life. They
have potential resources for leading worthwhile movements. The
supporters of fraternities claim great things for them; there are
reasons for believing that such claims may be carried out, there are
equally as many and good reasons for believing that they are not
being carried out. In this age when all existing institutions must
justify before a critical public their right to be, the fraternities
here and everywhere must demonstrate their usefulness in a rapidly
changing and progressive student world.

MOVIE STARS FROM U. OF C.

By GENEVIEVE HARRIS
(Motion Picture Critic, The Chicago Evening Post)

JUST WHAT connection there is between
a course in philosophy and a career in
the films has never been investigated.
But undoubtedly there is one. At least two
former students of the University of Chi-
cago may be cited as examples. Two of the
brightest of the screen’s stars were shining
lights in philosophy out at the U. of C.
They are Milton Sills, who liked the subject
so well that he became an instructor for a
while, and Sessue Hayakawa, the Japanese
star, who has written a book of compara-
tive philosophies, on days when he wasn’t
in demand at the studios.

That scholarly attainments and the dra-
matic urge may exist side by side is shown
by the careers of these two men. It is espe-
cially notable in the case of the Japanese
star, who has won a place not only in the

Altho Miss Genesieve Harris, motion
picture critic for The Chicago Evening
Post, modestly avers she prefers golf to
baseball, she is known as the champion
“pinch hitter” of the staff. If good or
bad fortune suddenly calls one of her
colleagues away from her desk, Miss
Harris can always be relied upon to
meet the emergency. In her spare mo-
ments she writes short stories and does
magazine feature articles. Occasion-
ally, for diversion, she saunters off to
Europe and takes courses at the Sor-
bonne.

in the history of human ideas! A varied
range of interests is his.

HE recalled old days at Chicago. He
had come a long way from his home
in Japan in pursuit of knowledge and
he was often a homesick boy.

“The language was the worst obstacle.”
he recalled. “I could read it but I couldn't
speak well, and I couldn’t understand what

was said to me.

So I asked people to write

down what they wanted to say!”

Hayakawa has an easy command of Eng-
lish now, and is likewise at home in French.
He has played throughout Europe in a short
stage number, but his motion pictures had
preceded him, and he was already a familiar
figure to his audiences in all the great cities.

film world but also in the spoken drama and in vaudeville. Hayak-
awa walked out of the set on the Palace Theater stage, where he
had “died” dramatically in a playlet based on a story he had writ-
ten, and sat down to chat about his literary ambitions and his studies

“The dramatic urge” is his explanation
for his choice of career. Dramatic talent and a magnetic person-
ality were his with which to win success. But though his profession
calls him to the stage, his temperament still is that of the detached
observer. Hayakawa remains the student of philosophy still.

VALUABLE MINUTES

By MERRILL C. MEIGS

IN ASKING me to write an article for The Daily Maroon, your
managing editor indicated that he had been instructed in the
value of a publisher’s time, for which I am glad. I hope, too,
that all his readers have been similarly
impresseed so that a golden glamour will
accompany my words and make them seem
more than they really are.

As a matter of fact, a publisher is busy—
busier than a three-headed cat in a cream-
His frightful preoccupation with a
thousand things makes him peculiarly sus-
ceptible to suggestions for saving time. A
friend of mine dropped in the other day
and said he had an original idea for saving
vast quantities of time every day, and any
person could use it. Naturally I was eager
for details.

It seems that everything the average per-
son says during his life-time has been said
so many millions of times before that there’s
absolutely no use in finishing sentences at
all. Subject, predicate, modifiers and all the
rhetoric we learned in school are so much
soapsuds on the French pastry. If you
start a sentence, or hit the high spot, and
then say, “and so forth,” any normal
person will understand.

“Babe” Meigs, whose signature is
Merrill C. Meigs, won his reputation as
an athlete when he played on the Ma-
roon eleven that defeated Michigan, 2-0,
for the conference championship in
1905. He won his letter in both base-
ball and football, and worked his way
through school. At the end of his col-
lege career he tried his hand at selling
advertising for the Chicago Evening
American, and until a year ago was try-
ing his hand as advertising manager of
that paper. Then William Randolph
Hearst made him publisher of the Chi-
cago Herald and Examiner. Mr. Meigs
has been active in alumni circles since
his graduation, and returns yearly to
address the football team before big
games.

FOR INSTANCE, why waste valuable minutes in pointless talk
about the weather when suddenly exposed to strangers? Why
not just say: “Underfoot etc. hard winter etc. California etc.
golf alas etc.”? (Two seconds by the
clock.)

Or if it is summer time, “Humidity etc.”
will do nicely, and take only seven-sixteenths
of a second.

By the same token, when required to carry
coals of wisdom to the Newcastle of the
University of Chicago, why shouldn’t I
address you as follows:

“Bright young faces etc. university train-
ing etc. great questions before the American
people etc. age in which we live etc. com-
plexity of modern life etc. view with alarm
etc. mental, moral, spiritual etc. younger
generation etc. reminds me of a story etc.
twenty years etc. marvels of science etc.
lower classes etc. before the war etc. mil-
lennium etc.” (eight and one-half seconds by
the clock.)

And I won’t have to utter a single, “If
you know what I mean,” because I am mor-
tally certain you do.

A MODEST PROPOSAL

For Simplifying the Telephone Book and Helping Impatient Teamsters

By ALLEN HEALD, ’26

iTISS McFOO,” said my friend, “I should like to present
1 Mr Hogaboom.”

A Both of us nodded.

“What odd names people have.” said Miss McFoo.

I agreed. “Perhaps you would be interested,” I said, “in a little
scheme of mine, for solving just that problem.”

The truth is, that this very question, this matter of odd names,
had bothered me considerably of late, and I had resolved to work
out a remedy. I had not mentioned this to any of my friends,
because few of them take an interest in a plan of this kind (“specu-
lation.” they call it) ; some, in fact, laugh at it. But clearly this
young woman had ideas on the same subject. She would lend an
understanding ear.
*	*	*

Most people (I began, when we had found a quiet corner) are
named without even the shadow of logic. A child is born; his
parents name him Edgar. Is there any clear-cut reason why he
should go through life as Edgar, and not Hungerford? True, Edgar
may have been his uncle’s name; but because the name fit his uncle,
can we say that it will fit him? And what logic lay behind his uncle’s
being named Edgar, in the first place? Thousands of children,
doubtless, are named Edgar every year, for no other reason than that
some uncle (or perhaps some grandfather) was himself named Edgar.
We. with our rich harvest of modern science, with our heritage of a
century of discovery, must call upon our uncles and grandfathers
for so simple a thing as a name.

What does this name Edgar mean, anyhow? The dictionary, of
course, will say in its appendix on Christian Names and Their Mean-
ings, “EDGAR (Anglo-Sax.), heart of steel,” or perhaps “EDGAR
(Austral.), the shining one.” But how many of the parents who
bestow the name so freely, know this? And what would be one’s
chances of guessing it, from a glance at those of one’s friends who
are named Edgar?

Miss McFoo interrupted here, to say that she thought Edgar a
good, conservative name, and knew several creditable young men
who bore it. I hastened to agree. I had no idea, I explained, of
casting reflection upon the name Edgar, any more than Philbert or
Bowlby. My point was only this: that names, as now used, fail to
justify themselves logically, and confuse us who must remember them.
We must look around us for a way out of the dilemma.

*	*	*

CONSIDER (I said) the way in which scientists name the
different species of animals, or the stars in the heavens. Or,
consider the plan upon which books are catalogued in libraries.

Each star, or animal, or book, has two names: one indicating a
large group to which it belongs; and one its own individual name,
distinguishing it from the other members of the same group. The
advantage of such a plan is this: One glance at the star or book
or animal (if you know anything about the subject) will tell you its
name. The scientist, digging away in some fossil-bearing soil, comes
upon a skeleton. “Ah, Pithicanthropus,” he remarks.

Would it not be a great boon to us, if after one glance at a
stranger, we could name him so readily?

That, I told my new acquaintance, is just what I propose. Let the

human race be divided into a dozen or so of groups, according to
several simple, obvious features—things that we can note at a glance
—and designate each group by a letter. Thus:

Persons parting their hair in the middle, M.
Pigeon-toed persons, P.

Men wearing double-breasted suits, W.

Men of athletic build, C.

The man on the street has taken several steps in this direction
already. What redhead has not been called “Red” by strangers who
will never learn his real (or I should say his “conventional”) name?
Many a teamster, trying to attract the attention of a pedestrian
standing in his way, has shouted, “Hey, you with the funny face.”
Now the difficulty is, that the man so addressed too often pays no
attention. He does not know that he is the man so addressed. Yet
the teamster’s improvised name is much more logical than, say,
Oosterbaan; and it has this great advantage, that the teamster takes
one look at the man, and knows the name. “You-with-the-funny-
face” has only one fault; it is too long. Then let us shorten it.
“Four-hundred-pound man about to sit on mound upon which bee is
already sitting” (the name of a celebrated Indian chief) is translated
into the Cherokee language by a word of one syllable. We can go
the Cherokees one better. We can translate the teamster’s epithet
by a single letter.

Miss McFoo asked what letter I had in mind. I replied that
almost any would serve.

Each of us, then, ought to have as part of his name a letter, which
any stranger could learn at a glance.

* * *

MY FRIENDS, who need something more than a group-letter
to designate me, could call me familiarly by a number, which
would distinguish me from all the others of my group. The
scientist uses this idea, too. When his shovel first hits the buried
skeleton he cries, “Pithicanthropus.” That is the name of the group,
the general family; certain very plain characteristics tell the scientists
at once that the skeleton belongs to that group. Later, he grows
more intimate with the skeleton. He wires it together, hangs it in
his library, and contemplates it. Presently, he knows it by a more
familiar name. “Erectus,” he whispers. That is the skeleton’s own
individual name, by which it is distinguished from slightly different
skeletons of the pithicanthropus group. So a man may be known
to strangers as F, that is, a fellow with gray flannels; his friends,
however, will know him as 226—a number that distinguishes him
from all other wearers of gray flannels. In formal records—legal
papers, telephone books, etc.—the letter and the number would both
be recorded: F-226. Another man would be named W-31; a third,
E-ll. My name, instead of Joe Hogaboom (a particularly absurd
name, I have always thought) might be U-53.

* * *

MISS McFOO expressed considerable interest as she bade me
goodbye.

“Thank you so much for explaining your plan, Mr. Higgin-
bottom,” she said.

I smiled indulgently. “You would not have made that mistake,”
I said, “if my plan were in effect.”

WAY BACK WHEN—AND WHY NOT?

By HARRY

R. SWANSON

WHEN the present editor of The Daily Maroon called upon this
predecessor to contribute an article for the special holiday edi-
tion, and the predecessor, lured by the winning manner of
Mr. Walter G. Williamson, consented, the predecessor did not realize
what he was promising. For it has been almost ten years since he
wrote his swan song, introduced his successor and pushed aside the
battered old typewriter in Ellis Hall to go forth into the world and
join his comrades in the call of war. What can he say that would
interest the current subscribers of The World’s Greatest College
Newspaper? “Ten years.” That answers his problem—for it gives
one the privilege to reminisce—to tell the campus of today some of
the things that happened in years gone by.

In 1913, The Daily Maroon was printed in a little “one-horse”
shop at Fifty-Fifth Street and Cottage Grove Avenue by an amateur
printer who was at one time the manager,
the linotype man. the compositor and the
pressman, and whose frequent errors gave
fertile fields for the immortal Bert Leston
Taylor who ran the column in The Chicago
Tribune over the initials B. L. T. Hardly a
week passed by but what The Line reprinted
some humorous mistake, and on two occa-
sions I remember when we were forced to
throw’ an entire edition into the waste-
basket because of errors that were far too
serious to circulate among the unsophisti-
cated students of those days.

At that time the staff of The Daily Maroon
numbered less than ten, and when one dis-
counted the feeble efforts of the freshmen,
the staff really totalled about three, meaning
that the new’s editor, who was the “goat” of the board, had to be on
the job every night until midnight and frequently until three in the
morning. One of his duties was to carry a sufficient quantity of
safety pins and chewing gum for repairing the linotype machine,
w’hich broke down at least once every night.

IN 1914 the business management proved more profitable, and our
antique print shop was closed by the sheriff, so we transferred
our activities to Sixty-second Street and Cottage Grove Avenue,
w’here the contract remained for many years. As a result of keen
competition for the position of business manager in 1915, so many
advertisements were booked by the competing solicitors that we were
forced during the Spring Quarter to publish eight-page papers twice
a week, most of the matter being commercial. This caused a great
w’ave of excitement among the purists on the campus, who whispered
here and there that The Daily Maroon management had succumbed
to the mercenary interests of life, and that the editors and business

W e don’t know whether Harry was
sarcastic or not when he said that he
was “hired by the winning manner of
the managing editor,” hut we do know
that he was editor of The Daily Ma-
roon during 1916-1917 and also presi-
dent of I’he Daily Maroon Company.
Although, because of his activities as
secretary of the Chicago Alumni Club,
his name has often appeared in this
dailv, this is his first signed article since
1917.

managers were spending all of their time interviewing bond sal
men for the purpose of laying aside their surplus funds. Which \ b
may believe, if you wish.	Ou

In 1916 the writer of this article originated The Campus Whistl
w’hich still persists. The original Whistle was written over th
initials of T. E. H., the meaning of which was never explained untl
the end of the academic year, when it was revealed that these letter
stood for The Editor Himself. On several occasions during that year
the column was turned over to Richard Atwater, who wrote over th
title of Richard XII, and who now conducts the column in The Chi
eago Evening Past known as From Pillar to Post, signing himself
as Riq. The Daily Maroon can, therefore, claim one of the leading
column conductors of America as its own.

THE WOMAN’S EDITOR in 1916 was
Rosalind Keating, who now writes the
weekly article on Hollywood in The Chi-
eago Sunday Tribune under the name of
Rosalind Shaffer. She married George Shaf-
fer, a news editor of The Daily Maroon, who
is the Tribune correspondent in California
and whose name appears almost daily over
news articles from the coast. Martin Stevers
who was a managing editor in 1914, has been
identified prominently with newspapers jn
Chicago for many years, and his successor
George Cottingham, is an editor of a news-
paper in Houston, Texas.

The scandals of those days are the com-
monplace of today. Female knees were dis-
cussed privately by a small group of sophis-
ticated seniors who had ventured into the Englewood, a leading
burlesque house of the south side. Billiard chalk reposed in pockets
now devoted, so I am told, to flasks. Liquor was not known as an
international collegiate problem. At one time it did become a local
problem, when the enterprising business management of The Daily
Maroon broke out one morning with an advertisement of mellow
lager beer, but this matter was quickly disposed of by the faculty,
who were particularly incensed when they learned that the editors
were taking out the cost of the advertising in trade.

Much happened at the recess period from ten-fifteen until ten-
forty-five. “Fussing” by the romantic element was carried on during
that half-hour in front of Cobb, and then Man’s Man Club met in the
basement to discuss new political units and cover up double-crossing
crusades. Chapel seats were not assigned, so attendance was regular
in couples. Yellow Cabs were considered very plebeian, and fresh-
men bringing women to fraternity parties in these shiny yellow
cars were tubbed immediately.

WILD STUDENTS 1 HAVE KNOWN

By ELLSWORTH FARIS

TO THE VISITOR coming in they may all look alike, just as
Westerners are said to be unable to distinguish at first differ-
ences between Chinese faces. But to the veteran adventurer
in academic wilderness the ability is acquired in time to see the trees
in the woods. And “trees” is good, at least some trees are good.
Some of the students are not unlike some
kinds of trees.

One type reminds me always of my old
camping days; we may call him a damp log
of rotten wood. The camper who has tried
to make a fire from such material can sym-
pathize with the teacher whose most heroic
efforts are frustrated in the face of the im-
movable passivity of this not infrequent
type.

There is another far more active; his pro-
totype comes from the barnyard, or at least
the barn. I mean that humble animal with-
out pride of ancestry or hope of posterity,
who is distinguished by long ears and highly
mobile heels. He kicks at everything; he
raises his hand and voice to object to the
statement of the lecturer, and he economizes time by voicing his
objection before the statement is completed. It does no good to
beat him, but he has his uses just as truly as the fleas on a dog.

The third type depends for his analogue upon modern commercial
life. Quantity production has made possible the sixty-five cent alarm
clock, cheap but noisy. Every teacher knows him, for there is one
in every class. Usually the mechanism is in need of adjustment so
that he goes off at the wrong time. Perhaps a benevolent Providence
created him so that the lecturer should not put everybody to sleep.

Nevertheless there is the sleeping beauty. Of course he was out

Professor Faris, professor of sociology
at the I niversity since 1919, has had a
varied career. His adventures began in
1897. when In* went as a missionary to
the Congo. He remained then- for seven
years. After his return to the I nited
States in 1901, he became associate edi-
tor of the Christian Courier, and also
held a teaching position. He left both
of these offices to study at tin* 1 niversity
of Chicago in 1912.

late last night. He fills you with confidence because he shows that
he trusts you to say nothing dangerous. He is in the nature of the
case not an upstanding fellow. The Buildings and Grounds should
in justice furnish pillows. Probably his mother loved him. but if
she is no longer living, he must be very lonesome.

ND THEN in the marts of trade an-
other student type is provided with
its analogue. It was invented in Day-
ton. From the cash register one gets just
the coins that have been previously dropped
in. From the cash register student the exact
phrase reappears. He is usually thoroughly
satisfied with his work, but physiologists do
not regard as normal that reversal of our
deglutition which brings up the food in ex-
actly the condition it was in when swal-
lowed.

Of course there are others, but let me
hasten to mention the shining metal which
is the reward for working with the moun-
tain of dross, for it is the instructor's de-
light. He is a living soul; he is interested when he comes and is
alert and curious in the face of novelty. He reads an opportunity
and actually thinks. Two new thoughts a quarter are worth the
price of admission. He is not a grind but he has an intellect and
uses it. He regards the teacher as a coach drilling him for the
game of life to follow. If there are ten of these in a class of one
hundred, and there are sometimes more, the instructor can satisfy
his soul, and in the strength of this meat he can go many days
until at last he comes to the end of the road.

SUMMER MORNING AT TIMES SQUARE, NEW YORK CITY

By LESLIE RIVER

Leslie River, ’25, one time editor of The Daily Maroon, is noiv an
advertising man residing in New York. He is the author of a novel
now in the hands of Boni and Liveright, publishers, entitled “The
Journal of David Block.” River was co-author with Russell Pierce
and Jack Oppenheim of “Kaiti from Haiti,” the Blackfriars show of
that season.

THE citizens of this city never visit their aquarium, their zoo-
logical gardens, their spots of historic interest, as the young-
est among you know. But once in a while, of a Sunday morn-
ing. small groups of them sneak away from their homes while the
hour is still early, and with little paper flowers on their hats. Alto-
gether they make a rather gigantic group. And they ride for hours
in a dark tunnel until at last they come to the ferryboat, at the
south end of Manhattan. Very happily belched up into sunlight
they clamber aboard the S. S. Mayor Hylan. They are ingeniously
protected from crowding overboard by the foresight of someone,
perhaps Mayor Hylan, who has had spiked bars placed all about the
outer edges of deck.

It is true that some, always, are impaled on these; but to the New
Yorker this is a holiday sight indeed. Poor victims of a frustrated
sadistic temperament that they are! in a subway that can only break
a person’s foot or at best, trample gleefully on some unlucky brother
who has fallen. But alas! they can never see his grimace of pain,
there; while on the ferryboat, with the accordion band making merry
and a festive spirit gleaming in every honest face, they can watch
the last exquisite agony of those impaled ones.

So, after a long pleasant journey they arrive at Staten Island
and they troop like a jubilant crowd of children down to Midland and
South Beaches. There the babies cry more loudly, the waves are
saltier, and the happy throng sits more thickly than at Coney Island.

(Madam, he’s pulling the feather off your hat.)

To the Island natives all this is of no consequence. On Sunday

A woodcut by Edgar Millar to illustrate a recent story by
Dr. Jolin C. Schocnherr, opera composer. The story of which
the above woodcut is an illustration tells of the early days
in Chicago's Greenwich village, of debauches, and artist orgies.
It strikes the same mood that Mr. Millar's woodcut does. It
is almost wholly impressionistic and reflects the abandoned,
renegade spirit that permeates the old school bohemian dis-
trict.

morning the good burghers tilt chairs against the house front and
breathe sleepily amid whiffs of red wine, while the foreign element,
strange people who still talk about the Mayflower and retain other
curious traces of their old country such as going to Manhattan
throughout the week to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, these
people close their doors and windows and steep their prayers in a
thin odor of tea.

(Madam, his nose is running.)

But a third life exists there, that few suspect. The great forest
that runs through the center of the Island from end to end, is the
haunt of a small herd of homo sapiens, once human as you and I,
who once dressed, ate, shaved, lived and loved as we do.

What is more, they once wrote. Perhaps that was the trouble.
Anyway, on a Sunday morning, he who is lucky and has sharp eyes
(like little Johnny down there) can see them peering faunlike
through the trees. Then their small feet go galloping away in fright
over the rocks, and from far off you can hear them laughing and
sporting in the sun.

One day I caught one of them, a bright fellow no bigger than a
water spout. I offered to buy him a coffee. He laughed scorn-
fully:

(AN UNHAPPY STORY)

ONCE I would have pawned my soul for a cup. That, in fact, is
the unhappy story of my life. I settled down in Greenwich
Village when I came to the city but soon discovered that ends
were not meeting. So I moved to this Island, where I lived reasonably
enough for a while on bread stolen from the grover’s porch and milk
from the people’s door steps. This went on for a time, but at last the
grocer had his bread delivered in great steel caskets and the milk
company fitted each bottle with one of those death dealing knives
you read of in stories of old treasure chests. Soon I had not even
the fare to Manhattan. I pawned my typewriter and could no longer
write. I pawned my overcoat, my shirts, my suit, everything until
at last I was forced to flee into the forest where I met others whose
plight was the same, and whose stories are the same, as mine.”

Unfortunately I was thrown into an introspective depression by
his words and let him slip from my fingers. He scampered through
the grass and was off to frisk with his companions, happily under
the trees.

But I have digressed terribly, pardon me, and what I started to
tell you is that Staten Island, as it is commonly called, really is the
Borough of Richmond, population 127,000 and 74 miles square, and
surrounded on all sides by water. As we approach it on the ferry-
boat you will see Governors Island, the Statute of Liberty, and lower
Long Island. Later, when we reach our destination and ride along
Richmond Turnpike, you will see the Ocean on the left and the Don-
gan Hills on your right.

(There he is, madam, the little devil is over yonder watching a
man under the car wheels.)

^ A Man Dies, All the World Dies Within Him'

A Prose Poem

By LESLIE RIVER

THERE is a bouquet of crepe beside the door, the very austere
violet that is used for old people. This means the man within
the house is dead. He died of a stopping heart at four in the
morning.

Now it is late in the afternoon. The sun is coming from a very
great distance, now, through the trees and as it falls softly across
the grass and touches the stairs and the boards of the porch, at
whim, it is a gray and gold substance, and pleasant. It is late in the
afternoon and the dead, by this time, is entirely dead.

First his heart stopped, but curiously, it was his mind that died
first. It was a mind through which the whole world had blown like
a long drifting of white blossoms and dead leaves. And yes,
strangely, it was of blossoms that his memory was made, the soft
clinging things, the pleasant things that his mind had caught as they
drifted by. These are the things he thought of, sitting at his win-
dow, when he was old. In his mind were moonlight fallen on quiet
water and in some far off garden a sky etched black with boughs
and a single star, on a sea the quick drip of sun and ”.ght splashing
up again in air. These w’ere the things in his mind and they died,
when his mind died.

Then his heart died, a dark place, like a hidden gutter clogged with
dead leaves. In his heart were long hatreds, spears that reached
far out to inevitable deaths which hung bathed with blood, curiously
in the figure of humans, the white breasts of women bared, and
taken by force, their heads fallen back blue lipped and shadowed with
torture.

He is dead, now, and these things have all died within him, in his
mind and his heart.

But there is a very blue sky above the early air of evening, and
a taut muscled cat beside the briar hedge is stalking a bird, or an-
other cat.

THE UNIVERSITY IN POLITICS

By ARTHUR R. ROBINSON, T3	1

OLITICS is the science of government, and there can be no
national success without good government. Ours is a gov-
ernment “of, for and by the people,” and every man, woman
and child in the Republic should be vitally interested in the govern-
ment of the country in which we live.

It is surprising therefore, and just a little depressing, that so
few men and women attending our universities should take an active
interest in politics.

While this writer attended the University of Chicago, students
on all sides were devoting their time and energies toward fitting
themselves for life’s work. Some expected to be teachers; others
went in for medicine and law, and there were those also who expected

to become members of the clergy; still others
desired to follow in the paths of physical
science. Many were seeking to fit themselves
for business and commercial life.

Few indeed seemed to care anything about
politics, or had any desire to follow public
careers. The trend continues in this direct-
ion, with business and industrial life seem-
ing to have the greatest attraction for the
greatest number.

This is unquestionably a commercial age,
and business offers great inducements to col-
lege men, but unless the government is on a
high plane and conducted by able and honor- L
able public servants, business cannot prosper.

For after all, we must have a stable government.

Arthur R. Robinson of the class of
June, 1913, is now United States senator
from Indiana. He has practiced law.
sat on the bench, and served in the
A. E. F. and the Indiana legislature.
He was appointed United States Sena- *
tor by Governor Jackson of Indiana to
occupy the seat left vacant by the death
of Hon. Samuel M. Ralston.

UBLIC LIFE is undoubtedly onerous and on entering it, one
must be reconciled to considerable sacrifice. Motives will be
misunderstood—deliberately by some and mistakenly by oth-
ers. Insinuations will be made, conscientious convictions sneered
at, and situations arise that try men’s souls, but finally the truth
will prevail. The people can not long be misled, and in the end,
false prophets and demagogues are without influence.

College men and women are admirably equipped to serve the pub-
lic. In the first place, they have educational advantages and are
generally well prepared to lead in political thought.

Government deals with great economic questions; with interna-

tional problems of the gravest character; with legal matters rUn
ning through its entire structure. Politics in the larger sense enters
the homes of the land, makes and enforces the laws by which wp
must abide, establishes our taxing systems, provides for sanitation
and hygiene, administers the police power and ultimately regulates
our National life.

Surely, here are varied and important fields for genuine service
to mankind, and who is better equipped for these great lines of en.
deavor than the man or woman who has had the benefit of trainin?
in our colleges and universities?

True, other work may be more remunerative, but after all, there
is something worth while in the world besides money, and no ljfe

can be dedicated to any nobler end than the
Public Service.

to refuse to exercise

THE MASTER OF THE CROSS i8 ex.
alted authority on this subject: “in.
asmuch as ye have done it unto one
of the least of these, my brethren. ye have
done it unto me.” He serves God who senes
his fellow' men. and in no line of human en-
deavor can any man or w’oman with high
ideals, better serve mankind than in the field
of politics.

Many well meaning people indignantly de-
clare that they will not become “contami-
nated” with politics, and even go as far as
the citizen’s right of franchise. This is. of

course, a narrow and short-sighted view. Politics is government
and the government is just what the people make it. In this country
each citizen has one vote, the high, the low, the rich, the poor, and
that vote rules the Republic. Every citizen is born a sovereign, and
never subject to any crown or to any monarch. Let him then at
least exercise his birthright and vote when his counsel is sought bv
his country.

Politics and public life offer a wide and interesting field for the
man and woman who has had the great advantages of college train-
ing, and it is the hope of this writer that more and more, the
students of our higher institutions of learning may seek careers in
this direction.

STAGG’S STOCKING

By Howard Mann

Christmas dawned upon the Midway
And the chimes of Mandel Hall
Rang to waken any student
Who had gone to bed at all.

This matutinal excitement

Roused Director A. A. Stagg
And without procrastination
Leaped he from his sleeping bag.

Hied he cautiously yet swiftly
To the fireplace because,
There he had the night preceding
Hung a sock for Santa Claus.

Santa Claus had not forgotten
For unthin the woolen hose
An outstanding fast and heavy
Plunging fullback did repose.

On a card icas written: “Greetings!
Here's a player for next fall;

He's as strong as Hugo Rezdek
Atul as fast as Eckersall.”

“Hip, hurrah!" yelled the director
And he made the welkin ring—
Then he murmured to the athlete:
“Mr. Whoozis, can you sing?”

And the plunging fullback opened
Wide his mouth and then let loose
An outrageous cacophony
Like the squawking of a goose.

“What an awful disappoint me nt,"

The downcast director said;

Casting Whoozis in the fire
Sadly went he back to bed.

Satiety, Hate, and a man.)

(Lust, Love, Satiety, and Hate enter slowly.)

All:

We are instruments of fate;

We can refuse or compensate

The weakest or the strongest soul—
We crown the try or hide the goal.

Lust:

1 am the reason for it all;

I give the start or start the fall.

I'm powerful beyond compare

And all must do the things I dare.

L<*ve:

Among us all, most sought am I,

Though when I’m gained, I often die,
And strong as I am said to be,
I seldom live eternally.

Satiety:

And I’m the harbinger of hate;

I’m bom to bore and satiate;

My life is empty, undesired;

I'm tired myself and make all tired.

Hate:

In me you see the goal attained

By those who've icanted, reached, and gained;

I'm proof that all docs not appear

In honest light—that's why I’m here.

PROPAGANDA AND CITIZENSHIP

By RODNEY L. MOTT

THE BESETTING sin of American universities is propaganda.
Their tradition of freedom demands an open door to all creeds
and philosophies. A well-balanced faculty requires men of all
opinions and viewpoints. The pioneer character of our institutions
and the insistent American urge for “progress” make the institution
for higher learning a particularly fertile soil for doctrinaire or the
philistine. Economic and moral interests well know that the future
leaders of the community are trained in its colleges. Political and
social groups fully realize that a prejudice instilled by the professor
is more likely to be permanent than one casually gleaned from the
daily press. The strategic place of the university in the intellectual
and educational life of the country make it a
golden apple for the propagandist.

No one has counted the number of reform
organizations which have prepared and
pushed courses of study on our universities.
Certainly their number is legion. Every year
there is donated to the library hundreds of
books and thousands of pamphlets from
propaganda agencies. The legislatures of
twenty-eight states have required all stu-
dents in public schools, from the elementary
to the university, to pass examinations on
material which is largely designed to instill
in them a set of prejudices. The courses
which began as War Issues have frequently
been turned into courses in Citizenship,
Americanism, The Constitution, etc. In the majority of cases the
departments of Political Science have been called upon to bear the
brunt of these hundred per cent prejudices.

It would seem obvious that a university must guard itself from
becoming the dispenser of pet notions. Its primary purpose is to
foster the arts and sciences, not to further any particular economic
or religious creed. The moment it departs from its scientific work
and uses its class rooms to spread hobbies and ill-digested ideas, dis-
credit is thrown on its truly scientific work. This does not mean
that we must keep silent regarding startling truths we may dis-

Coming to the University in 1923
from Minnesota, where he was an in-
structor in political science, Rodney L.
Mott has in the short time that he has
been here earned his assistant profes-
sorship. He received his A.B. degree
at Leland Stanford university in 1917,
going to Wisconsin from there in 1918
to become an assistant in political
science.

cover. The object of college instruction is to give the next generation
a glimpse of our increasing knowledge of the world. But there is a
great difference between a scientific truth and a tentative hypothesis;
between skill in a practical art and prejudices about our social order.

EVEN THE MOST controversial problems may be studied scien-
tifically. Physics was once little more than a series of pre-
judices. May we not hope that even our complex social life may
some day yield itself to the investigations of the scientist? The
Political Science Department, for example, has even gone so far as to
attempt a scientific study of Citizenship and the Constitution, the
very subjects which constitute the storm
center of propaganda.

Neither can a university afford to neglect
the arts merely’ because they rest on disputed
theories. We teach sculpture and surgery
regardless of our ideas of aesthetics or evo-
lution. There is a world of difference
between building up a conservative complex
and giving instruction in public speaking or
parliamentary law. We can tell students how
to avoid spoiling their ballots, but we need
not urge them to vote the Republican ticket
straight.

Students at the University of Chicago may
take pride in the efforts which have been
made here to pry into the obscure corners of
our complex world. They may well boast of the great contributions
which the University has made to the arts. In no small degree these
are due to the student body itself. Propaganda we will have with us
always, but the careful scrutiny of an intelligent student body will do
much to render it innocuous. In the last analysis it is the student
who makes a university. If they are gullible, undiscriminating,
and inert, there is little hope for scientific advance. But if they
insist on a fearless presentation of the truth and demand that it
be proved before they accept, the future of the University is as-
sured.

BLIND DATES

By D. W. LOCKARD

<]’ WAS SATURDAY night—a blind date—and 11 o’clock that
1 zero hour when the first fire of meeting has burned down and
you haven’t as yet gotten your second wind. It is then that you
rch around for conversation hoping against hope that you will
‘ d something of common interest that will see you through the

• ning. Consequently there seemed nothing to do but ask the old,
old question “Are you going to school by any chance or are you—.”

Tonight by some queer favor of the gods the question worked. A
eer excited look, almost fanatical, came into the girl’s eyes. “Why
I go to the Kindergarten College. Don’t you love kindergarten work?
\\'hv I Just l°ve children. I’m really crazy about the work. Why

And so it went. My poor innocent question had opened up a
isher. Enthusiasm and love for children poured out. “And you
know we are even opening up a school for children from one to three
rears old. Isn’t that marvelous. There is such a future in the
work don’t you think!’’

Unfortunately I had picked the wrong question. Such enthusiasm
on such a subject was something that I had hardly counted on. Being
somewhat truthful and as it was the zero hour I cared very little for
the effect I might make. Consequently I was forced to admit that
the future and the work of kindergarten colleges interested me not
in the least. In fact I had a great antipathy for kindergartens and
an even greater antipathy for this new development—a school for
children of one to three years old. She was hurt somewhat and her
enthusiasm dampened but being a good sort instead of changing the
subject, becoming indignant or asking to be taken home she asked.
■‘Why?” Cornered I was forced to reply.

*	*	*	*

Kindergartens are as I understand them devised to take the child
away from home one year before he or she customarily enters gram-
mar school.

At kindergarten they teach the child to play games, draw pictures
and to generally mix and get along with other children. Half a day
is spent doing this so that five days a week the child has an oppor-
tunity to get away from his home environment, meet other children,
have a good time and be taught good citizenship, as I believe they
call it. Certainly this is a very nice thing and undoubtedly beneficial

to the child. The main trouble is this. The child is thrust out of
the comparative luxury of the kindergarten after one year and then
enters the squalid poverty of the first grade of a city or country
grammar school. At the kindergarten he has a young girl as a
teacher who as a rule comes from a very good home and is, besides
being cultured and intelligent, passionately fond of children. In
first grade the child is taking a chance. He may get the same type
of instructor as he had before but probability is mostly on the other
side.

* * * *

THE LAXITY of the requirements for a teacher’s certificate and
the poor pay both combine to get a type of instructor that is
neither cultured, intelligent, of a good family nor has any of the
other seemingly necessary requirements of a good teacher capable
of putting the children on the right track of knowledge, which surely
must be the end in view of education.

It seems to me that it is because of this poor beginning and the
fact that it is carried through practically the entire grammar school
career and even in the high schools the child as a rule is not turned
out the object that an education has in view. I do not blame the
child because he hates school, has no desire to learn, and drops out
at the slightest opportunity. It seems to rest with the teachers.
And it is not their fault. They too have received the same type of
education and the opportunities of a grammar school teacher are
such that ambitious men and women will not join the ranks. This
is not the school board’s fault. They have no money. And yet money
is being spent lavishly on the development of kindergartens, merely
one year of the child’s life and with an object nothing more than
the object of first grade should be, except it is started a year earlier.
Does it not seem an absurd waste of money to be continually experi-
menting about, spending money here and there when the funda-
mental parts of education are poverty stricken. Something like a
ditch digger buying a radio or a fur coat when the family hasn’t
got enough to buy a loaf of bread.

The moral of all this is of course that one should never ask your
blind date where she goes to school but stick to the weather and
LeMaire’s Affairs.

TO EMBRYO JOURNALISTS

By LAWRENCE H. SELZ

With experience as associate-editor of The Daily Maroon, Tribune
reporter, and wire editor of the Associated Dress bark of him, Larry
Selz, ’24, gives college seniors who plan to choose news writing u^ a
profession some helpful information. He tells also of his present
experience as supervising editor of the Kent Press Service, ivhere he
has charge of hiring reporters.

OF THE CLASS which will get Ph. B.’s this coming June, about
two hundred have taken courses in the English department
beyond the required sophomore composition. And at least
one hundred and fifty of this group will be planning to enter jour-
nalism.

It might not be unwise, therefore, to discuss the chances of land-
ing a newspaper job, and which fields, if any, will bear fruit.

Before we start, we can eliminate about twenty-five of the am-
bitious, but embryo, journalists. They have the foreign service bug.
They are planning to spend the coming autumn in a Paris sidewalk
cafe discussing coups d'etat with moustached diplomats. When the
young men discover that foreign correspondents are graduates of
some ten years of service on this side, and that the posts are a hard
grind, they will forget journalism and be content to satisfy the liter-
ary urge by writing the occasional advertisement papa’s store prints.

But the other hundred and twenty-five are serious minded young
people, all willing to do their stint at fifteen or twenty dollars a
week for the necessary eight months or year.

All of them will look for jobs here. This June the big Chicago
dailies—Tribune, Herald-Examiner, American, News, Journal and
Post—altogether will hire two or, at most, three inexperienced men
during the month. One of these may be a Chicago graduate.

Fifteen more will be hired, approximately, by the less important
papers—Journal of Commerce, Daily Drovers’ Journal, Racing Form,
Southtown Economist, Women’s Wear, the foreign language press
and the trade papers. These papers have not as many applicants
for jobs, pay better, and are willing to train a man.

The news services, the only other field left, hire nothing but experi-
enced help.

More than a hundred are left from our original group, still seek-
ing a job. This group stands by far the best chance of getting

lucrative work, with a far better chance of learning the business
of news writing in all its complexities, on a small paper.

By small paper I mean any daily with circulation larger than
three thousand and under a hundred thousand. The home town, or

[Page Fifteen]

nearby city, has just the paper on which to get a job. It is not diffi-
cult to find work on the smaller paper, as well-educated, willing ap-
plicants are not numerous.

TO ILLUSTRATE let us examine the possibilities within com-
mutation district of Chicago. The Hammond Lake County
Times, Gary Post Tribune, Aurora Beacon News, Elgin Courier
News, Joliet Herald News, Waukegan Daily News, Waukegan Sun,
and Evanston News Index are only a few. They are excellent papers,
extremely well edited and equal in every way to the Chicago papers,
with which they are in direct competition.

A little farther out the South Bend News Times, South Bend
Tribune, Rockford Republic, Rockford Register-Gazette, Rockford
Morning Star, Bloomington Pantagraph, Bloomington Bulletin,
Peoria Journal Transcript are all in the twenty thousand circulation
class, and are wealthy, intelligent sheets.

In working for them the young man will find far more opportunity
than in the impersonal city room here. And he will learn to cover
a beat, chase down an assignment on the telephone, and rewrite, as
well as the arts of makeup, headwriting and conciliating the busi-
ness office.

As an experienced man, with contacts made through correspond-
ence (stories sent to the large papers from the smaller cities) and
with reputation known, he will find himself much in demand by the
men who turn him down as a college senior.

THIS BLACKFRIAR HOAX

By JOSEPH H. WHITE

THAT AUTUMNAL orgy of intensive training and concentrated
effort, the football season, is over. The corresponding vernal
outburst, Blackfriars, is in the offing. And to one who has
seen a good many of these productions the prospect is “just another
Friars’ show.” Blackfriars, next to football, gets more effort, energy,
thought, money, and personal support than any other activity on
campus. But in spite of all this, it seems to become more lavish and
less original each year. Friars’ shows have developed a type. It
seems to be the prevalent idea among the nimble-witted youths who
annually attempt to turn out the winning book that there is a set
formula to be followed.

And as ideas become scarcer, this formula degenerates into little

more than a revue, a loosely bound collection of individual acts,
year’s show is a striking example of that.

New departures, original approaches, are strongly discount!
the weight of this tradition. The aspiring author who nun
some good and rare ideas for a different type of show either
gets them on paper or decides his only chance for success is 1
stereotyped path. Or should the script contain variations thal
der too far from the usual and oft-repeated refrain they are
out in rehearsal.

Hamilton Coleman, in whose hands the fate of Friars’ produ
has rested these many moons, develops a well trained, well cc
cast from raw and inexperienced material. Mechanically the
are good productions. The trouble may be that the clever f
around campus aren’t clever enough; that Friars by its very i
isn’t elastic enough to be the vehicle for more than one type of
that Coleman has a definite idea as to what constitutes a good F
show, that he feels he is approximating that ideal now am
change would only be for the worse; or finally, that everybody
cerned has gotten into a deep rut and finds the well-worn rot
easiest one to travel.

WHATEVER may be the cause, the fact remains that ]
friars have a golden opportunity each year to put over
thing new and grand, and each year the result is only
thing big. The men out for the show put in nearly all their tii
the work; the box-office receipts insure a large working ca
Friars have everything, but—

Why can’t a show be put on that is true to the real colleg
around us instead of to the sort of thing that “Joe College” tyj
Why can’t we get a production that gives us a real laugh at
selves? The first act of last year’s show had possibilities ii
direction; they soon went a-glimmering. Why can’t we have
real characters on the stage, college or otherwise, instead o
feeble conventional caricatures that wander up and down the b
at Mandel? Why can’t we have an organized, definitely foi
moving performance, a unity, instead of a collection of specialti

These are the questions that are asked contemplating the
old Friars’ show that can’t be far behind when winter conus.

The Mystery of Book Design

By ROBERT 0. BALLOU

•w^RUCE ROGERS, William Morris, Bodoni, Stanley Morison—
These are names which are on the tongues of collectors of fine
books, spoken with a little awe as one speaks of a necromancer,
f someone engaged in a mysterious process of magic. But the mystery
of their art, or more properly their craft, for it is scarcely an art, is
soap bubble mystery. Put your finger into it and it is broken.

Conceiving books, in the physical sense, designing books, making
ooks,—these things are as unmysterious and practical as the processes
Connected with making a house, or an automobile. All of this talk
about types, about spacing in composition, leading, margins, and
tricks of design in binding, is meaningless unless it is directed toward
making an article of use in a way that will make it most useful.

Types are designed to this end, rather than with an abstractly
esthetic ideal in mind.

A page of type is well composed when the white space and the
black of the type are evenly distributed over the surface of the
printed paper so that the eye (in this case a path for the thought of
the author) will engage the whole pleasantly and with little effort,
unconscious of any distracting element—often unconscious of read-
ing at all.

MARGINS are well planned when they form an easy and pleasant
frame for the page of type, and an actual “handle” for the
book—a place where the hand may rest in holding the volume
without covering any of the print or distracting the eye.

Binding is good binding when it holds the books together firmly,
harmonizes with the spirit of the text so that it is not a distracting
element, and save the pages from wear.

Here is the soul and substance of book design. For a book, like
any other article of use, is best designed when it best fits its purpose
of practical use.

Christmas

Message

Holidays and vacations are
most appreciated and most
enjoyed when they follow
periods of work enthusias-
tically, faithfully and success-
fully performed. My wish is
that we may all thoroughly
enjoy the coming vacation
and all the holidays of the
new’ year.

To the Campus:

Christmas at the University brings a break in the year's
work and a time of relaxation. May our holiday be a joy-
ful one with more than an indefinite thought of the hap-
piness of others.

During the autumn we all have had our turn at making
this a better year for ourselves and for others. The stu-
dents and faculty have given the Settlement their usual
help, and the groups of the Elementary School have piled
up their presents again for the other fellow’s Christmas.

Christmas is the spiritual beginning of a new year. Let
us remember the good things that come into our life on
the Quadrangles through mutual endeavor, and look next
year to an even stronger spirit of friendliness, and of fruit-
ful participation in hard work, which brings real and last-
ing happiness.

A merry Christmas and a good New’ Year to you all.

Christmas

Message

May Christmas bring to
you a PEACE that is not the
negation of war, but is a con-
fident oneness of spirit in the
common war against ignor-
ance, injustice, and every
other social wrong, and a
GOOD WILL TOWARD
MEN that is not a passive
willingness, but is a resolute
and energetic loyalty.

A Premium Ham, for instance! Any
friend who delights in good things to
eat would appreciate one for a Christmas
gift. Premium Ham is so tender, so ex-
ceptionally sweet and mild in flavor. It’s
a traditional dish for holiday feasting!

Order one of these fine hams from your
