WHAT of IT?

ygO^E MOggNSTIIgg

The University of Illinois band is
extremely irritated. A rash has broken
out on the bass drum, and the saxo-
phones lie awake nights moaning and
sobbing to themselves. There is no
rest for the cellos. It all has come
from the announcement by* the Uni-
versity of Chicago that the whole Il-
linois band can’t be accomodated at
the Battle of Stagg Field this Satur-

SHORELAND HOST TO GREEKS

Twenty Teams Open Drive for Kiddies

day.

Only one hundred bandsmen

will be allowed inside the park. So,
you see, some of the instruments—
two-thirds of them, in fact—in the
three-hundred piece Illinois band will
be forced to pass a dreary week-end
in Champaign, instead of tooting
themselves to a time at the Battle.
This, naturally enough, has subjected
the instruments to a great deal of wor-
ry, trying to guess whether they will
be among the lucky ones to make the
trip to the big city. Hence the irrita-
tion, the rash, the moaning and groan-
ing and crying aloud of the Illinois
band.

The situation, indeed, has been con-
sidered so acute in the Twin Cities
that various individuals in unofficial
capacities have been spending a good
deal of their time lately prophesying
a break in athletic relations between

the universities of Illinois and
cago. Somehow, I cannot take
a possibility with any degree of
ous. I cannot help feeling that.

Chi-
such
seri-
even

were fifteen bassoons and eight French
horns to be left home in Champaign
Saturday, the world fifty years from
now would be little affected by that
fact. Not that I do not appreciate the
Illinois band. It is, in my mind, as in
the minds of about everyone else, a
noble institution. It is bands like that
of Illinois (and Ohio and Michigan,
too) that make those dreary twenty-
five minutes just before the battle be-
gins worth enduring. Maybe the Illi-
nois band won't be able to spell out
“I L L I N O I S” and “CHIC A-
G O” and “H O M E C O M I N G,
H O W D Y” Saturday, because Chi-
cago. won’t leave enough of its play-
ers inside the fence to do so. Maybe
I say, the band won't be able to. It’s
deplorable, no doubt, but what, after
all ,is the odds?

Twenty leaders from the sopho-
more class have been chosen to cap-
tain the teams that will bring in ap-
proximately half of the proceeds of
the Settlement drive.

These teams of ten persons each,
led by the captains, will solicit funds
,from all who are not approached in
the regular subscription drive of the
Settlement. Those chosen are: Flor-
ence Bloom, Ethel Brignall, Jean
Brittain, Florence Herzman, Ruth
Holmes, Violet Holmes, Helen Lam-
born, Dorothy Sylvester, Alice Wiles,
Herberta Van Pelt, Maturin Bay,
Dan Costigan, Don Dodd, Virgil Gist,
Fred Hack, Harry Hagey, John Jack-
son, George Mueller, Burton McRoy,
and Ed Woolf.

All team captains are required to
meet in Cobb 206 this afternoon

Football pays its way for George
“Peanut” Reed, at least. Diminu-
tive George played his first game
against Ohio last Saturday. On his
first two plays, he gained twenty-
five yards. Monday after the game
he appeared on campus with a new
fur coat. George’s father seems to
be a rather liberal man.

My column of Tuesday, having to
do with the increased backing given
the Maroon football team by the boys
who occupy seats in the stands and
used, in the old days when Mr. Stagg’s
men were winning regularly, to be
hostile, but are now friendly, the team
having become the regular underdog,
has elicited the following comeback
from “Faithful Reader,” of Canton,
Ill.: “Yesterday you wrote of a change
in attitude towards the team on the
part of its followers—from hostility to
something like affection. You wrote
that the spectators roar for the boys
for hours on end Saturday afternoons,
and defend the boys from malignant
slander through the rest of the week.
This may be so, but it is not in my
experience.

Football, as women understand it,
will be discussed at the Women
Speaker’s club meeting tonight at 7
in Ida Noyes hall. Each member of
the club will be given a chance to
express ideas about football and pep
meetings in extemporaneous talks on
“The Homecoming Game.”

“What She Saw at the Game,” a
football reading, will be given by
Sophia Malenski, secretary of the
club. Before the close of the meet-
ing Dorothea Hammann, treasurer,
will lead the women in tuotball
cheers and songs.

Ruth Holmes, Maripn Fitzpatrick,
and Mary Louise Hunnell. In the

beth Loomis, Dorothy Sylvester,
Clare Delehant, Dorothy Lowe, and
Marion Garber. The pantomine of
1913 will be pictured by Elva Brown,
Clare Delehant, Eloise Kresse and
Dorothy Sylvester. As a finale, the
1926 ballet is composed of Dorothy
Lowe, Jean Brittain, Annette Lotz,
Jeanette Watson, Katherine Merry-
weather and Virginia Wells.

“It has been my observation that
Maroon supporters this season are not
vociferous in their expressions of the
‘do or die’ spirit. Indeed, they have
seemed consistently apathetic to me
of late, now that the Maroons have
begun to lose regularly. They are not
affected by these defeats; no longer
(as in the old days) do little crowds of
excited townsmen, gather on the cor-
ner and talk excitedly when the boys
are trampled in the mud. Followers of
the Maroons do not seem to take their
beatings to heart, as of yore. Rather,
they take them as a matter of course.
They recognize that the Maroons and
the Old Man are in a slump and
that there’s nothing to be done about
it, but wait for better times to come.
And, I think, their attitude is the best
one to take. Don’t you think there’s
something to what I say?”

I do indeed. With which concession,
I wend my weary way home to the
frat house and solid food.

Minnesota educators are to hear
soon two lectures to be given by As-
sistant Professor Wellington D Jones
of the University geography depart-
ment.

The lectures, '“The Economic Geog-
raphy of India” and “Northern Pata-
gonia: Its Present Development and
Future Possibilities,” will be presented
to the geography section of the Min-
nesota State Education Association
convention, Nov. 6 and 7, in the St.
Paul Hotel, St. Paul Minnesota. In ad-
dition all educators who are interested

Deltho pledges will entertain the
pledges.of the women’s clubs of the
University at a supper spread to be
given Sunday from 5:30 to 8:30 in the
north reception room of Ida Noyes
hall. A musicale will follow, consist-
ing of numbers by Evangeline Wil-
liams at the cello, Edwarda Williams
at the violin, and Mary Nixon at the
piano.

The supper will be the fourth af-
fair given this quarter for club pledges.
Chi Rho Sigma will sponsor a tea
dance in honor of all women pledges,

Saturday Evening Post, beware!

On November eleventh, “Block
and lackie,” this month’s issue of
the Phoenix, will invade the enemy’s
ground with a life story of Coach
Amos Alonzo Stagg. But his domin-
ating features portrayed on the cov-
er will captain, not coach, the offen-
sive publication. Foremost among
the ranks, a photograph of Wally
Marks, with a strong intereference
of satirical football stories, will be a
strong factor in putting the maga-
zine across the goal.

fraternity Homecoming decorations.
The Interfraternity council judges
announce that they will make the
rounds of the houses, as soon as the
afternoon work has been completed,
to decide the winner of the shield for
the cleverest display.

The fraternities are particularly
urged to concentrate on their plans
this year as the visitors from Illi-
nois have just celebrated their an-
nual Homecoming by careful decora-
tions of their campus houses. The
Council further advises as a matter
of hospitality the incorporation of
the Illini colors with the Chicago dec-

sphere and submit to the dignity of
the black tuxedo, while the women
they escort take to their bright blues
and yellows and reds and greens.
Silver slippers and patent leather
shoes will glide to the music of two
orchestras. And over all a sprinkling
of confetti and a tangle of streamers
will give the dance its final touch of
color.

dance have been distributed to the

HOMECOMING

TOMORROW 3,000 undergraduate students will prepare to wel-
come more than 1 7,000 alumni to the campus on Saturday. With
this only the second annual Homecoming at the University, we feel
already an appreciation of the spirit of the occasion.

Pep sessions, decorated fraternity houses, snake dances to the
stadium, thousands of returning grads,—these are the symptoms
that the campus displays in verification of the theory that we have
learned the secrets of a successful homecoming.

Saturday the University of Chicago football team plays that of
the University of Illinois. The game is the central feature of the
Homecoming program. We may win that game, in fact we are
going to win that game, if humanly possible, but there is that possi-
bility that we will lose. The scribes pick us to lose.

After the game is over we will know if Homecoming is a suc-
cess here. If we lose and you have a thousand good alibis, or if win
and you can see no other University in the world, if Chicago seems
greater after the game, win or lose, if everybody is happy, win or
lose, if the 1 7,000 alumni can sing “Wave the Flag for Old Chi-
cago,” five minutes after the game is over, win or lose, then Home-
coming at the University of Chicago is a success. Anyway . . . .

Divinity students are not satisfied
with the Divinity chapel services.
This was the unanimous opinion of
the students who attended the mass
meeting held Tuesday evening in
106 Swift hall. The meeting was
called by the student organizations
of the Divinity School and the Chi-
cago Theological Seminary. Mr.
Frank Ward, president of the Stu-
dent Council of the Divinity School
presided over the meeting.

The mass meeting was announced
“for students only.” In keeping with
this announcement, the utmost free-
dom prevailed throughout the meet-
ing. Frank criticisms of present
chapel services were made from the
floor, and lively discussions followed
the raising of each point. Nothing
escaped criticism; nothing was too
sacred to be questioned.

Object To Lectures

One of the chief objections to the
present Divinity Chapel services was
that the chapel period is given over
too much to academic lectures by
members of the faculty, and too lit-
tle to programs of worship and de-
votion. Student participation was
also urged by several of those who
’ offered constructive suggestions.

Self-criticism, also, played an im-
port part in the discussion. Many
seemed to believe that much of the
ineffectiveness of chapel services
comes from the attitude of the stu-
dents themselves toward the services.
It seems that even theological stu-
dents need to be told to be quiet
in a religious service. Better stu-
dent attendance was, also, recom-
mended as an improvement of the
| service.

A committee of three, Mayhew,
Houser, and Miss Fisher was ap-
pointed to present the results of the
meeting to the faculty committee.

OUR HONOR FROSH

ON my way to lunch I invariably pass the circle where an odd hun-
dred freshmen run relays and cavort generally on the green.
What was my surprise, then, when on the usual trek for food I saw
the Green Cap men marching arm in arm and singing Wave the
Flag of Old Chicago” as they formed a marching C.

What a glorious change from the climbing of trees and mimic-
ing of the fair sex. What a commendable and whole-hearted spirit
to succeed the scoffing of yore.

And when at the command “Turn East” the frosh hurriedly
took their caps from their heads and started singing the Alma Mater
I joined them. And somehow the song meant more. And the green
cap was more than a name.

Twenty-Five Men Represent
Crimson Squad; Twenty-
Six For Yale

With the all important “Yale-
Harvard” game three days off the
official division of the Freshman grid
squad into the two teams was an-
nounced last night. Unofficially the
teams have been separated since last
Thursday but because of the shift-
ing of players to balance the Blue
and Crimson squads the line-up was
unsettled till then.

Yale Lineup

“Yale” has twenty-six men wear-
ing of the Blue jerseys. Linemen
and backs are proportionally distri-
buted. The members of the “Big
Blue” team are: Reeves, Daurel, Ho-
gan, Dustin, Cooper, Froberg, Aron-
son, Abbott, Bloom, Burgess, Hali-
han, Morris. Mendenhall Riddle Dub-
sky, Sorderly, Kelly, Priess, Greer,
Eisentsein, Gray, Hoffert, Rutter,
Watrus, Nonet, and Omufrock.

“Harvard’s” ‘crimson horde’ num-
bers twenty-five. The distribution is
the same as that on the ’Yale’ out-
fit. The men who wull play are: Mc-

Hedeen, Seidner, McNair,

Bortonofsky,
Campbell,

Wattengerg, Alger, Meigs, Koesler,
Gesas, Meadows, Heywood, Marshall,
Wakeland, Best, Vinson Eichenber-
ry, Morrison, Malchewski and Grady.

DEFEAT CAMPUS

Emphasizing convenience in re-
gard to interest in sports among
University women, Miss Marjorie
Camp, instructor in the physical ed-
ucation department, asserted that
an indifferent attitude toward athlet-
ics is not entirely the fault of the
women

“Crowded classes and the unfortu-
nate arrangement of academic and
physical education programs are
bound to detract somewhat from
one’s enjoyment of a sport,” said
Miss Camp “In a University such as
this, where most of the students live
off campus, convenience is a decided
factor. Women dislike to stay over
to add an hour of physical education
to their already crowded curricula.”

“Unfortunately, too, there have
been lapses in the athletic lives of
many of the women, since some aca-
demic institutions do not require
consistent work in physical educa-
tion As a result, many of the
sports have never been played by
University women. They have for-
gotten how to play.

Miss Camp taught at Goucher in
1922-23 and at Columbia in 1924-26.
In regard to the relative proficiency
of East and West in various sports,
she stated that although the Eastern
schools were better in hockey, swim-
ming was about the same in both
sections of the country. Tarpon club
she considers an important asset in
the furtherance of interest in swim-
ming here at the University, and
commends the work of W. A. A. in
fostering hikes and riding classes.

The schedule of the Club League
advanced one stage further yester-
day afternoon when the Burtons and
Macs won over the Campus Terrors
and the Romans. This leaves the Car-
dinals as the only team who have
not yet suffered a defeat.

Burtons 18; Terrors 0

The Burtons tamed the Campus
Terrors to the tune of 18 to 0. Wil-
liam Oplatka was the star of the
game making runs that averaged
about thirty to forty yards. He had
the dash and shiftiness of a Grange
and it is rumored that he should be
out for Varsity instead of Intramur-
als. Another big feature of the game
was the beautiful passes of Rosen-

“Early season basketball practice
looks very encouraging for the Ma-
roon cage hopes this year,” accord-
ing to Capt. Hank Sackett. “There
are no outstanding players in the
pre-season drills,” says the 1926
leader, “but the whole team play has
been outstanding.” The work of his
men in yesterday’s session, featured
by an uncanny number of perfect
scoring plays, substantiated his
statement.

Sackett, Zimmerman, Macklind
and Farwell of last year’s squad and
Gist, Kaplan, Cooper, Forkel, and
Murphy of last year’s frosh have
been practicing hard ever since the
opening week of school. Marks,
Hoerger, and McDonough will be
valuable additions to the squad at
the close of football, as will be Mc-
Connell, baseball capt.-elect, who has
not turned out yet. “Woo” Laverty,
star of the Frosh squad of two years
ago, has hurdled scholastic difficul-
ties, and is making a strong bid at
the guard position.

According to Sackett, this is the
first year for some time that Chicago
has got down to real practice ses-
sions at so early a date.

Maroons, Finally Free From Injury, Drill On Offense in Last
Hard Practice; Downstaters Not
Overconfident

By Victor Roterus

The Illinois football squad with
crafty old Bob Zuppke at their head
will pull in tonight, and probably
bunk at the Cooper-Carlton hotel.
They will adjust themselves to the
rejuvenated Stagg field tomorrow
when they will go through a light
drill.

Illini Recall Past

Although Illinois has all kinds of
reasons for being confident of a
victory over the Maroons, Zuppke
is not having a hard time to con-
vincing his team that they will be in
a battle Saturday; for the invaders
are remindful of past instances
where the Maroons, doped to go
down to certain defeat, did some-
thing else.

Except for Capt. Kassel and
D’Ambrosio, crack ends, the Illinois

team is fit physically. Kassel, an all-
conference wing man well known to
Stagg field patrons, will play only
if Zuppke thinks he is needed to win
the game. Nickol and Wilson have
been playing at the end positions all
week and they will probably start.

The Maroons spent their last hard
scrimmage of the week last night on
offensive drill. The second string
varsity men ran through the plays
against a lineup of freshmen and

LaFayette, Ind., Nov. 3-—Handi-
capped by rain and cold weather, the
Purdue football squad, unbeaten in
the Big Ten will hold its last hard
workout of the week here today in
preparation for the all-important
game with Northwestern at Evans-
ton next Saturday afternoon, which
will decide whether the Purple or the
Old Gold and Black will continue the
race with the conference leaders for
championship honors. A light drill
will be given tomorrow night, and
Friday morning the Boilermaker's
will entrain for Chicago.

The game is Northwestern’s Home-
coming, a situation that should make
the strong Purple rise to new heights
before its alumni.

Iowa City, la., Nov. 3.—Cool plan-
ning of strategic methods by the
coaching staff and warm execution
of those tactics by the players mark
the final practices of Iowa’s football
team preparing to beat off Minneso-
ta’s invaders Saturday.

All the frills will embroider the
edges of the Homecoming pattern
but the main design is this twentieth
game between Hawkeyes and Go-
phers. The old rivalry will be con-
tinued by an Iowa team eager to
condone defeats by Illinois and Ohio
State and a Minnesota eleven just
beginning to ascend to the zenith
of its power.

Minnesota’s giant line is just as
heavy as Iowa’s and a trifle more
experienced.

REASSURANCE

Dear, do not fear just because you
may kiss me

I shall ensnare you with possessive
strings.

Claim all your life, all your soul, and
your future.

I live for pleasure that each moment
brings—

I shan’t pursue you with meaning-
less questions,

Whence you have come, or how long
you will stay.

I do not care whom you may love
tomorrow,

All that I want is your love for to-
day.

“Women Should Have Three Di-
mensions”—Lorado Taft in the Dai-

broadmindedness!

THE winds wax colder. Soon there
will be ice-skating and hockey on the
Midway—and we will all have an-
other sport in which we don’t in-
dulge !

IT’S BETTER

TO HAVE LOVED AND LOST;

THAN TO HAVE NEVER
STUDIED IN HARPER AT ALL! !

AFTERMATH

Softly as heard on pipes of reed
I hear the voicing of your need ....
I hear the words you will not form,
And in your heart I know the storm
That rages ’twixt desire and. creed.

Great is the love I have for you,
And were I to that love less true,
I should give way to keen desire,
And we might know the chastening
fire,

That on the morrow we would rue.
—Virginia

IT’S an awful feeling, isn’t it, to
be pounding along down the boule-

vard when the one whom you’ve got
posted in the backseat to “keep an
eye peeled for trouble” suddenly
gasps, “Ooh, here comes a motorcy-
cle?” And it’s with a peculiar effort
to remember fellows whom you know
with a political drag, isn’t it, that
you put on the brakes and sit up in
your seat with an innocent air? And
it’s almost with disappointment, isn’t
it, that you watch some civilian egg
on an unofficial machine chug by?
That’s what is continually happening
to us. We wish those boulevard par-
asites would be forced to send out
advance radio messages as they pro-
ceed—“Don’t Worry, Boys, It’s Only
Little Me”; or “Keep That Arm
There, I’m Out For Pleasure My-
self,” or "Don’t Alibi, I Thought You
were the Flivver Squad.”

IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE

The wettest guy I’ve ever known,
I never knew such saps were grown,
Dance, he don’t; and sheik, he ain’t,
Drink, he can’t; his line is quaint.

I loathe his Ford, his face I hate—
I’d never give that mess a date! !

You say he’s pledged to Gamma U?
Now there’s a man, I always knew . .

NOW, folks, isn’t the above just
AWFUL? How can we have respect
for FRATERNITIES if the men
CARRY ON in such a REPREHEN-
SIBLE manner? And those POOR
girls—oh, oh, oh, what would the
DEAN say? And how BAD that
nice door man at the COCOANUT
Grove will feel.
