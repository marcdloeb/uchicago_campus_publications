ing of the Board of Supervisors on
Thursday, Robert Carr has been

and Giffoffrd Hitz was named as busi-
ness manager of the 1926 show.

Carr was selected as a successor to
George Bates, who is not in residence

result of three year’s work upon the
part of Carr, as he was in the chorus
during his freshman year, and was on
the Score committee the following two
years. He is also president of the
Interfraternity council and a member
of Delta Kappa Epsilon.

Elect Hitz

The board appointed Hitz to fill the
place of George Wiemer, who left.
school last quarter. Hitz was in the
chorus for the 1924 production, and,
was assistant Score manager last year, ■
He is on the editorial board of the
Cap and Gown, member of the Under-
graduate council, editor of the “C”
handbook last year, editor of the pro-
gram for the present Tnterscholastic
Basketball tournament, and a member
of Iron Mask and Alpha Sigma Phi.
As business manager. Hitz will be in
competition with Philip Watrous, pro-
duction manager, for the position of
Abbot for next year.

Tryouts for the cast will take place
on Tuesday evening at 7:30 in the
Reynolds club theater. Chorus try-
outs will be held on Thursday after-
noon, April 8. at 3:00 in the theater

port unities open.

Start Poster Competition

The annual advertising poster con-
test has started and anyone wishing to
compete is urged to see Paul Cullom,
Abbott, who will give them the nec-
essary information.

Four important lyrics, in addition to
three more recently written, have not
as yet had umsic composed for them.
They are the Opening chorus, “We’re
the Campus Women,” “Please
Louise,” and “Tag Along With Me."
Anyone interested in musical composi-
tion is advised to see Cullom.

The title of the Blackfriar show
which was changed at Mr. Coleman’s
request will be announced soon.
Watch the Daily Maroon for the
story.

Whistle Will Be
Louder This Spring

As one of the greatest achieve-
ments of the year, and indeed, in
the history of The Daily Maroon,
the Whistle club has been organ-
ized on a sound basis.

Under the leadership of Leo
Stone, alias Terrible Turk, the con-
tributors to the Whistle column
have been brought together and an
organization formed that will add
to worth of the column in future
years. The club has elected offi-
cers and has been officially recog-
nized as a University society.

OPEN MAROON WEEK

WITH WOMEN’S TEA

Today, at 4, in Ida Noyes hall,
the women of the sales-staff of The
Daily Maroon for Maroon Week
will be entertained at a tea, held in
their honor, for the purpose of
making plans for carving out the
week's campaign. Ruth Burtis, who
has been appointed as head of the
Maroon Week sales drive, will talk
on the object of the Week, and out-
line her plans for the division of.
the sales force, and the routine of
the work.

A luncheon for the sales force
will be held Wednesday at noon in
the private dining room of Hutchin-
son Commons. By this time, the
Week will be well under way, and
the final swing of the drive will be
started at the luncheon.

BARCLAY DRAWS

CAMPUS WOMAN

Sketches Local Girl For April
Phoenix

Who is she?

This question has been making the
rounds of the campus as a rumor cir-
culates that a campus girl’s portrait
will dignify the next issue of the
Phoenix, scheduled for April 15. Mc-
Clelland Barclay, world-famous cover
artist, has “done” the face of a Uni-
versity woman selected for—well, as
Handschy says, her being most repre-
sentative of a college type.

Just what the next issue will be
is a mystery of some sort, as mysteri-
ous as the identity of the fair model
for its cover, but the editorial board
promises it to be the knock-out of
the year, from the much-talked-of
cover to the colorful cigarette ad on
the back page. As the next to the
last issue of the year, it will contain,
according to the editor, the most diver-
sified material submitted since last
October.

Handschy and Walt Williamson,
selected three women whom they con-
sidered typical of college beauty. Of
these three Mr. Barclay selected his
favorite type. “The young lady is
very popular.” thinks Haffdschy. “and
the portrait looks not at all like her.”

Barclay’ draws for “The Country
Gentleman," “College Humor.” and
“Fisher” bodies.

MACK EVANS NAMES
FINAL TRYOUT DATE

FOR CHOIR POSITIONS

Tryouts for positions in the Univer-
sity choir will be held up to and in-
cluding Thursday. April 15. Appoint-
ments for tryouts should be made with
Mack Evans, choir master, after
chapel any day this week. A num-
ber of positions are vacant and this is
an opportunity for new men and wo-
men to gain entrance, according to
Mr. Evans. Also all former members
of the choir should make appointments
for retrials.

All students of the University, who
are interested have been requested to
attend the tryouts. Unclassified stu-
dents and students who do not attend
chapel should address a card to the
Faculty Exchange, in arranging for
appointments.

Mr. Evans is well known for the
excellence of the choir music he pro-
duces. His choral rendition of the
Venite chant has aroused student
and faculty admiration according to
Mr. Soares.

AWARD NINETEEN
FROSH NUMERALS

IN TWO SPORTS

Grappling, Tank Coaches
Are Pleased With

Prospects

This year’s lot Freshman athletes
seem to have been rather capable
according to the enthusiastic re-
ports which the coaches have been
giving out about their numeral men.
Now comes he welcome news from
Coach Vorres that in his opinion
and in the opinion of his assistants
and all of the wrestling fans, the
Maroon wrestling prospects for next
winter look exceedingly bright. The
only regular lost by graduation is
I Captain George Graha, 137 pound-!
| er, who won his event in every dual
1 meet of the past season. *

.The men who won the khaki wrest- |
i ling numerals are David Kreuger, ;
Frosh captain, Louise Levine, D. i
Berkenshaw, J. Watson, E. W. I
Green, C. Erickson, F. Simmerling, |
E. Coyle, E. Changnon, M. Proud-
foot, and C. E. Bury. The Fresh-
men are just about ideally divided in
the classes as to the matter of weight
and thus a well balanced supply of
material to make up next year’s
team is assured.

The yearling tankmen also finished
their season in great shape and many
new prospects were uncovered. Many
of the Frosh swimmers made excep-
tionally fast time in the various
meets of the season and most of them
should make next year’s varsity
swiming team.

Discover Campus
Poet; Breen Has

Song on Market

John Bartholemew Breen, in charge
of the supply room of the physiology
department, has turned from the grue-
some work of his department to the
other extreme, with the publication
of his song “That Old Highway."
x Familiar to students and faculty
alike as the campus poet, Mr. Breen
found the inspiration for his first musi-
cal composition in the painting of an
old farmhouse. After writing the1
poem, Mr. Breen decided to set it to
music. J. Charles Craigun. formerly
instructor in music at the University,
and an old friend of Breen’s, arranged
the melody, and McKinley is publish-
ing it.

“The thing that makes my song-
writing seem strange even to myself
is that my work can scarcely be in-
spirational to music—and still it has
proven so,” explains the poet-com-
poser. “ ‘That Old Highway’ is the
first piece of music I have ever at-
tempted.”

GRADOVA PLAYS IN

MANDEL TOMORROW

The University Orchestra Associa-
tion, April 6th, will present Mme.
Gitta Gredova, internationally famed
pianist, in a recital.

Through the Association the Uni-
versity has for several years been
offered excellent opportunities for
aesthetic stimulation, not only in
orchestral presentation but in small
group and solo recitals as well. Re-
nowned artists from all parts of the
world have been secured through
their efforts.

EMINENT ALUMNUS
RETURNS FOR VISIT

Laurence E. Salisbury, a graduate
of the University, who has for a
number of years been prominent in
the United States diplomatic serv-
ice, paid a visit to his Alma Mater
yesterday, while spending a few
days in the city.

He has spent the last several
years as U. S. Consul at Nagasaki,
and will return to Japan shortly as
secretary of the embassy there.

During his visit here yesterday,
be had dinner with Frank H.
O’Hara. He spent much of his
time here in renewing old acquaint-
ances.

Mr. Salisbury, while at the Uni-
versity, was a member of Owl and
Serpent and Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity. He devoted a large part
of his time to student activities.

HALF OF MARS

DRY AS SAHARA

Local Astronomers Make
Important Observations

One half of Mars is as dry as the
Sahara desert it was revealed in a
spectrum study of the fiery planet re-
ported yesterday in the astrophysical
Journal of the University. This study,
conducted by Walter S. Adams and
Charles E. St. John, at Mt. Wilson
observatory, shows accurately how
much water vapor is present in the
| Martian atmosphere over the hemi-
! sphere that was turned toward the
j earth when the observations were
! made.

It was Spring on Mars when the
spectrum was recorded the investiga-
■ tors state.

The quantity of water-vapor in the
atmosphere of Mars, area for area was
found to be six per cent of that over
Mt. Wilson and three per cent of that
over Pasadena. California. Accord-
ing to the scientists this indicates ex-
treme desert conditions over the
I greater portion of the Martian hemi-
sphere toward the earth at that time.
The oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars
was found to be sixteen per cent, area
for area, of that over Mt. Wilson, or
about two-thirds of that in. the earth’s
atmosphere above Mt. Everest.

ANNOUNCE ELECTION
RESULTS TO SPORTS

BOARD OF W. A. A.

Sports representatives for the
W. A. A. board were elected at an
open meeting held last Thursday at
3:30 in the gymnasium on the second
floor of Ida Noyes hall. The results
of the elections are as follows: Bea-
trice Nesbit, unorganized sports rep-
resentative; Eloise White, gymnasium
representative, and Madi Bacon, horse-
back riding representative.

Other matters decided at the meet-
ing were the election of Eleanor Fish
to the position of chairman of the
lodge, and the presentation of numerals
to members of last year’s Freshman
baseball team.

Dues which are fifty cents a quarter
should be paid by W. A. A. members
promptly to Marjorie Burrell, treas-
urer of the organization.

“Because many women neglect to
pay their dues a great deal of
troubles resolves on the officers,”
said Miss Burrell. “For this reason
they should be paid immediately.

NUMEROUS DIVERTISSMENTS OFFERED
CAMPUS RY GREATER MAROON DRIVE;

TEA IN IDA NOYES FOR SALESWOMEN

Tea, Luncheon and Mixer
High Spots Of
Festivity

By Reese H. Price

Several events will stand out
prominently as the most important
features of Maroon week, which is
to end in the most important of all,
—the Maroon Mixer to be held Fri-
day at 4 in the Reynolds club.

Tea This Afternoon

Preceding the Mixer, however,
there is to be a tea for the staff of
thirty-five saleswomen this afternoon
in Ida Noyes hall, and a luncheon for
the staff on Wednesday afternoon.
At these affairs, the progress of the
drive will be discussed, and plans
made for the continuation of the
campaign.

The whole idea of Maroon week
is to put across to the campus the
fact that The Daily Maroon is al-
ways trying to go forward, to de-
velop, and to give the campus the
kind of a paper that the campus
would like to have. Maroon Week
is the week in which the staff is try-
ing to put The Daily Maroon in the
eyes of the public on campus, so
that those who read it may see its
good points, and its bad points, and
give it to the staff any helpful ideas
and criticisms that they may wish.

Try to Connect Campus

Through the services of the staff
of saleswomen, under Ruth Burtis,
The Daily Maroon is trying to place
its service into a larger number of
hands, and trying to reach out and
connect all parts of the campus more
! closely together.

FORMER UNIVERSITY

George Lusk, a former student of
the University, has been awarded one

brilliant record in the Cahrles Univer-
sity of Prague where he is making a
particular study of the psychology
of Aesthetics,
i

Eleven men from various univer-
sities throughout the country have
also been awarded fellowships by the

“Sunny” Burtis Makes Four
Teams of Women;

Meet Today

By Walter G. Williamson

Maroon week with its attendant
festivities and supplementary fea-
tures officially opens today with this
special extra. Culminating a week
of extensive preparation by Ruth
Burtis, general chairman, and her
committee of thirty-five women the
drive for new subscriptions promises
to be the most comprehensive in the
history of The Daily Maroon.

Form Team*

For the convenience of the student
body Miss Burtis has divided her
committeewomen into four teams so
that all parts of the campus will be
proportionately covered. The four
teams will be in competition for to-
tal sales during the week. The four
girls chosen by Miss Burtis to cap-
tain the teams are Betsy Farwell,
Katherine Rose, Ruth DeWitt, and
Helen Lambom. Team selections
will be made at a tea for the sales-
women today at 4 in Ida Noyes hall.
Mr. Frank O’Hara, director of Stu-
dent Activities and Tom Mulroy,
business manager of the Daily Ma-
roon will speak. All women must
be present at this 'first meeting.

Low Subscription Rate

Subscriptions may be secured from
saleswomen for one dollar. This sub-
scription will include all of the ad-
ditional features planned by the pa-
per. A literary supplement will be
issued every two weeks at no addi-
tional charge. Men and women fa-
mous in the literary field have prom-
isued articles from time to time. This
supplement will be an innovation at
the University.

Following the tea which is spon-
sored by The Daily Maroon for the
staff of saleswomen there will be a
luncheon Wednesday. At these meet-
ings reports will be made on the
progress of the drive. An all-uni-
versity mixer Friday will climax the
week.

“Maroon week is an effort of the
paper to reach the greatest number
of students,” said Mulroy. “It is sur-
prising how few students keep in
touch with the trend of undergrad-
uate life. The paper is the only
means through which the current
events of the quadrangles are accur-
ately recorded. Every student should
be a subscriber for his own good.”

MICHIGAN PROFESSOR
COMPARES AMERICAN,
FRENCH UNIVERSITIES

‘Michigan is typical of the Ameri-
can system of university which since
the war has had such an influence
upon France, said Dr. Charles Ces-
tre, exchange professor from the
Sorbonne.”

So reads an excerpt from the
Michigan Daily, giving an interview
with the above professor. The story
continues:

“While university life in France
is more intellectual, according to Dr.
Cestre, and more personal effort is
exerted, the comradeship of Ameri-
can universities which develops good
citizenship is lacking.”

The professor continued with a
comparison of French and American
universities, showing that French
students confine themselves to one
specific field. In speaking of cam-
pus activities. Dr. Cestre ex-
pressed himself as being in favor
of them but stated that he thought
that they were rather overdone.

There is a cycle of fashion
not only for the hats col-

line of work into which
they go.

But your job has to fit
your head as well as your
hat, for it has to fit your
state of mind.

Like your hat also, your
job needs to fit your purse.
Therefore, why not choose
one that brings not only
satisfaction in service but
in financial return.

Selling life insurance is one
of the few modern busi-
nesses that does just this.
It takes'.

How would you fit in 2

If you have attended college to become
fitted to enter the business world, the
question you must now decide is where
to start. This is a matter not to be
considered lightly.

During the past few weeks, opportunities
for college men in the Kresge organiza-
tion have been brought to your attention
in this publication. A few of the college
men who are now enjoying success in
this great national institution have
briefly told you of their experiences.

In a very short time, we expect to have
a man from your own college to inter-
view you, if you are interested in
learning, first hand, more about the
opportunities offered for training and
promotion in the Kresge stores. Write
at once for an appointment. Our repre-
sentative will tell you frankly whether
or not he thinks you will fit in.

Upon the decision you make now
probably depends your entire future
career.

SIMON H. WAUGAMAN

from high school teacher
to manager Louisville Store
After attending Mercertburg Arade>
my and graduating from Franklin
and Marshall College in 1917, Mr.
Waugaman enlisted with the regular
army and served more than two
years.

Following the war, he taught school
for a time but was unsettled and
restless to make a real future for
himself. Here is what he hat to say:
"While in Grand Rapids, I heard a
lot about the Kresge system of train-
ing for store managers, and oppor-
tunity for advancement. The future
that was pictured could not help but
attract me. So I applied for a posi-
tion in the stockroom of that store.
"Many of my friend* and associate*
who had never known of the Kresge
Company, a* a place where a real
future ia offered to the man who ia
willing to put forth real effort to
attain success, gave me little, if any
encouragement. My mind had been
made up, however, and I stuck.

"The futifte is unlimited, aa 1 posi-
tively know, and there ia always that
incentive to keep on ’plugging’.
The man who is smbitious cannot
pass up such a proposition as ours.
And on top or it all, the Krea^s
Company is one of the most Demo-
cratic organisations where results
•lone, and not influence, get you
there.”
