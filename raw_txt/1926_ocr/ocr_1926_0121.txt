COMMITTEE TO NAME
ALL NOMINEES FOR

Y. M. C. A. ELECTIONS

With the approach of the season
for the annual Y. M. C. A. election
of officers, Charles Anderson, presi-
dent of the association has appointed
three men to act as a nominating
committee: Martin Carlson, chair-
man, Allen Miller, and Arthur Frit-
schel.

These men, all of whom are mem-
bers of the senior class, are to can-
vass the field of men eligible to hold
the offices of the association and to
make a report to the cabinet. This
group will hold its weekly meeting
on Tuesday and it is expected that
the committee will at that time
present a list of prospective candi-
dates.

“Suggestions for nominees given
by members of the association and
their friends will be gladly accepted,
said Carlson. “This will aid us in
our canvass for the most likely can-
didates.”

Only members of the Y. M. C. A.,
whose names are on the lists by F eb.
1, will be eligible to vote at the elec-
tion. Although the date for casting
Fallots has not been determined
upon, it was indicated that they
would be held either in February or
by the first of March. All men of the
undergraduate student body are
eligible to hold offices, and not only
cabinet members, as has commonly
been the opinion.

GREEKS NEGLIGENT
CONCERNING YEAR
BOOK PHOTOGRAPHS

Owing to the negligence of various
fraternity men, only fifty per cent of
the photographs for the 1926 Cap and
Gown have been taken, and of these
half the proofs have not been returned,
a statement given out yesterday by
Richard Scholz, associate editor, de-
clared. 'He wishes to impress upon the
student body that they already have
had at least three months to have
their pictures taken, and that the dead-
line for having pictures taken is Satur-
day, Jan. 23. It is imperative that all
proofs be returned before Saturday,
Jan. 30; otherwise the picture will be
omitted from the fraternity or club
group.

You can now pick the most handsome

Today's canvassing resulted in the
nomination of Ed Scott—Eleanor Rice
said that she thought Ed Scott and Lucy
Lamon are the best looking couple on
campus; therefore Ed Scott, per se, is
the best looking man.

Interviews with other women on the
campus resulted in more votes of Walter
Marks and Walter Williamson, botH
of whom seem to be going strong in all
the wards. The dope is that a lot of
political cliques are going to be formed
and that the caucuses are going to fall
into the hands of the bosses.

Come to the polls early for much con-
gestion is expected, though The Daily
Maroon is not anticipating (nor abso-
lutely prohibiting) that violent means
will be resorted to by the good looking
men to secure a landslide.

Proves Existence
of Universe Like

Our Own Galaxy

“Are yon trying to usurp the Hearst
puHicatoins as leaders in a certain type
of journalism?”

“Aren’t zee perhaps, a little more ma-
ture. even a little more sophisticated?’'

“We ask you, arc we a college or a
university?. .Are we^going to permit the
Tribune to talk about “co-eds” engaging
in “collegiate” beauty contests, to make
us sound like Podunk college, to give us
a rah-rah spirit, and to hold us up for
the justifiable criticism of those zvho
have always believed the University of
Chicago to be a grozvn up institution of
learning?”

Questions like these, letters of protest
from defendants of the University’s
reputation, attacks upon The Daily Ma-
roon as an instrument of cheap public-
ity, have filled the mailman's bag ever
since The Daily Maroon began its
search of the Quadrangles for a hand-
some man. Readers who scorn such
tiffing, readers who fear its effect on
the Development campaign, readers who
think it isn’t quite the sort of thing col-
lege people ought to do—all these have
taken their pens in hand.

The editor of a college comic has
written a withering tirade. An aide-de-
camp to the deans of women objects
to our humiliating our athletes, our in-
tellectuals, and our campus leaders, by
pointing out their physiognomies to the
public. A leader of her class, being
asked the name of her Apollo, turned on
her heel, turned up her nose, and turned
the over-bold reporter down. “You may
NOT use my name in connection with

gathering today, and the grievances
that have heretofore been confined to
the fraternity house will reach the
ears of authority through the Under-
graduate council. For the plan of
asking seniors to air their complaints
and suggestions on the Alma Mater
is a step in the “All for Chicago”
campaign that the council has re-
cently devised.

After the fourth year men and
women have expressed their opinions
in writing, the questionnaires will be
collected and placed in the hands of
the Undergraduate council. Mem-
bers of the council will sort the crit-
icisms, and place them in the hands
of twenty committees who will bring

the matters before
tion.

Want your death notice typed? Or

Or merely your thesis multigraphed?
Then direct your steps to the right half
of Lexington hall, otherwise the Type-
writing office. We sent our footsteps
in that direction for none of these rea-
sons, but simply for curiosity.

“Once upon a time, long, long ago,”
the lady in charge began, “the Typewrit-
ing office, under the direction of the C.
& A. College, was tn Cobb hall. When
the C. & A. moved to the new building,
the Typewriting office was shuffled over
here in Lexington, and here we have
remained, and will remain, probably,
until some grateful grad, endows a new
building for us!”

“What sort of things do you type?”

"Most of our work is for the C. &
A. college. You see, students in the C.

been arranged for these two meet-
ings, members of the club participat-
ing. “This is for the purpose of stim-
ulating any special abilities any of
the club members may have,” said

Fred Mudge, president
ization, last night.

Reservations for the
be made to George

of the organ-

dinner should

Poole, 5727

& A. are charged a material fee of
dollars: this fee covers the cost of
mineographed sheets that,we make

them, and
texts.”

“Do you
tions over

which they use instead

ten
the
for
of

type the examination ques-
here?” we asked hopefully.

“Very seldom!” the L. in C. laughed.
“And when we do, we take pains to see
that the students who do the work (yes.
we employ over twenty students in this
office!) are not in that particular doss’”

“Baffled again!” we crt*d sorrow-
fully, heading for

Woodlawn Avenue, within the next
few days. The dinners are under the
general supervision of the program
committee, of which Arthur Collat
is chairman. Rainey Bennett is a
member of this committee, and his
newly organized syncopators will fur-
nish the music for the meal. The
third member of the committee will
be announced later.

Paul Cullom, head of the Intra-
Murals, and Prof. James Weber Linn
of the English department have
been requested to speak at the din-
ner, according to Collat.

Seek Suggestion*

In a letter sent to all the members
of the club by Mudge, a request for
suggestions for the dinner program
was made. This was made with the
idea of maintaining the member’s
interest in the organization.

At the second of the two meet-
ings a program for the spring quar-
ter will be made out, and committees
formed to supervise the carrying out
of the program. The work of the
spring quarter will end with plans for
the selection of next year’s class.

Leaders of the 1926 Washington
Prom yesterday completed arrange-
ments to hold the year’s outstanding
social event at the South Shore coun-
try club, where the proms of several
years past have been staged. Special
concessions by the club have made it
possible to continue the custom, it
is announced. The date, as previous-
ly announced, February 19, is satis-
factory to the club, it is stated.

Tickets will be allotted Wednes-
day. The number will be limited to
350, as in 1925, and the price will
also be the same as last year, $6.60.
Members of all classes may attend
the prom, but tickets will be distri-
buted under the auspices of the
senior class.

Await Selection of Orchestra

No orchestra has yet been selected
for the affair, but bids have been
received from some of the best dance
music organizations in the city, and
are now under consideration, the
leaders state. Their choice will be
announced in an early issue of The
Maroon.

The grand march and the midnight
supper are the big features of the ev-
ening. The march will open the
prom this year, though formerly it
was held later in the evening. The
leaders announce that the march
will proceed promptly at 10 o’clock.
Plans which have been made for
these two features insure that they
will be equal to those of former
proms, according to those in charge
of the affair. The march will be led
by Paul Cullom, Lucy Lamon, Gra-
ham Kernwein and Catherine Camp-
bell, who also have charge of the ad-
vance arrangements.

Provide For Transportation

Taxis in sufficient number to "ac-
commodate the prom-goers will be
available at the close if the efforts
of the leaders to make the necessary
arrangements are successful. In
previous years it has been difficult
to obtain transportation for all, and
the leaders have undertaken to elim-
inate this inconvenience for the 1926
prom. ~

SALESGIRLS VEND
JANUARY PHOENIX
ON CAMPUS TODAY

Effervescing with warmth of every
description the “Hot Number” of the
Phoenix makes its appearance on
campus today.

Among the leading features of the
issue are details of the much-herald-
ed “college flivver” contest. Condi-
tions, regulations and prizes of the
competition are dealt with at length
by the editor.

“The letters of Viola X”, being
the true personal episodes of a frat-
ernity house cook, have caught the
interest of the weaker sex whose in-
terests in the Greek domiciles have
been confined to occasional dances,
when the house is on exhibition and
the boys on their best behavior.

Rainey Bennett, the freshman
whose campus work has provoked
much favor among students and art
critics, has executed the cover for the
“Hot Number.”

Bill Cotant, James Root, and Jane
Bruenning have done their part along
the pictorial line, while the regular
editorial contributors adorn the mag-
azine with a wide range of humor

'T'WO protests against Tbe Daily

-“- some man are printed below:
To the Honorable Editor of the

Maroon:

We have been watching the
Maroon with interest. We have
been reading the editorials faith-
fully and even appreciatively.
We have decided to co-operate
and buy a class tocque. And just
when we are beginning to feel
proud of our paper and its spirit
we find this staring at us: “Ques-
tion Campus Authorities About
Male Pulchritude.”

We ask you, are we a college
or a university? Are we going to
permit the Tribune to talk about
Chicago co-eds engaging in col-
legiate beauty contests, to make
us sound like Podunk college, to
give us a rah-rah spirit, and to
hold us up for the justifiable criti-
cism of those who have always
believed the University of Chi-
cago to be a grown up institution
of learning?

And what about the men them
selves? Do the athlete, the in-
tellectual, and the class leader
enjoy having the details of their
physiognomy pointed out to the
public? Do they derive any sat-
isfaction from such publicity?
Does it not rather humiliate
them?

And the women? Do they
want their personal views adver-
tised and do they wish to be
classed as co-eds? Why not
quote some of the finer and more
worth-while statements our
‘‘prominent campus women
make?

I sincerely hope that a suffi-
cient number of Maroon support-
ters will protest against the
search for a campus Apollo and
that something more in keeping
with the spirit of our University
will be substituted.

With best wishes for success
in maintaining the hitherto high
standards of the paper,

—MONA VOLKERT

Maroon’s search for a hand-

To The Editor,

The Daily Maroon.

Dear Mister:

What is your estimable publication
trying to do, wreck the Dear Old
Institution?

Or are you trying to usurp the
Hearst Publications as leaders in a
certain type of journalism?

Or are you merely offering their
campus correspondents a new field
for endeavour?

Or are you badly in need of some-
thing which will fill space?

In any case, whatever your motive
may be, I hardly think your latest
attempt is commendable unless you
offer a Five Passenger Enclosed
Drive Jewett Sedan, a Home in Hol-
lywood, Florida, a complete ward-
robe from the best Gent’s Clothiers,
and a year’s contract with the Gold
and Feingold Motion Picture Com-
pany to the winner of your new
Male Beauty Contest.

On the other hand, you may be of-
fering something very fine: perhaps
you are about to develop something
new in the way of Rushing Lines.
In years hence, perhaps it will be
possible for Fraternity men to in-
form the innocent freshmen that
the Handsomest Man on Campus is
an honored member of their organ-
ization.

When I was a Freshman in this
University of Chicago, the Editor of
the humor section of the Cap and
Gown was facetiously considering
such a Contest. It might have been
great material for the humor section
I of any publication. But he hesitated,
because the downtown papers got the
d,ope, and photographs of the pro-
posed winners of the contest. And
we realised at that time that such
publicity is rather cheap, not only
for the individual, but for any col-
lege publication.

Perhaps such things are done at
some DinkyDinky College, where
College Spirit, as they call it, is the
really prized thing. Aren’t we per-
haps, a little more mature, even a
little more sophisticated?

Yours in Publication,

—FRED HANDSCHY

(Continued . om page 1)
that something ought to be done about
it, (b) that somebody ought to put a
stop to it, and (c) that there ought to
be a law against it.

The historic beauty contest of 1923
has been cited, as a warning to the pro-
moters of this project. “We realized at
that time,” writes the angry comic
editor, “that such publicity is rather
cheap, not only for the individual, but
for any college publication.”

“And the women?”—here is another
warning The Daily Maroon has received
“Do they want their personal views ad-
vertised?” asks one writer. “Do they
wish to be classed as co-eds?” Univer-
sity women, in the belief of this corre-
spondent, sometimes have thoughts more
worthy of print, than the criticism of
their Charleston companions. “Why
not,” the letter continues, “why not
quote some of the finer and more worth-
while statements our ‘prominent campus
women' make?”

The editor of the comic, appropriately
enough, has enlisted sarcasm to aid him
in his attack. “In any case.” he says
after working up to a climax, “in any
case, whatever your motive may be, I
hardly think your latest attempt is com-
mendable unless you offer a Five Pas-
senger Enclosed Drive Jewett Sedan, a
Home in Hollywood, Florida, a com-
plete wardrobe from the best Gent’s
Clothiers, and a year’s contract with the
Gold and Geingold Motion Picture Com-
pany to the winner of your new Male
Beauty Contest.”

More readers will probably rise to
complain as the man hunt continues.
At least, one critic hopes so. “I sin-
cerely hope,” to quote once more, "that
a sufficient number of Maroon support-
ers will protest against the search for
a campus Apollo and that something
more in keeping with the spirit of our
University will be substituted.”

(Full and exact texts of the letters
quoted above and name* of the writ-
er* will be found in the editorial
column.)

urements, Dr. Hubble states: “The pres-
ent investigation identifies N. G. C. 6822
(the numerical classification of the gal-
axy) as an isolated system of stars and
nebulae of the same type as the Ma-
gellanic Clouds, although somewhat
smaller and much more distant. A con-
sistent structure is thus reared on the
foundation of the Cepheid criterion, in
which the dimensions, luminosities and
densities, both of the system as a whole
and of its separate numbers, are of or-
ders of magnitude which are thoroughly
familiar. The distance is the only
quantity of a new order.

“The principle of the uniformity of
nature seems to rule undisturbed in this
remote region of space. The principle
of the fundamental assumption in all
extrapolations beyond the limits of
known and observable data, and specula-

Chi and the Phi Gams take on the
Chi Psis in the opening games of the
season. Reservations have been made
with the Reynolds club for the use
of their alleys again this year and
their cooperation, which helped to
■make this sport so successful last
winter, has again been offered to the
Intramural Department.

Grouped Into League

According to Carl Erickson, Intra-
mural manager, the several teams to
be grouped into leagues, after the
system of play used last season.
These leagues are to be announced
tomorrow, and will consist of four
fraternity and one independent
groupings of six teams each.

Another handsome array of awards
has been provided by the department
for this event Loving cups galore
are offered to the best teams as
prizes to the winner of each league,
to the champion of the University,
and to the runner-up in the finals.
Several medalletes, gold, silver, and
bronze, are to be presented to the
five high point men for the season,
based on individual showings, and to
the members of both the champion-
ship team and the runners-up.

Chance To Win Honor*

Besides all these inducements for
the contesting organizations to turn
out winning teams is the chance they
have to win Big Ten honors. By
making arrangements with the In-
tramural Department at Ohio State
university all the local teams are
automatically made contestants in
the Annual Telegraphic Meet to de-
cide the championship Intramural
Bowling teams of the Western Con-
ference. Three ten-frame games are
required from each team and the
scores are telegraphed to the Ohio
State official who compare the results
and decide the winners. A huge cup
is presented to the championship or-
ganization and this trophy should be
cherished by the -winners as one of
of intramural competition.

Crisler’s Yearlings

Fast in Scrimmage

Fritz Crisler’s yearling eagers have
been showing a more thorough under-
•■ standing of the fundamentals of basket-
ball during the past week than they have
since the start of practice. Fourteen
field goals were courted for Gist, the
lanky frosh tip off man, when the regu-
lars scrimmaged the reserves.

Bob Kaplan and Cooper also have
shown uncanny eyes for the basket. The
guards, Marshall and Williams, are two
big fellows who rarely let a man break
through and the reserves failed to score
a basket on these guards in tbout twenty
minutes of play.

The second squad lacks the polish of
such stars as Gist and Kaplan who have
many years of high school experience
behind them. Sonny Goodman, Mc-
Ewen, McCarthy, McGregor, and Fell-
heimer are pressing the regulars closely.

Not until next week, when Fritz pits
his freshmen against the tight guard-
ing of the varsity will he be able to ob-
tain an idea of the real strength of the
first year men.	I

WHAT o/ IT’

fGROI^E MORGENSTERN

Last Saturday night Prof. Frank
Hurburt O’Hara and I found our-
selves in company bound for the
Bartlett swimming pool, where aqua-
tic sports of various kinds were the
disorder of the day. We arrived rath-
er late—no earlier, in fact, than just
before the water polo game. The
athletes were disporting in the tank
as we entered, warming up or wet-
ting up or whatever it is you do if
you’re a water polo player.

Prof. O’Hara’s knowledge of
sports, he said, was inclined to be
limited, even though he had deliv-
ered a speech at a football pep ses-
sion in his day, so he applied to me
for light on the great game of water
polo. I was, however, in somewhat
the same predicament as Prof.
O’Hara, for this was the first time
I had ever been present at an ex-
hibition of the noble game. Assum-
ing a knowing look, however, I gave
Mr. O’Hara to understand that, even
as a little child, I had been consid-
ered an authority on the spert.

“Water polo,” said I, “has sup-
planted water basketball in the Big
Ten this season, and it is much more
refined and gentle. In the good old
days, you understand, water basket-
ball was anything but a gentleman’s
game. “Personal contact” was allow-
ed, and that meant ANYTHING. A
reminiscent look came into my eyes
as I went on, “Well do I remember
when we had our championship team
in 1923 around here. Many’s the
time one of our Maroons would go
into a clinch with a guy over the
ball. Usually it would end up by
both of them going under water,
locked in one of them death-grips.
Well, after a while the ball would
come up, all right, but frequently.”
and here I sank my voice to a faint,
husky whisper, “they’d have to
dredge bottom for the MEN.” Mr.
O’Hara, T thought, looked uneasily
about him.

“Now. however.” I resumed. “Hr*
is no more. Water nolo h” r^nlnr^

With the entries showing unusual
strength and ability, especially among
the heavier men, the Intramural wrest-

down the number in each weight class
to four men gave promise of thrilling
bouts to come in the finals Friday.

Feature bouts were those lietween Stan

Changnon. In addition to natural ag-
gressiveness and unusual strength a con-
siderable knowledge of the technic of
the game was shown.

men from the state of Illinois, three of.
whom are practically assured of regular '
berths, the Badger basketball squad bids
fair to become an all Illinois aggrega-1

ers” who are now holding down regular
positions on the varsity.

There are also two subs in Ey and
Ellerman. Andrews and Behr both hail |
from Rockford and were members of,
that famous high school team which,
threatened to win the national a few i
years ago.

Ey comes from Mount Pulaski while
Merkle and Ellerman are products of
the city high schools of Chicago. Mer-
kle, although one of the lightest guards
who is appearing on conference floors,
is rapidly making a name for himself
and is a fit successor to Diebold, Wis-
consin’s great guard who graduated last
spring. .

Win Over Maroons

Urbana, Illinois, January 20—
Filled with confidence as a result
of their last minute defeat of
Michigan, Coach Craig Ruby’s
orange and blue proteges were
working hard tonight in prepara-
tion for their invasion of the Mid-
way Saturday. The Chicago game
is always a big one for the locals
and in addition the conference
leadership depends on the outcome
of the week-end encounter.

Chicago, looked upon earlier in
the season as one of the week sis-
ters of the conference pulled the
unexpected by downing the strong
Badgers and is expected to put up
a good fight. The final line up has
not been announced but it is ex-
pected that several men will see
action in each position with John-
ny Mauer and “Pug” Daughterly
sure starters.

WOMEN ORGANIZE

SPLASH CLASSES

The main feature of women’s sports
for the Winter quarter will be the or-
ganization of tfie four class teams in
swimming. All the members of the
3:30 class will be eligible to try out for
their respective class teams. The four
teams will be Freshman, Sophomore,
Junior and Senior respectively.

Beside the clas steams, Tarpon club is
busy organizing yearns and holding try-
outs. Tryouts are held any open hour
Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4:30 or Fri-
days at 3:30. Judges are always pres-
ent at these hours, and all those inter-
ested in swimming are eligible. Tarpon
is anticipating the organization of water
polo teams, something entirely new in
women's sports.

Due to the recent change in per-
sonnel in the circulation department,
in which F. H. Kretschmer was made
Circulation Manager, there may be
a few cases at first in which a sub-
scriber is not receiving his Maroon
regularly. It will be appreciated if
any non-delivery is reported, so that
the delivery service can be perfected
as soon as possible.

Various meets will also be a feature
of the Wniter quarter in the line of
swimming.

MAROONS LEAD AT HALF, BUT ARE
OVERCOME IN SENSATIONAL FINAL
PERIOD OF EXCITING CAGE GAME

Win Puts Boilermakers in Conference Basket Lead With
One Victory Better Than the Other
Championship Contenders

By Victor Roteru*

There was no three-yard line to
stop that elusive Spradling and his
Purdue team-mates last night, and
they, recalling their bitter football
reversal of last fall, swept on to a
brilliant 24-17 victory over the fight-
ing Maroons. Trailing at half-time
7-3, due to the gilt-edged backguard-
ing of McDonough and Hoerger, Pur-
due exposed all their tricky lore to
tie and then creep slowly away from
their opponents.

Spradling Stars

There was no question in the
minds of the Bartlett patrons as to
who was the outstanding basketeer
of the evening. Spradling saw to that.
At half-tme someone in the gallery
shouted “Where’s this guy Sprad-
ling?” His call was soon answered
and from then on Spradling proceed-
ed with business-like activity to es-
tablish his identity by keeping the
netting swinging with his shots until
he had accumulated 16 points for
himself and the game for Purdue.
Once started the Maroon guards

found considerable difficulty in at-
tempting to cope with his aggressive
dribbling and work underneath the
basket.

For the Maroons Hank Sackett put
in a night’s work of which he may
well be proud. Besides scoring seven
points he contributed more than his
share in the floor-work. The guards
after holding the invaders without a
field basket in the first half were un-
able to keep up this gallant pace af-
ter the repeated onslaughts of the
famed Purdue offense but, all in all,
they made a very commendable show-
ing.

Capacity Crowd Attend*

The crowd which jammed every
nook of Bartlett gym rocked the an-
cient building with their lusty cheers
as the playing became tense during
the second half. As the throng went
home they voted it a highly satisfac-
tory evening.

Sackett’s looping shot from near
the foul-line opened the scoring, but
Spradling tossed in two free-throws

Sir:

I take this opportunity to present
to your notice a deplorable condition
existing on the campus of this haven
of Enlightenment. Recently, it seems
they have started a male beauty con-
test—a shameless exposal of our
glorious American manhood to the
impertinent gaze of a depraved pop-
ulace. And at the same time they
have introduced a general custom of
wearing woolen tocques while on
campus. Now I ask you, how in the
name of Apollo can a fellow accede
to the one tradition and still have a
chance in the competition?

“Look,” I said, “they’re beginning
to play.” Such, indeed, was the case.
An official planted in a spy-tower in
the center of the pool waved a little
flag; “Play ball!” howled Parker
Hall, who seemed to be play-director,
and the boys went to it. Things went j
on for a few moments, and after in-

“Child’s play, that; very refined end

sage opinion, the referee’s whistle
blew. “You’re out,” said he sternly, I
pointing to one of the combatants, I

“A scuffle after the ball in the

repeated several times more during

the first period was over, Mr. O’Hara

the foul line to break this
Sackett’s rebound throw was

and Zimmerman followed this with
another point to end the scoring for
the half at 7-3. Immediately after
through the entire Maroon team to
score. A long shot by Neuman again
brought the teams on even terms.
Then for the major part of the half
the score seesawed dizzily. With

Spradling in the leading role clinch-

“Merely a passing incident,’’ I re-
marked, “things are so dead in this
game that I’ve got a good notion of
walking out on it and going upstairs
to see what the fencers and gymnasts
have to offer—and that,” I continued,

Something

whizzed by my ear, and I looked

lentless ill-will of the gentlemen in
the tank, who with persevering cun-
ning spooted us in our perch and
bowled the ominous ball in our di-
rection with a savage fury that knew
no bounds. “We ain’t safe nowhere,”
said Mr. O’Hara, dodging with prac-
tised ease one of these pet-shots. But
after a time we began to feel easy
again, for we appeared to be out of
range. Not so the spectators in the
stands, however, for several of them
were singled out by the gentlemen in
the tank and unmercifully pelted
with that horrible ball from time to
time. “Well,” remarked Prof. O’Hara
as we made our way out at the term-
ination of activities, “for a refined
and gentle pastime, give me crokin-
ole.”

No doubt you have been considering numerous
offers of employment, many of which have struck
you favorably. But remember—a wise decision is
the root of success.

Before you decide on a business career, consider
the worthy opportunity offered by the S. S. Kresge
Company to ambitious college men.

The Kresge Company is constantly adding new
stores to its list of more than 300, and for these
stores we need competent managers.

The only way to obtain satisfactory managers is to
engage young men possessing the necessary qual-
ities and give them a complete course of training
through the various positions in our stores.

By this method you learn the fundamentals of mer-
chandising and business in general—knowledge
that will prove a valuable asset to you in later years.
Write us without delay for full details.

After the dance
... a pipe
and P. A.

WHEN you’ve kicked off the pumps and tossed
the collar on the table, while the music is still
singing in your brain and memories of one
dancing deb in particular crowd your thoughts,
fill your pipe with Prince Albert and light up.
Make it a night of nights.

P. A. is so genuinely friendly. It hits your
smoke-spot in deep center right off the bat.
Doesn’t bite your tongue or parch your throat,
because the Prince Albert process said "nix on
the rough stuff” at the very beginning. Just
cool contentment in every perfect puff.

Don’t put off till tomorrow what you can
smoke today. Get a tidy red tin of P. A. now.
Snap back the hinged lid and release that won-
derful fragrance. Tamp a load into the bowl
of your jimmy-pipe and light up. Now you’ve
got it . . . that taste. Say—isn’t that the
goods now?
