WHAT OF
IT?

Kenney Laird, who was everything
but God’s representative on earth
(and might, under cover, have been
that) here at the unive^ity a couple
of years ago, was talking over that
shrine of the grade-pluggers—dear
old Phi Beta Kappa with me recently.
Mr. Laird is one of the Fee Beat
boys, having indeed been president
of Undergraduate Phi Beta Kappa
while in these halls. Hence, he is
well qualified to talk on the subject
And he did, both wisely and weil.

* * * *

The argument really began when
I expressed the opinion that the bovs
who get the key are not sucn a
noble lot, after all. Pithily I sketched
a picture of “these moles (I quote
from «memory) crawling out into the
light once in four years to get the
badge, and then crawling back, nev-
er to be heard of more.” There
were exceptions to the usual run, I
admitted,—fellows who were really
brilliant, who did not rely on sheer
grinding and sweating to get their
grades, men who were both human
and (because they were able to get
the key as they did) slightly divine.
Tochis type, I argued, conferring of
the Phi Beta Kappa key should be
confined.

• * *

Mr. Laird did not agree, and he
on his side, as I felt I on mine had
been, was entirely convincing. “There
should,” he said, “be some way of
rewarding, even of conferring dis-
tinction upon, such fellows as you
describe. They have done their
work conscientiously and thoroughly,
however dully, and in the end they
have arrived at excellence. To such
men the Phi Bete key is a fitting
symbol of achievement and of dis-
tinction. Many Phi Betes, too, are
not half bad fellows; I have known
many that exhibited human tend-
encies. Do you not agree?”

* * ♦ *

Kenny’s argument had the smack
of truth about it. And yet, in look-
ing back over years of.glorious Phi
Beta Kappa history, I could hardly
agree. How far from its original
aristocracy and exclusiveness had it
drifted! Founded December fifth,
1776, at William and Mary in Vir-
ginia by five 100 per cent blonde
Nordics and Virginia gentlemen, look
at it now’! How could any conscien-
tious Ku Kluxer bring himself to be-
long to it in its present day state?
What would those first members
think were they to rub elbows with
some of the current Phi Betes? The
old order passeth, indeed (this to be
declaimed in a voice of faint regret
and ineffable sadness), and always
cometh the new . . .

* * * *

The oldest college fraternity in
the country by fifty years, the first
secret society and selective fellow-
ship, where the the rigid bars to
the organization now? Gone with
the winds. And where, too, the se-
crets that any fraternity man must
ever grapple to his heart with hoops
of steel. Gone, gone, too. Phi Beta
Kappa—Philosophia Biou Kuberna-
tor!—not an unwashed scoundrel in
school but does know the motto car-
ried secret for years in the old sym-
bols. No secrets now!—no more
than the Reynolds Club or the St.
Mark’s Society.

♦ ♦ ♦ *

There is something terrible in the
decline and fall of this fore-runner
of all fraternities. Somehow, I can-
not but feel that those five original
members are walking the golden
streets of heaven crushed and brok-
en men. The original perversion of
the society from one of fellowship
to one for grinds was bad enough.
But the present Phi Bete type—that
must be the final blow.

The Hurrican Kid
Well— Watch Diet

Comes news that the Hurricane
Kid is eating once a week.

No, no, folks—be yourselves.
The H. K. is no long-distance
hunger-striker, not even a camel.
He—or she— i« the very radiant
alligator that the Florida team
bequeathed to Captain Marks
when they met around these parts
some few days ago. And instead
of -donning the good old nose bag
once every fortnight, the Kid will
feed once a week, on strict diet-
ary orders from sundry physiolog-
ists from the Sigma Nu club-
house.

Not only that. “Instead of min-
nows,” declared Marks, between
passes, “the darling will have
chilled consomme, grilled aspara-
gus tips, and cherry brandy for
his repasts. We shall develop the
unmolested minnows into a lovely
aquarium, or something.”

PHOENIX BARES

CAMPUS EVILS

Out Today; Exposes
Guarded Secrets

All the long cherished secrets of
the Greek societies—their mildewed
intrigues—the wicked paths that have
been trod in fraternity history—all
this is an open book. No longer will
unwitting high school graduates blun-
der into the nets laid for them by
overwise students. At last a hero
has been found brave enough to defy
centuries of tradition.

The Phoenix today in its first ap-
pearance on campus this quarter will
brazenly charge everything from
fourth degree murder to homicide in
connection with its greeting to the
incoming freshman. In honor of the
yearlings the number is called the
“Green” Phoenix.

Rumor hath it that the Phoenix
office will open at 7:30 o’clock this
morning, to receive in appropriate
fashion, the beautiful women who
are expected to apply for positions
to sell the humor magazine.

Y. M. AND Y. W. WILL

MEET WITH N. U. IN

FALL FOR RETREAT

About sixteen members of the Y.
M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. cabinets
met in a joint session at luncheon
this noon at Ida Noyes hall. At this
meeting tentative plans were laid
for a retreat with the joint cabinets
of Northwestern University some
time in December. A committee was
appointed to carry on negotiations
with the Northwestern cabinets. The
purpose of such a retreat would be

University Press Releases Final

Book of Former Pres. Burton

Former President Ernest DeWitt
Burton, collaborateed shortly before
his death with Harold R. Willoughby,
instructor in New Testament Litera-
ture in the University, in writing “A
Short Introduction to the Gospels,”
the revised edition of which has just
been released from the University
Press. New material from Dr. Bur-
ton’s files regarding the dates of the
Synoptic Gospels and a theory con-
cerning the composition of the
Fourth Gospel has been added to the
book.

Another book of interest, “Chris-
tianity in th Modern World” by For-
mer President Burton will be re-
leased to the public in December.
Profs. Willoughby and Edgar Good-
speed, editors of the book, have com-
piled the most important of the
speeches of Dr. Burton into one book.
Titles which give an insight into the
literary content are: “Why I Am
Content To Be a Christian,” “The

FITZGERALD TO

BUnON SALES

Former Interscholastic Rush
Chairman Leads

Campaign

Catherine Fitzgerald, chairman of
the women’s rushing division of last
year’s Interscholastic commission, has
been appointed to manage the sale
of the “Go Chicago” buttons at the
pep session preceding the Northwes-
tern game.

The sale is an annual affair con-
ducted by Iron Mask, Junior honor-
ary society, to arouse the enthusiasm
of the student body to the highest
pitch and to enhance school con-
sciousness among the fans that will
follow the team to the Evanston cam-
pus the following day. .

To Organize Women

Miss Fitzgerald will select in the
very near future at least ten of the
most prominent women pledges on

campus to form her group of sales-
women. On the evening of the pep
gathering, these saleswomen will ap-
proach all those attending and ex-
change a button for a twenty-five
cent piece.

Over seven hundred and fifty but-
tons were sold preceding the Illinois
game of last year and one thousand
are ordered for the sale this year, as
the demand exceeded the supply.

List Activities

Miss Fitzgerald, chairman of the
costume committee for the ensuing
Mirror production, was secretary of
the Sophomore class of last year, a
member of Sign of the Sickle, Soph-
more honorary society for women,
and a member of Mortar Board.

Walt Williamson
To Preside Over
Periodical Board

Walter G. Williamson, Managing
Editor of The Daily Maroon, was
elected president of the Board of
Student Publications at a meeting
held yesterday at 1 o’clock in the
office of Mr. Frank O’Hara. As
president of the board Mr. William-
son will preside at all meetings of
the board and will also sit on the
Undergraduate Council as a represen-
tative of the university publications.
Dermott McGraw, business manager
of the Cap and Gown was elected
secretary of the board. The meet-
ing held yesterday was an^aftermath
of a meeting held last June when the
members of the board were unable to
agree as to whom they wanted to
elect. *

Personal Religion of Jesus,” “The
Need for an Educated Ministry,”
“The Challenge of the Present to
American Christianity” and “Ought
the United States to be a Missionary
Nation?”

The book concludes with “Chris-
tian Education in China,” the last
public address n|ide by Dr. Burton.

In the Department of Theology
and Religion are two important new
books, “The Formation of the New
Testament” by Edgar J. Goodspeed,
Prof, of Biblical and Patristic Greek
and “The Psalms,” translated from
the Hebrew, by J. M. Powis Smith,
professor of Old Testament, Lan-
guages and Literature. The former
deals with the geographical facts
which influenced the assembling of
the books of the Testament; the lat-
ter is as near a copy of the original
Hebrew as possible, although correc-
tions have been made where the
sense was manifestly wrong.

Five Thousand Hot

Dogs for Maryland

Robert Hilton, undergraduate
concessionaire in charge of the
red hot stands at the University
stadium this year, says that his
stands must sell five thousand red
hots per game to pay their way.
As one of the stands sold thirteen
hundred at the Ohio State game
last year, Hilton is not particularly
concerned over the matter.

He also runs the stands at
Northwestern, and says that none
but the best of materials will be
used in the delicacies his under-
lings are to dispense this year.
Hilton concluded his statement
by saying that on the whole the
chances were that business would
be pretty good this fall. Every-
body knows what a dog tastes like
at the half on a cold day!

GET GREEN CAP
TICKETS TODAY

Decree Fee Must Be Paid in
Advance

Tickets for the second noon day
luncheon of the Green Cap Club, to
be held Monday, October 11, in the
Disciples of Christ Church, may be
obtained from Robert Harmon, Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity house.

Mr. Harmon urges that all frat-
ernities, who are desirious of having
their pledges make the club, should
call for tickets before Friday noon
with their money. A maximum of
only five tickets will be alloted to
each fraternity. For non-fraternity
men there have been tickets reserved,
which can be obtained at the candy
counter in Reynolds.

One of the requisites to member-
ship in the Green Cap Club is attend-
ance at the series of four weekly
luncheons, the first of which was giv-
en last Monday. Since many men
were turned away at the last ban-
quet for want of tickets the board
of directors advise Freshmen to get
their tickets as soon possible.

CLASSICSUBRARY

BUYS NEW BOOKS
FOR STUDENT USE

Valuable additions were made to
the books in Classics library during
the summer, according to Mr, Rathke,
librarian. All sections of the library
have been supplemented.

An eleven volume set of Hindu
tales called “The Ocean of Story” is
deemed the most interesting of the
new acquisitions. The collection was
translated directly from the Hindu.

Unusually beautiful woodcuts are
to be found in a new art folio by
Giesberg, says Mr. Rathke. The trea-
tise is on “German Woodcuts of the
Sixteenth Century.”

LONDON'S LORD BISHOP
CHAMPIONS GOSPEL OF

CHRISTIAN IN MANDEL

Versatile Philanthropist
Is Second Great

British Guest

By Milton S. Mayer

One Englishman blew in upon this
our campus wearing a double-breast-
ed suit. Another Englishman graced
the quadrangles adorned by the Mi-
tre and Cope. Both have left their
everlasting mark on our Gothic tow-
ers as no American has ever done.

Perhaps it is the enchanting dis-
tance of an ocean, perhaps the exotic
history of another world, the Old
World, that exalts them in our eyes.
Perhaps they are truly great. But
there is none to deny that Albert
Edward Windsor, Heir Apparent to
the throne of Great Britain, and Ar-
thur Foley Winnington Ingram, High
Churchman and Lord Bishop of Lon-
don, are the real representatives.

The Right Reverend Winnington
Ingram, second Britisher to stretch
his hands across the sea, was born in
Worcestershire, England, January,
26, 1853. Educated at Marlborough
and Keeble Colleges, Oxford, the
clergyman’s brilliant career has
found him a private tutor; private
chaplain to the Bishop of Lichfield,
head of Oxford House, Bethnal
Green, rural dean of Spitalfields, can-
on of St. Paul’s Cathedral, Bishop
of Stepney, and ultimately Lord Bis-
hop of London, which seat he has
held for twenty-five years.

Two Englishmen, power of the
state, power of the church,—and all
America kneels in reverence. What’s
the answer?

Publish Book On

American Life By

Recent Graduate

Another University graduate, Eliz-
abeth Madox Roberts ’21, has recent-
ly come to fame through the publica-
tion of the novel, “The Time of
Man.” Prof. Robert Morss Lovett,
of the English department, gives the
book a complimentary review in the
New Republic magazine comparing it (
with Willa Cather’s “My Antonia”
and other popular American fiction.

Miss Roberts received her Ph. B.
degree at the University in 1921.
While in the University she worked
under the supervision of Prof. Lov-
ett. She was a member of the Poet-
ry club, and took an active interest
in the life of the University. Her
first literary contribution was a group
of collected poems, “Under the
Tree,” published by Huebsch of New
York.

UNIVERSITY M. S.

STUDENTS RECEIVE

ARMY COMMISSIONS

Twenty-four members of the Uni-
versity of Chicago Reserve Officers’
Training Corps received commissions
as second lieutenants in the f ield
Artillery Reserve of the U. S. Army
during the past year. Work pursued
in the Department of Military Sci-
ence and Tactics concurrently with
their other subjects earned them the
commissions from the Secretary of
War. The twenty-four new officers
of the Army represent a considerable
increase in the number of commis-
sions earned during 1925-1926 over
those in any previous year.

George M. Christler, now a stu-
dent in Rush Medical College, was
declared honor graduate of the R.
O. T. C. unit. ’ Chrisler, who starred
three years in polo and was captain
of the polo team last spring, earned
the distinction through soldierly
qualities and academic proficiency.

To Comment On Our
Universities After

Eastern Tour

By Bee Jay Green

“Take with both hands the Sword
of Goliath, walk straight ahead and
shadows will always be behind you,”
Right Reverend Winnington Ingram,
Lord Bishop of London, declared yes-
terday evening in Mandel Hall, in
making what he termed a Christian
appeal to the Universities of Amer-
ica. <

The fear of death, the fear of un-
forgiven sins, the fear of haunting
temptations, the doubt of creed, and
depression of spirit are the great
corses of man the Lord Bishop main-
tained. The Sword of Goliath breaks
these curses, with it man, can see
sunshine and light, without it he is
g;loomy, depressed and spreads his
cheerlessness.

In comparing other great religious
cults with Christianity, Lord Bishop
Ingram said that Mohammedans must
change their whole philosophy about
women before they could aid the
world, that Buddhism was beautiful,
but there was no God there, and that
Christian Science was a religion for
the rich, not the poor.

Appealing to the youth of America
to grasp the word of Jesus, he heark-
ened back to the days of the World
War days which he reminded his au-
dience were full of temptations, and
claimed that those who remained
straight during the war were in exact
proportion to those who adhered to
prayer.

“In a large city like Chicago,” he
said, “there are many temptations,
but if he holds the Swor dof Goli-
ath, the youth will always be
straight.”

Lord Bishop Ingram has already
spoken in Ames, Iowa, and at the
University of Illinois, and will con-
tinue his tour to Detroit, Boston,
New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Washington an,d Sewanee, Tenn.

His tour is being made at the re-
quest of the clergy of America, for
the purpose of making the Christian

New Work Is Clear, Simple

There comes a time in the life of
nearly every college student when he
asks himself the question, “what is
it all about?”—what is the meaning
of everything, or is there any mean-
ing? the world and his own life—
whence do they originate and whith-
er do they tend? God, freedom and
immortality—are they sublime truths
or empty illusions?

AWARD TO BE GIVEN
BEST FRESHMAN IN

ADVERTISING DEPT.

The cut is a reproduction of the
cup that is offered to the freshman
aspirant for the business staff who
scores most points in the ad contest
sponsored by The Daily Maroon.
This contest is based upon the
amount of advertising sold, the in-
terest shown in the individual’s work

। stories around Andy Protheroe “dean
of lounge lizards” at the University
of Illinois, and again the veil of dis-
guise is thinnly drawn, around both
characters and places.

Stories of college life, judging
from the number obtainable at Clas-
sic’s rental, ranging from good to
not so good, seem popular of late.
“Maroon Tales” by Cuppy, giving a
picture of the early days of the Uni-
versity, “Grey Toners’ ’of 1923, and
“Chimes” by Herrick, are the only
stories of life at the Universtiy, over
against innumerable tales of other
universities and colleges, east and
west. Some of the better known
college stories are: “Fidelia” by Ed-
win Balmer of Northwestern, the
previously much discussed “Plastic
Age” by Percy Marks, and the some-
what poorly done presentation of life
at Dartmouth, “Granite,” by Quinn.

OPEN NEW MODISTE
STORE FOR WOMEN
IN CAMPUS DISTRICT

Yesterday Miss Elise A. Runyan
threw open to the women of the
Hyde Park district the doors of her
new frock shop at 1571 E. Fifty-third
St. Tea was served in the cream-
colored salon amid many flowers.
Miss Runyan was hostess to about
five hundred guests.

Miss Runyan and her models will
continue as she has done in the past
three years to cater to conservative
well-dressed women. Her frocks are
copies of Paris creations no two of
which are alike. Miss Runyan as-
sures all University women of per-
sonal service. The shop, though ex-
clusive in personel, is within the
reach of any University woman who
is fastidious in her choice of clothes.

To such as these Will Durant’s
story of Philosophy will come as a
godsend. It is perhaps the best in-
troduction to philosophy ever writ-
ten. Some courage is required thus
to praise a book which so quickly has
become a best-seller, but in this case,
as Oscar Wilde would say, the pub-
lic has achieved a success. Dewey’s
statement of the essence of Durant’s
accomplishment can hardly be bet-
tered: “he has humanized rather
than merely popularized the story
of philosophy.”

W’HOLLY by coincidence three items appeared on the front page
of yesterday’s Daily Maroon which had a more than passing sig-
nificance. These items reported events which were in themselves
of little importance; but the trend which they record is of vital im-
portance.

One item was an account of the abandonment of compulsory
chapel at Yale University. The second reported the decision of the
local administration to allow students to continue operating auto-
mobiles. The third announced the capitulation of the Reynolds
Club authorities in the matter of selling cigarettes.

The trend which these items indicate is indisputably in the di-
rection of student liberty. Our university, and other enlightened uni-
versities continue to remove the restrictions which are a holdover
from the period when universities were mere academies, with the
president speeding the graduates on their various way with a course
on moral philosophy.

The Daily Maroon stands unequivocally for student liberty. Its
editors have unlimited faith in the intelligence and the responsibility
of university students. They believe that those university adminis-
trations are best which interfere least with the personal lives of stu-
dents and which encourage most the genuine sense of responsibility
which is latent in every student of university age.

There is always the objection that the average student will not
work unless he is forced. It is true, unfortunately, that such a con-
dition prevails in American secondary schools, and that such an at-
titude is carried on into the universities. The task of breaking
through this attitude and building up a tradition of student initiative,
in studies as well as in the conduct of life, is not an easy one. Neither
is it impossible.

The University of Chicago has been notably progressive in its
attitude toward student liberty. It prefers to regard its constituents
as serious minded, level-headed, intelligent men and women. The
Daily Maroon subscribes unanimously to this attitude, and to the the-
ory that lies behind it.

odate the usual morning rush for coffee and waffles; the regular
noon demand for malted milks and the incessant afternoon demand
for hot chocolate and wafers. And then the doors will close and
the demand will seek other channels for satiation.

There is no place on, or near, the campus where University
men and women can spend a quiet hour in stimulating conversation
of an evening. There are not many men who can sit over ten min-
utes in the reception room of girl’s halls. Somehow the halls reek
with femininity.

And so being of a discursive nature they seek the night clubs
for campus “small talk.” The Coffee Shop could well fill this void;
economically for the student-; profitably for itself and satisfactorily
for all.

“Let’s go to the Coffee Shop.”

Language Is Clear

The outstanding feature of the
book is its presentation of the most
abstruce and subtle doctrines in lan-
guage that is clear, simple, and at-
tractive. The work is almost as
easy to read as any well written nov-
el, yet the author has rarely done
wrong to the essential meaning of
any of his philosophers. The secret
lies partially in his gusto and bold-
ness. He is not an original thinker
but he is an independent one. There
is nothing of the pedant about him,
no tendency to lose the forest in the
trees. He gives the impression that
he is a lover of philosophy who has
absorbed the teachings of its various
schools so thoroughly that he can
easily reproduce them in his own
language, infusing into it the pas-
sionate delight of his studies and at
the same time criticizing it with a
freedom and irreverence bred of lon£
familiarity. He knows, too, when to
quote. The numerous passages which
he selects from his philosophers are
invariably well chose, interesting in
themselves and typical of their writ-
ers. Lastly he has the gift of re-
partee. His book abounds in epi-
grams, usually clever although some-
times superficial and occasionally
sinking into cheap witticism, but al-
ways summarizing curtly a definite
point of view:

and the general attitude of the con-
testant about the office. The name
of the winner will be engraved on
the cup, and it will remain in his
possession for the entire winter
quarter. Another incentive in the
business department lies in the fact
that four of these new students will
be retained for sophomore positions.
Each ad seeker will also receive a
commission on all the ads he sells.

Another merit but one almost
merging into a defect in this connec-

The philosophers who march through
his volume from Plato to Dewey are
one and all made living figures, with
characteristic strides or struts, with
beating hearts as well as active
brains. They are, most essentially,
human beings in a human environ-

FRESHMEN GRIDDERS GAIN GROUND WITH MARYLAND PLAYS

YEARLINGS HURL

EASTERN ATTACK

AT VARSITY LINE

Crisler In Frosh Lineup
To Test Maroon

Mixtures of Maryland and Penn
plays were again hurled at the var-
sity linesmen last night by the quite
expert freshman. The same decep-
tive tactics that gained ground dur-
ing the Tuesday practice continued
to trouble the Maroon regulars.

Burgess, member of the Notre
Dame freshman last year, and Men-
denhall assumed the ball-carrying
and tossing for the frosh and they
did both in highly commendable fash-
ion. Passes and line plunges gained
considerable grpundage for the first
year men. Fritz Crisler took an ac-
tive position on his frosh team lead-
ing the assault on the varsity line.

Stagg gave his first string backs
signal and play practice. They were
not exposed to scrimmage. From in-
dications it iS almost certain that
Stagg will continue the open tactics
which he introduced in'the Florida
game.

Weislow’s work at tackle is up to
the high standard he set last Satur-
day. Apitz and Spence will again
probably start at the end jobs. There
is keen competition for the guard
berths with Wolff showing the most
stuff. K. Rouse is sure to start at
the pivot position.

The same backfield that opened
against Florida seems likely to take
the field against Maryland.

Heavy Ticket Sale

For Maryland Game

Advance ticket sales for the
Maroon-Maryland football game
Saturday point to an unusual
crowd for such a game. The foot-
ball tickets committee predicts an
attendance of 35,000 exceeding
that of the Florida game last Sat-
urday by 4,000.

Student applications for the last
three games of the season, Illinois,
Northwestern, and Wisconsin are
coming in rapidly, and a sellout
for these games is certain. Atten-
tioh is called to the fact that those
holding student C books may pur-
chase tickets for the Northwest-
ern game at the reduced rate of
one dollar.

OPEN BIG I-M

NON-FRAT DRIVE

An organized drive in the dormit-
ories, clubs and physical education
classes will be held in a few days for
the purpose of getting more non-
fraternity men into intramural ath-
letics. Not enough interest has yet
been shown by the non Greeks, and
it is to stimulate interest and rivalry
that this drive is to be started.

Leagues are to be formed in the
graduate schools also. If enough
teams enter from the graduate law,
divinity, Chicago Theological Semin-
ary, C. and A., and medical schools
each department will have its own
league, and separate prizes will be
offered to league winners.

GYM TEAM GETS
EARLY SEASON

PRACTICE START

Coach Hoffer Has Four
Veterans As Nucleus

For New Team

There was a keen glint in the eyes
of Coach Dan Hoffer as he walked
over the gym floor yesterday after-
noon. And well such a thing might
be as yesterday saw teh start of the
gym team’s practice for this year’s
campaign. His able corps of nimble
athletes were “all present” with a
new freshness for the rigorous prac.
tice before them and an eagerness to
“do their stuff.”

Both Hoffer and his team are de-
termined to equal their brilliant rec-
ord of last year but the going will
again be tough. Two intersectional
clashes with Penn and the Navy are
the high lights in the season’s sched-
ule.

Four Letter Men

Four letter men remain to bolster
up the squad and carry the team
through to victory again. Captain
Davidson, Jimmy Flexner, last year’s
runner up for the undivided national
championship* Jerry Quinn, last
year’s captain, will again form a
promising nucleus around which Hof-
fer can develop . a well balanced
squad. But there are plenty of open-
ings on the team and all who come
out are promised the superlatively
capable tutelage of toach Hoffer.

The second of December has been
set as the day for the meetings of
the Conference coaches to make up
the schedule.

Athletic Department Expands— To
Take Over “Y.M.,f Bowling Alley

Pre-Season Cage
Practice Now On

Coach Nels Norgren has issued
a call for pre-season basketball
practice. The practice is to be
daily at 2:15 starting today. Can-
didates for the varsity are to
scrimmage with the best class
teams in Norgren’s physical educa-
tion classes. This early practice
is headed by Captain Sackett, and
includes such able players as Fer-
well, Macklin, Gist, McConnell and
Kaplan.

Wisconsin Sends
All Teams Here

A crimson-clad horde will invade
the campus cf the university this
year when the University of Wis-
consin comes here to play on Stagg
Field on November 20. The Badger
Athletic Department is sending its
entire Freshman squad here on that
date along with all of the substitutes
and the regular team. To defray
the expense of sending so many men
to Chicago, teh University of Wis-
consin Athletic Department is print-
ing and selling programs at the two
non-conference games played by the
Badgers this fall.

No Student Complete Without a Typewriter

If the opportunities for exercise
which the athletic department pro-
vides for Chicago students were made
use of by all, the student body here
would undoubtedly be one of the
healthiest university groups in the
country. The department, under
Lonnie Stagg, has just announced
the culmination of another one of
its numerous projects —the taking
over of the Y. M. C. A. bowling al-
leys located in Reynolds Club.

The Department of Athletics will
have complete supervision over the
ever popular alleys which are in Man-
del basement and Bill King has been
given the place of student manager.
No expense is to be spared and the
finest of equipment is to be placed
on the alleys for the students. New
mats will be put down and new pins
set up, while all of the old appara-
tus will be refurbished.

The alleys will open officially on
Monday, but free bowling will be
offered if they are ready for service
before then. After that the same
prices that were formerly charged
by the ‘Y’ will be in order.

The new management will offer
the best of co-operation the Intra-
murals tournaments and will great-
ly speed up the play. As increased
interest by the participants is also
expected special and individual
matches will also be fostered and
many new features are to be added.

Duval and Kelly Ineligible;
Take Old Places In

Frosh Ranks

One of the most promising squads
of freshmen football candidates seen
on the Midway in some time, seems
to be the verdict of experienced ob-
servers after watching the ’30 team
in action.

Among those present are Pat Kel-
ly, Chuck Duval, both of whom ran
afoul ineligibility snags. The former
made an excellent impression on the
freshmen coaches last Fall, while
Duval’s work is well known to the
Maroon followers.

ON SCHOOL
Dear Turk:

If the remarks
stern, Miguel and

PATRIOTISM

made by Morgen-
others concerning

the team’s singing were supposed to
be funny, one surely must admit that
some U. of C. students have a pe-
culiar sense of humor.

—Hero-Worshipper.

THERE you are! The indignant
voice of the people swells out once
more in defense of our gallant Var-
sity. Last year there was almost a
riot in the Maroon office because of
alleged slights against’our team. It’s

hard t# understand all this. If
were to attack the University’s
ministration, as has been done
others before, there wouldn’t be
slightest ripple of undergraduate

we
ad-

by
the
in-

dignation. Maybe the profs aren’t
good looking enough. With absolute
impunity, our baseball team may be
dragged over the coals, our chapel
program criticised, our Law school
kidded. But with the slightest mur-
mur against the graet god Football,
scores of “loyal U. of C. students”
will cluster frothy-mouthed about the
gates of the Daily Maroon a-crying
for editorial blood and tearful apol-
ogies.

All of which goes to prove that
we now won’t be able to follow Jack
“Dopey” Oppenheim’s advice and
tell you about the scheduled plans for
a post-season game with the Har-
vard glee club.

YOU ASKED ME FOR A POEM

You asked me for a poem one night,
With subtle words to prey

Upon your soul and by their might
Entice your heart away.

My words were wan, and now it
seems

We’ve drifted far apart.

1 have the poem in my dreams . . .

And you have still your heart.
