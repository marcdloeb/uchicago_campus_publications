Thirty-one leaders in undergraduate

to “rush" the place winners in the
1926 World’s Greatest Interscholastic.

The following are the men chosen
by the General Rushing committee
under the chairmanship of Bert Mc-
Kinney: Frank Gowdy, Fred Hob-
scheid, James Cusack, Anton Burg,

McKinney Explains Choice

"These men have been chosen as
representative Chicago undergradu-
ates,” said McKinney, “and because
they have shown marked ability in
campus activities. Their job will be to
get the men who place in each event
immediately after the event has been
run. They will take these men into
their hands and shoulder the responsi-
bility of persuading them to return to
Chicago.

“This is just is just one cog in the
rushing machine that we hope will
cover every possibility that comes to
the meet.”

Fraternity representatives recently
named by the executive committee are
asked to report by June 4 how many
of the visiting men intend to
join the trip around campus on June 4
and how many wis|j to make the tour
of the city the following day.

Mulroy to Broadcast

Tom Mulroy, student
the meet, is scheduled
over WLS this evening,
plain the purposes of an



manager of
to broadcast
He will ex-
Interscholas-

tic and try to interest the general pub-
lic not only in the meet itself but in
amateur athletics generally.

“Everything is being done to insure
an epoch in Interscholastic history,”
said Mulroy last night. “We have
added to the various staffs and com-
mittees men whose connections extend
throughout the country in order that
the meet may not be confined to the
quadrangles but will reach every cor-
ner of the nation.”

With the rapidly increasing number
of team acceptances the housing com-
mittee finds itself confronted with a
real problem. Every possible location
on campus will be utilized, according
' to John Gerhart, housing chairman,
and the athletes should enjoy a com-
fortable stay.

A total of 700 entries from eighty
schools, sending 215 men is the record
to date of the entry blanks received
from prep men in over twenty-five
states. Officials of the meet predict
that from all of the early indications,
the twenty-second National meet will
far exceed all previous meets in both
the number of men participating, and
in the caliber of the men entered.

The Cap and Gown will make its
appearance on campus next Tuesday.
Salesdesks are to be placed at Wood-
worth’s Bookstore, University Book-
store, the Law Library, Commerce
and Administration building, Reynolds

club and Ida Noyes hall. The
for the book is set at $5.

Printers have been working in
tinuous shifts in order to put the

price

con-
book

out for next Tuesday. This was nec-
essary because a large part of the ma-
terial was destroyed on the way to the
binders by the storm last Tuesday
which overturned a truck carrying ten
forms.

This issue of the Cap and Gown
has been enlarged considerably over
those of former years. One of the
leading features of the book is the ex-
cellent art work by James Root and his
staff.

RUSHING COMMITTEE
NAMES JUNE THIRD
AS TRACK TAG DAY

“Wear a tag and boost the Inter-
scholastic,” will be the universal cam-
pus cry on June 3, the official tag
day to arouse interest in the World’s
Greatest Interscholastic Track meet.
Fifty women, representatives from the
women’s clubs and organizations have
been appointed by the Women’s Rush-
ing committee to distribute the tags,
and will be stationed at various places
on campus. Tags will be given out
to all students free of charge, to ad-
vertise the Interscholastic.

This is the earliest Interscholastic
activity in which the women on cam-
pus may participate and according to
Catherine Fitzgerald, chairman of the
Committee, with the cooperation of
the women selected the tag day should
be successful in arousing interest and
enthusiasm for the Fep Session to be
held Thursday night at 7 in Mandel

hall. Tag day will be followed by
Senior Vaudeville on Friday night.
Saturday night the presentation
Awards will take place, followed

the
On
of
by

the Moonlight Dance in Hutchinson
Court. Women’s clubs and organiza-
tions have taken boxes for both
nights.

Dr. Ben L. Reitman, head of the Chi-
cago Hobo College, exposed his opin-
ions on Poverty and Murder; opinions
that in the past resulted in his being
blacklisted by the leading daily pa-
pers of Chicago.

“There are no more poor in the
Christian world,” asserted Dr. Reit-
man. “No longer do communities
starve with no one to lend a helping
hand. Our charitable organizations
and our governmental doles and pen-
sions have eliminated the terrible pri-
vation and suffering that the poor en-
dured three hundred years ago.” And
having cleaned up this subject with a
sweep of the hand and a toss of his
curly, tousled head, the ponderous
orator placed his arms akimbo on his
hips and drew his already short trous-
ers up over the tops of his frowsy
socks.

“Twenty-five percent of the murders
committed in America today,” he con-
tinued, “are committed by the police
and not by bloodthirsty criminals as it
is popularly supposed today. Out of
441 murders in the city of Chicago
in 1923. 35 were the acts of the crim-
inal classes. The others were commit-
ted in the name of safety first. For-
eign countries do not equip their police
forces with pistols and machine guns

Outline Tentative Curriculum
Of New Graduate
Department

Professional and general cultural
courses will be included in the curri-
culum of the graduate library school
established at the University by a
gift of $1,385,000 from the Carnegie
Corporation, according to a tentative
outline of courses. The school will
emphasize the broad principles of li-
brary work and its relation to society
as well as technical fundamentals.

It is planned to offer courses in li-
brary architecture and building prob-
lems, filing methods, library admin-
istration, relation of library to city or

THE LIVING BURTON

“PRESIDENT ERNEST DEWITT BURTON is dead.”

1 A year ago today that message spread over the United
States and the world; and Chicagoans bowed their heads. His great
Development Campaign was only begun; but he was gone. “Now,”
said The Daily Maroon, “with the walls and towers of President
Burton’s dream-university gradually materializing in real brick and
stone and mortar, the Arichitect himself is taken away, and the work
is left half-completed without the master’s hand to bring it to ful-
fillment.”

But the work continued. President Burton had begun a pro-
gram not destined to end with his death. Buildings—more and more
of them—have risen steadily. The Theology building is completed
and in use; the Bond chapel is almost finished; work has started on
the University chapel; a School of Medicine is startling the Midway
with its rapid rise. The branches and departments of the University
have grown. A new school (for the study of library science—one of
President Burton’s special fields of service to the University) has
just been founded.

The work will continue. Other builders have taken up the task.
Because President Burton planned a greater and more useful Uni-
versity of Chicago and because he organized and led a campaign
for the fulfillment of that plan, Chicago still grows, and still strives
to achieve President Burton’s dream.

The circus has nothing on us when it comes to "the lure

It is only fair to give next fall’s books the same start

the Intferclass hop will take pllace
on Friday night.

Spring colors and spring-like decor-
ations will be the dominant note of the
evening, and the prom leaders have
planned to carry it out in their cus-
toms. Alta Cundy, who will lead the
Senior wing with Graham Hagey, has
chosen a gown of white lace for the
occasion. Betty Graham, junior, who
will be Parker Hall’s partner will wear
pink and green chiffon. John McDon-
ough and Betsy Farwell will represent
the sophomore class, Miss Farwell
wearing a gown of blue chiffon. Char-
lotte Eckhart, who with Harry Hagey
will lead the freshman wing, will be
in pink chiffon and silver lace.

Among other events scheduled Fri-

Give House Dances

Saturday night will be a favored
date for many spring dances. Chi
Psi has issued invitations for a house
dance on that evening. Kappa Nu
will entertain at a formal dance, to be
held at the Belmont hotel. Tau Delta
Phi announces a house dance at which
Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Blink are to be
guests of honor for the occasion. Sig-

WHAT of IT?

^CtOagE MORfENSTER^

1 am coming to be convinced that
the Alpha Delt house is no place for
any dog looking for three meals and
a box to sleep in to present himself.
This conviction is the result of actual
experience in the case of two animals,
and of hearsay in several other in-
stances. When what passed as a Scotch
terrier, one Sam Eeels, disappeared
after two days’ residence some few
weeks ago, I reported the fact in this
column, together with such attendant
circumstances as seemed pertinent.
Now. when another beast, Sam Eeels
II, disappears after another two days’
sojourn, I am tempted to make such
a generalization as leads off this col-
umn.

The dog Sam II was found rambling
about the street early Saturday morn-
ing by that prominent Irish statesman,
Mr. Pat Kelly, and brought along to
the lodge (note the Hagey influence
there) by the same Kelly. After get-
ting the animal, said to be the mak-
ings of a black and white shepherd dog
safely within doors, Mr. Kelly was ob-
served to proceed to the bathroom,
lather the animal with Palmolive, and
tub him. This, it might be noted, was
reported by Elliot Fulton, the lodge
chairman, to be the first time on record
on which Mr. Kelly fulfilled his Satur-
day morning requirements.

These ideas were fresh in my mind
when I took myself home to Oak Park-
Saturday night. They were still rea-
sonably fresh when I returned here
the next evening. I looked for Sam.
He was nowhere about. He was not
in the kitchen, not on the sofa, not on
my bed; indeed, he was not within
sight. I recalled the episode of Sam
the First. I felt distinctly uneasy.
“Mrs. Halliwell,” I asked the house-
keeper, with a sinking feeling in my
stomach, “where is Sam?” “Huh!”’
said that cheery old soul, “think I’m
going to have any dogs around—any
dog’s as’ll eat pork chops on the liv-
ing room carpet? I guess not! That
dog’s gone away from here, ami gone
for good.” And, it developed, Sam
had.

So, much as I regret to do it, I
must warn all stray pups to stay away
from 5747 University, unless, like my
old spaniel, Abe Mitchell Zip, they
know Mrs. Price-Post both ways from
the covers.

LOCALS HOPE TO

REPEAT VICTORY

OF FIRST GAME

Indians Now in 2nd Place
Out to Avenge Former
Defeat

Norgren and the Maroon ball team
are in Champaign today with one fixed
purpose and aim—to administer to Il-
linois and the Lundgren team a very
decisive beating. The previous victory
of the Norgrenite’s, now holding sev-
enth place in the Big Ten ranking,
still rankles in the hearts of the In-
dians, who happen to be in second
place. The Indians also have the very
fixed purpose of handing the invaders
a decisive defeat—but, in addition to
raising Chicago a notch in the confer-
ence race to a victory over the strong
Illini will bring a lot of added prestige

No Outside Teams

In Big Ten Meet

For the first time in history, there
will be no outside teams in the Big
Ten Track meet this spring. The
athletic directors voted to make the
meet a closed affair to Conference
teams. Not since 1913 has an out-
side team won the meet. California
won it once, as did Missouri, and
one year Leland Stanford and Notre
Dame tied for first place, but in
twenty-two out of twenty-five years
a Big Ten team won the title. The
reason given for the barring of out-
side teams was that their entry
clouded the championship of Con-
ference, for they scored just
enough points to make the issue be-
tween the leading Big Ten teams a
bit vague. Notre Dame, Missouri.

Capt. Gubbins who pitched real

game and who still is in the same
top form will do the pitching for Nor-

probably be the same as it has been
in the last few games.

ILLINI SPORT YEAR
CLOSES THIS WEEK
WITH MAROON GAME

Urbana, 111., May 25.—Ten baseball
players, members of the senior class
of the University of Illinois, will play
their last games for the Illini this week
when they meet Chicago and Minne-
sota in the final wind-up of the 1925-
26 season. The ten men are—Capt.
Jerr Jordan, Clinton; Joe Barta,
Algonquin; John S. Ludlam, Knox-
ville, Pa.; C. F. Major, Champaign;
James O’Keefe, Allentown, Pa.; Floyd
S. Stahl, Grover Hill, O.; Alex Nem-
kovsky, J. C. Worth, Ralph Margolis
and D. A. Bissell, Chicago.

The strong Chicago team, already
credited with one victory over the Il-
lini, will invade Illinois field Wednes-
day, May 27. The Illini are anxious
to wind up the seasnn with a couple of
impressive wins and Coach Carl L.

NETMEN PREPARE

FOR CONFERENCE

Meet Here Thursday To
Saturday

Racqueteers from all points within
bounds of the Big Ten Conference
will be seen at the campus on the 27,
28 and 29 of this month. All but one
of the ten universities in the confer-
ence are to participate, Indiana not
entering a team this year.

Chicago will enter its stars, Captain
Wallie Schaefer, and H. Shapinsky,
the latter playing first man. Parker
Hall, Hudlin, Drain, Marumotto, Ben-
nett are the other men who will take
part in the clay court struggles.

Northwestern is sending two entries
of considerable strength in John Phil-
lips and William Sherrill. Lutz and
Swartz are without doubt the outstand-
ing men upholding Iowa’s flag. Ed.
Seymour and Roger Tracy ranking
players of Ohio are to carry the gon-
fallon of Ohio State into the varsity
courts here, while Illinois boasts of
O’Connell, a former Hyde Parker.

This is the first time in many years
that the result of the tournament can
not be determinew, for competition
will be close although no exceptional
net men are to take part. The ineli-
gibility of George Lott has weakened
Chicago’s chances considerably.

highest honors Friday afternoon in the
season’s final which is to be the fea-

field.

Business-Like Games

Yesterday’s battles brought out the
best baseball to date when the Alpha
Delts snatched a sizzling 6-5 victory
from the Delta Sigma Phi and when
the Phi Pi Phi’s beat the Phi Sigma
Delta’s 3 to 1 only to lose 3 to 0
to the Kappa Nu aggregation.

The Alpha Delts lowered the colors
of the Delta Sigs principally through a
concentrated fourth inning attack
when four runs clattered across the
plate. The • losers started out as if
they were going to be something else
before the game was over when they
rushed in a trio of runs. Gaskill began
the business by poling out a hit and
his example was followed by Johnson
and Griffin. A passed ball aided, but
Reitan' rolled out to end the inning.
With two out in the fourth Francis
jogged to first on an error which
should have been the third out. Soc-
cessive and successful jabs by Alyea,
Kelly, Covert and Fox were converted
into a quartet of scores before the
round was over and the gong had
sounded. The winners scored once in
the sixth and in the seventh. Griffin

and Reitan started a rally for the Delta
Sigs in the last chapter but Covert
tightened up like a vise and the ball
game was over.

Kraft Works 2 Games

With Kraft hurling in sensational
style the Phi Pi’s grabbed a 3-1 victory
from the Phi Sigma Delta crew in

their first game of the afternoon,
ter the first inning Kraft permitted
two men to reach first base. The
Sigs began by counting their lone

Af-
but

bases in th/ sev-

Xu game Kraft ion-
work until the fourth

inning when he weakened and the Kap-
pa Nu’s found him for two runs which
were sufficiejit to win the battle.
The Kappa Nu’s didn’t show much of
an attack for the first three innings,
but they managed to secured two hits
to break the ice in the fourth. Kutner
led off with a good-for-one-base thrust
in this frame and proceeded to second
when an infielder threw the ball sky-
ward. Klaff flied out and Kutner got
to third on a passed ball. Stone, col-
orful shortstop for the Kappa Nu’s,
was walked, and promptly stole sec-
ond. Cohen struck out but Klaff and
Stone cooperated in a double steal
which terminated in the scoring of
two runs. Klaff, encouraged by Stone’s
hit, added a run for good measure in
the seventh.

What Is
A Life
Underwriter?

One who executesand delivers
a life insurance policy. In
other words, a person whose
business it is to offer the
known benefits of life insur-
ance to individuals, to corpor-
ations, to partnerships, etc.

But further, the life under-
writer is one who must con-
vince those clients of the
benefits offered. This means
stimulating contact with hu-
man character, and with large
affairs. Some underwriters
prefer the game of character
and deal mainly with indi-
viduals. Others prefer affairs;
to them is open the great field
of business insurance.

Furthermore, the business of
life underwriting pays highly
for initiative and ability.

And still more, the life under-
writer offers to his client a
commodity which has no risk
in it, does not deteriorate,and
adds no burden of mental
worry. The life underwriter
sells absolute security, the
foundationofserenityofmind.

It is worth while to think
these things over now and to
remember them when, per-
haps, you find yourself wrong-
ly placed in whatever business
you may have chosen.
