Indications—like the floating stick
Columbus saw—are beginning to drift
in to the conductor showing the lav
of the land with regard to the campus
attitude towards this column. All in
all, they have been rather more of a
source of amazement to me than any-
thing else. For it seems strenuous
objection not only to the subject mat-
ter of some of my blowings-off of
steam is being made in certain quar-
ters. but that even the treatment of
these same subjects has come up for
attack. I have been accused of lay-
ing profant hands on some of the most
sacred institutions of college life—
dear old Phi Beta Kappa, for instance.
The charge has been brought up that
I have treated serious and entirely re-
spectable subjects with undue levity.
The term “Red” has even been dug
out of the files of the New Republic
and The Nation and applied to me.

More than 200 Freshrtian aspir-

Cap Club tacked from six to ten
inches of bright green ribbon to
their Frosh caps this norning. The
first streamers appeared late yester-
day afternoon, when two members
of the class of 1920 sailed past The
Daily Maroon office in an open
Ford, with their colors flying after
them. Addition of streamers to the
caps is the first distinction that
Freshman in the race for Green Cap
Club membership have had on cam-
pus.

The situation, it it is not so already,
is rapidly becoming serious. | am
afraid that if it becomes much more
crucial, I may, like the late lamented
William McKinley, beforced to lay
down my life before the altar of mid-
dle-class respectability. For the boys
are beginning to buzz about my ears.
I am beleagued with indignant Phi
Betes; I am persecuted by indignant
club women; certain elements along
Fraternity Row and among Mr.
Stagg’s football team are looking to
their guns. On all sides, more or less
righteous wrath is kindling. Things
are. indeed, coming to a crux.

‘First Raters’ by

to Appear in Trib

It has never been my practice to
reveal trade secrets having to do with
the knocking off of this column. The
process has always been kept shroud-
ed in mystery. I fear the general
conception among the student body as
to the method it is done has to deal
with the devil coming out of a gin
bottle in a cloud of smoke every after-
noon and sitting himself down at the
t’-pewriter to assits me. This fancy
of mine, I might say, devolves from
the queer way in which the boys have
been receiving my assorted twisters.
I take great pains in stating that it
has actually no basis at all in fact. I
hope the boys will get me right on
‘’••s. and not go around saying I have
• dmitted myself to be in league with
the devil. Nothing could be farther
from the truth. I shall not be held
responsible for any untruths contract-
ed by the devil: I have enough of my
own to bother me.

The deadline for all manuscripts writ-
ten for Blackfriars will be the first of
December. After that time, no manu-
script of any sort will be considered.
This leaves slightly less than two months
in which to amass material -for the
Black friars’ production this year.

Any question arising as to the types
or kinds of manuscripts desired by the
Blackfriars, or any technicalities what-
soever. should be referred to Phil Wa-
trou at the Psi U house. Through
him any consultation wished with
Hamilton Coleman, the Blackfriars'
coach, will be arranged.

George L. Mulfinger. '23. who has

Berlin, will give his first piano re-

theater. ,

After having received his Ph. B.
from the University he studied abroad
under Emil von Sauer, and under’
Franz Schmidt, the Austrian compos-1
er. His compositions for piano and l
violin have attracted much attention.

with a record of failure. Senior

col-

lege students whose cuts exceed one

sixth of the scheduled recitations

are

not admitted to^the final examinations.

Compared to the system here where
cutting is entirely up to the jurisdic-
tion of the individual instructors, such
rigorous treatment seems harsh.

FIRST INTRAMURAL
HANDBOOK APPEARS

ON CAMPUS TODAY

The Intramural handbook for the
fall quarter is out today. This hand-
book as usual contains a bevy of gen-
eral information dealing with Intra-
mural athletics and is published by the
Intramural personnel. The annual
calendar, information dealing with each
sport, and a complete set of rules gov-
erning Intramural sport are contained
in this booklet. The horseshoe tourna-
ment schedule is also featured.

These pamphlets may be secured
anytime at the Intramural quarters on
the third floor of Bartlett gymnasium
free of charge.

With the first quarter well under
way. The Daily Maroon again plans
to put out the Friday literary page
which was originated last year, and
met with such enthusiastic success.
This section is to be under the su-
pervision of Miss Alice Kinsman
who has had three years' experience
in work of this type. Miss Kinsman
was appointed by the Maroon Board
of Controls. A theater review col-'
umn conducted by Bill Jost. and
entitled “On the Boards,” will be
one of the distinctive features of
he sheet. In addition to this a

“First Raters” is the title of a short
story by Prof. Frank Hurlbut O’Hara,
Director of Undergraduate Activities,
which will appear in Sunday’s Roto-
gravure section of the Chicago Daily
Tribune.

“A girl who thought she came from
a family of failures—that was Jessica
Hill—she gives a heart throb to the
powerful short story by Mr. O’Hara.”
is the explanation of the story given
in the Tribune.

Many of Mr. O’Hara’s short stories
have been published before, one in
particular entitled “A Story the Edi-
tor Didn’t Want,” whioh appeared last
year.

By pledging a total of three hundred
and ten men, the fraternities of the
University this year surpassed last

eighty-seven by thirteen men. Sigma
Nu leads the list with nineteen pledges
with Phi Delta Theta a close second
with eighteen, the average number was
ten, eight fraternities having this num-

Chicago; Henry Fisher,

“The University of Chicago, founded by the Baptists, invaded
by the Jews, and demoralized by the Greeks, lies southeast of the
Stock-yards and slightly west of the belt of intellectual achievement.

From the opening sentence to the concluding period the North
article is just such shrill, hasty, wise-cracking stuff. We have no
animosity against this Mr. North. He is probably full of intellectual
promise; but till he grows up and gets over his sophomoric delight
in the praise of his sardonic peers it would be better for him not
to publish too much.

The Daily Maroon is not an organ of extreme conservatism.
It believes that North and the “New Students,” • while not to be
taken too seriously, are indications of a healthy though immature

skepticism on the part of students about universities in general.

But it is obvious that a concoction of superficial observations,
surface conclusions and epigrammatic half-truths is no adequate pic-
ture of the university or of the genuine values which a univer-
sity represents. Current criticism of the University of Chicago has
been of this type.

We are devoting some thirty-five lines of good editorial space
not to North or to the “New Student” but to this whole trend of
cheap criticism. Occasionally people actually swallow this stuff for
gospel truth. More often they are gently amused. And when they
find out that North and the editors of the “New Student” continue
to study at their respective universities in spite of the overwhelming
defects of those universities they conclude that possibly there is
something to this higher education after all.

AND NOW COMES ELECTION TIME

THERE have always been cliques. There always will be. The
* issue cannot be dodged. It can only be directed. And The
Daily Maroon stands directly in the channel to dam or to damn the
political flood.

We stand unequivocally for electing men capable of handling
the highest attainable position. Incompetent men and women must
be barred from responsible positions. The final decision rests with
you.

Forewarned is forarmed. The Daily Maroon will, during elec-
tion week, use this column to decry and ridic.ule any political moves
that are not aboveboard. And we daresay that names and organ-
izations will be liberally sprinkled throughout.

THE SECRET

OF HIGHER GRADES

Woodworth’s Book Store Gives Facts and Figures Derived from
Daily Contact With Both Faculty and Students

Ask any editor “What is the se-
cret of higher marks and better
progress in school?”

His answer will be: “Make work
interesting and easy.”

It's not such a bard thing to do!
Give the student a typewriter.

.. Writing is work—real drudgery,
for most people.

Fy/vwriting is fun. There is a
pleasure in seeing the words appear
clear, clean and sharp on the paper;
in watching them dance off the keys
—almost automatically!—at the tap
of your fingers.

The student who uses a typewriter

is sure to do better work—

Because typed notes are apt
more complete and accurate
written ones;

Bevause the legibility of

to be
than

type-

written notes helps the student to re-
view them frequently and easily;

Vecause typewriting becomes auto-
matic, thereby freeing the mind of

bothersome detail, and
concentration;

and chiefly,

Because typewriting is
ing, and leads to clear

promoting

clear writ-
thinking—

which is the basis of all good work.

Suppose you were
and daily had to read
hundreds of papers—

Each one of them

an instructor,
scores, perhaps

scrawled in a

handwriting either cramped or sprawl-
ing or angular or microscopic, but al-
most always illegible—

Wouldn't you smile with relief
when there came to your hand a
paper not written but typed'; a paper
easily read and clearly understood.

BIG TEN TEAMS

IN BIG GAMES

NEXT SATURDAY

Ohio And Chicago Invade
East; Conference

Lid Lifted

Saturday's games disclosed little on
which to base future conference pre-
dictions. ' All of the teams with the
exception of Minnesota who lost to
Notre Dame, 20-7. faced opponents
far helow the high standard set by
the .Conference elevens. Considerable
light, however, will he thrown on the
Conference football situation this
Saturday, for in addition to four in-
ter-conference games there are two im-
portant inter-sectional games to be
played.

As an in»er-sect.ionaf game, the
Ohio State-Columbia contest ranks
next in importance to the Chicago-
Pennsylvania game. Ohio State has
displayed unmistakable signs of of-
fensive power in her first two games.
Ohio State is favored to win. They
did last year, 9-0.

The Wisconsin eleven which ob-
viously played under wraps in its 13-0
victory over Kansas last week m-ets
Purdue Saturday.

Minnesota who was beaten but not
disgraced by the powerful Notre Dame
team. 20-7. is lated to tackle the h:gh-
scoring Michigan Wolverines in the
first of a two-game series. The for-
ward-passing Wolverines have ace Ul-
ulated 07 points in two games.

Northwestern, with Capt. “Moon”
Raker playing in his best form, will
meet Indiana in the first of the only
other two-game series which will be
played among Conference teams this
year. The Purple eleven looked im-
pressive in their 31-3 victory over Carl-
eton, while Indiana was given quite a
battle by Kentucky before winning
14-6.

Iowa and Illinois, both of whom
have demonstrated considerable early
season strength will clash at Urbana
in a game which will go far in deter-
mining the final standing of both
teams.

Hockey Scrimmage
Pictured In Times

Crack! And as hockey stick drives
ball. University forwards break
through the ranks of the opposing
team and into the rotogravure via
picture, freshman and seniors will play
hockey on a page of the New York
Times in the near future. Two pho-
tographers for that paper snapped the
women as they went into action on
the Midway yesterday.

Last year's picture, which might
well have been entitled: “How Hockey
Should Not lie Played,” was an ex-
cellent example of obstruction. Yester-
day preceding the taking of the picture
coaches warned the women to keep,
j not hinder their team-mates.

POST HOURS OF

RIDING CLASS

Definite hours for women’s riding
classes have been arranged according

NON-FRAT ATHLETES
MEET TO ORGANIZE

U. Bowling Alleys
To Open Tomorrow

Due to unexpected delays the Uni-
versity howling alleys were unable to
open on scheduled time, Monday, but
will be opened Wednesday morning
instead, according to Bill King, stu-
dent manager.

The alleys, which are this year under
the management of the University
Athletic department, Avil! he open to
students from H o’clock each morning

DISCOVER NEW

ARABIAN TALES

Men who are not already in an
organized non-fraternity sports club
will have the opportunity to form
teams for any of the competitions in
which they happen to be interested
on Wednesday night at 7:30 when
there will be a meeting of the n m-
frat men in Room A of Reynolds Club.
Every person attending the meeting
will be enabled to get into a team
for whatever Intramural sport he

chooses.

Immediate action on the schedules
will follow this meeting.

MAROONS FACE

SEASON’S REAL

TEST AT PENN

Quakers Still Have Old
Rogers Tc Thayer

Combination

Chicago will bump into one of the
best teams on its schedule when they
journey to Philadelphia to meet Penn-
sylvania on Saturday.

For the Chicago team is still a bit
green in spots while the Quakers have
I an organization that is used io work-
ing together. And Coach Stagg knows
all of this and the hard practise he sent
the Maroon squad through last ni&ht
was just the start of the three day
grind that the gridsters will go through
before they embark for the east cn
Thursday.

Linemen and backs were in separate
groups for the most part of the ses-
sion working together to perfect the
teamwork among the individual men.
The forwards had an intense workout
among themselves first, going over all
of the defense methods especially the
sweet arts of rolling at and blocking
out the opponent, and after an hour of
the drill the heavy Frosh line was
sent against them in a sort of synthe-
tic scrimmage.

The backs went over an intermin-
able series of formations running them
hard and fast. Four full combinations
were kept at it till the plays became
almost machine-like in the way they
worked. The Old Man it is apparent
has not yet found the right combina-
tion and he is keeping the boys at it
until he can pick out those who will
fie together.

From the standpoint of the injuries
received as well as from almost all of
the other angles Saturdays’s game was
good stuff for the Maroons. No really
serious and only a few major injuries
are on this week’s sick list., McDon-
ough, who was kneed in between his
neck and shoulders has a rather pain-
ful set of bruised and strained mus-
cles; McKinney had his shoulder par-
tially dislocated hut luckily it snapped
hack before much harm was done. The
only other injuries were minor bruises.

So it looks as if a rather conditioned
team will go ud against the Penn hus-
kies but one mus always remember
that the old Rogers to Thayer com-
bination that beat Chicago last year
is once more on hand.

BADGER RUNNERS

TOTAL EIGHTY-TWO

Madison, Wis., Oct. 11, 1926—Op-
timistic over prospects of the Wiscon-
sin cross-country squad during the ap-
proaching conference season. Coach
Tom E. Jones is even more pleased
with the opportunitv ^offered bv the
record number of men signed up. to
try out his own theory of combined
physical and mental development.

Eighty-two men are out for the var-
sity first and second teams and twenty-
five sophomores and forty freshmen
have signed up for their respective
class teams. Unless some unforeseen
obstacle arises, the dearth of letter
men will not have a serious effect upon
the calibre of the Wisconsin team.
Since 1908, when cross-country work
took its place on the conference sched-
ules, the Badger harriers have ‘ak *a
more than half of the championships,
and the coach believes that the pres-
ent squad will also make a cred 1 i c
showing. The first meet is with
Chicago.

Twelve -fraternity touchball teams
will take the field this afternoon prim-
ed for victory in the opening day’s play
of the 1926" Intramural season. Inter-
est runs high among the Greeks as
has been daily evidenced by the pre-
season practice sessions going on in
front yards, back yards, vacant lots,
and street corners near fraternity
houses.

Good Opening Game

What is predicted to be the best
game of the day also happens to be
the first. It is the Phi Psi-Phi Gaip
battle which is scheduled for three
o’clock on Court Number One, located
at the south west corner of Woodlawn
Avenue and 60th Street. Both of
these houses list a number of sterling]
athletes among their members and
should swing into action with power
ful attacks that smack of league
championship possibilities.

At the same hour, Alpha Sigma Phi
will engage the strong Chi Psi outfi:
on Court'Number Two, located in the
field on the southwest corner of 60tl
and Woodfawn.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon meets Phi Pi
Phi in the remaining 3 o’clock game
playing at the old field located at 59tl

terest and expected to win handily.

Running concurrent with this game
will be the Phi Beta Delta and Phi
Kappa Sigma contest which will be
held at Court Two. The latter are fav-
ored to cop. Kappa Sigma, boasting
one of the strongest elevens in year’s
battles Lambda Chi Alpha in the re
maining game for this afternoon. This
promising contest is to be played at
Court Three.

An added incentive for participation
in the intramural games this year is
(be Indivdual pont system, a new scor-
ng system devised to award individual
play as well as team play. How these
points are to be awarded will be an-
nounced in a later issue of The Daily
Maroon.

Everything is in readiness for the

opening games
Hagey who is
sport this fall.

according to Harry
managing the major
Fields have been put

into shape, playing equipment secured,
and a staff of dependable referees ar-
ranged for. All information concern-
ing the sport can be found in the I-M
handbook, which Hagey advises every
team to consult before taking the field
today.

“Rufus,” said the wise old
senior to the giddy young
frosh, “I see you being

That’s smart “crackin’,”
whether you’re picking a
“bunch” or a fountain pen.
You want both of them to
live with you a long, long

SOCIALLY SPEAKING

Today we make our bow to the read-
ers of The Daily Maroon. We crave
your indulgence for what will be more
or less of an innovation. It is oure aim
to insert a few pointed remarks and
some casual comments every Tuesday
and Friday into the more or less cut
and dried business of a social calendar.
We hope to make this a little more in-,
teresting than a mere chronicle of events.
And because the idea is new, we ask you
to suspend judgment.

Ordinarily, the sports department
would cover football games; but from
remarks we heard around the stands
Saturday, we are inclined to believe
that they could be listed as social gath-
erings. Some of the feminine rooters
display a supreme ignorance of wl.at
it is all about. From this, we are forced
to conclude that it is partly the desire
to “see everybody” that brings them to
the game. And then, it is a golden op-
portunity to acquire a tea date if you
haven’t one already.

The Drake grill-room had many as-
pects of a mixer last Friday. The at-
mosphere was distinctly “college” and
the floor was easily as crowded. How-

ever the discerning ear could detect a
slight difference in the music.-

We didn’t think the weather was par-
ticularly conducive to a week-end in the
country; but evidently a prominent club
woman did. There must be some at-
traction at Diamond Lake. We don’t
know exactly what it is—but we ha.c
(leas, and doubtless you have too.

And with Friday’s edition the work
really starts and the cooperation of ev-
ery fraternity, club and organization be-
comes essential.

And the social high-lights will become
brighter and the dirt blacker.
