DR. MAXIMOW
LEADS WAR ON

TUBERCULOSIS

Renowned Anatomist Starts
Experimental Work
at University

Tuberculosis—“the mystery disease
of mankind” — faces a new attack
with the experimentation of Dr. Alex-
ander A. Maximow, renowed anato-
mist, who has taken up his work at
the Hull Medical Laboratories of the
University.

Dr. Maximow, whose work during
past years on tuberculosis has won
him international fame, deserted his
experimental work some time ago to
confine himself to technical research
and to the wording of his findings.
Just recently he returned to his
laboratory work, and is now engaged
in a new field of experimentation
known as tissue cultures.

Explain* Reason*

Explaining the methods and reas-
ons for his work, the savant declares
that in his belief man has thus far
failed to rid the world of this curse
because he has been unwilling to
taking the living tissue from a rab-
“start at the beginning,” “I am
bit,” Dr. Maximow declares, “and
after separating it and keeping it
growing, I take a culture of tubercle
bacillae, and with a platinum wire
innoculate the disease into the living,
growing tissue.

“The tissue and bacillae continue
to grow, and I am able to study the
development and interaction between
the two. This question of interac-
tion is the fundamental step. With-
out solving it, we can never progress.
At this point we are able to study
the original and anatomical essentials
of the cells that build these tuber-
cles which appear in the tissue as
they do ia the diseased body.

Take Month* of Work

“Only a colossal amount of experi-
mentation will give us the desired re-
sults—the basis for progress. The
source and action of the elements con-
cerned will furnish invaluable data.
This work may take several months,
hut after it is finished I hope that we
may have some highly worth while
results.”

Assistng the great Russian are Drs.
William Bloom and Nicholas Popoff,
both graduate students with their
degrees of M. I). For the great part
of his delicate work, Dr. Maximow
can trust no one but himself. This
is one of the reasons why the experi-
ments will take so long to mature.

Long hours of tedious work face

Dean Smith Is

Victim of Flu

A third dean of the University fell
temporary victim to the snow and
bitterness, of winter when Dean T. V.
Smith took to his bed with influenza
last Saturday night.

"Although the case is not serious,
every precaution is being taken to
check its progress, and Dean Smith
may not return to his duties for an-
other week,” declares Dr. James
Richard Greer, the physician in at-
tendance at the Smith residence on
Woodlawn avenue. It has not been
necessary to remove the patient to a
hospital.

FRIARS SEARCH
FOR NEW SONGS

Issue Call to Campus Song
Writers

All students of the University who
have written any songs or music are
urged to present them on next Friday
afternoon at 4:30 in the Reynolds
Club theatre, according to Paul C.
Cullom. Abbot of "Blackfriars.” An
innovation is being introduced this
year in this contest, which is not a
tryout for the annual show of “Black-
friars.” Any music, whether it is in-
tended for the show or not, is de-
sired.

Although the presentation of this
music will have no direct bearing on
the selections of songs for the show,

it is being held under
“Blackfriars” to get a

this year. All those

tigator. indicates that the bail system
here and the whole system of crim-
inal justice administration needs dras-
tic revision, it is revealed in the re-
port of Dr. Arthur L. Beeley for his
thesis in the school of social service
administration.

The survey has led to an elaborate
list of recommendations which Dr.
Beeley suggests may remedy some of
the existing evils in the system.

Bail Policy at Fault

That there are persons committed
to jail for failure to provide sureties,
who might safely and easily be al-
lowed their freedom pending trial. Dr.
Beeley says, is a fact which seems
fully established by his enquiry. As-
suming the validity of the investiga-
tional methods employed, and the
more or less constant quality of the
unsentenced jail population, the num-
ber of such persons is large enough
to warrant a drastic revision of the
Chicago bail policy, in' the interests
of justice and economy, he thinks.

According to the technique and cri-
teria employed in the study, at least
65 or about 28 per cent of the 225
cases selected at random, were need-
lessly imprisoned while awaiting final
court action.

The unsentenced jail population

the Selwyn theater.

Shortly after leaving the Univer-
sity Mr. Hayakawa became famous
on the silver sheet where he enjoyed
the popularity of the army of Amer-
ican theatre-goers. Thus it is a rare
treat to see in person an actor whom
the cinema clientele has not had
sight of for several years.

Play Has Oriental Touch

The play is about Oriental intri-
gue, opium dens—called love cities
in China—and has a London draw-
ing room scene. Mr. Hayakawa as
a wealthy, unscrupulous proprietor
of a den, habitually frequented by
English and American tourists of
high society, shuffles his way in gor-

geous, sumptuous robes of an opium
king in China, and*as the Manchu
prince in English society, he wooes
the wife of his wealthy drug client.

In both characterizations Mr.
Hayakawa gives evidence of his
western stamp and the polished re-
finement of his elected abode, assist-
ed no doubt by his attendance at
the University. Mr. Hayakawa is
thoroughly acclimatized to American
modes and manners. In the second

BANQUET

The last big function of this year’s
administration of Y. W. C. A. will
be the annual Friendship dinner to
take place tomorrow at 6 in the sun-
parlor of Ida Noyes hall. At this
banquet the officers for the coming
year will be installed, and the new
cabinet will be announced.

In former years the dinner has
been held in either the refectory or in
the gymnasium. The menu for the
dinner, which will be served cafteria
style, will be as follows: meat loaf,
mashed potatoes, pickles, rolls and
hot cross buns, ice cream, cake and
coffee.

Tickets for the dinner may be ob-
tained for fifty cents from the mem-

dred and fifty women are expected
to attend the dinner, since this is one
of the rare occasions when all mem-
bers of the organization can get to-

BY “BULL" DURHAM

Strange things have been happen-
ing at the Deke House. Students on
their way to eight o’cVcks this morn-
ing were halted in front of 5715 Wood-
lawn avenue by a watery sheet of ice
which extended from the front of the
house to the middle of the street,
leaving no possible means of getting
past other than crossing the street.

This situation was the cause of
much excited comment and conjec-
ture on campus yesterday. None
seemed to know just what had hap-
pened to cause this piedmont glacier
which had its source in the house of
one of our better known fraternities.
It was rumored wildly that the Dekes,
being naturally a hot crowd, had be-
come overheated and had been obliged
to call the fire department, who were
responsible for the water. Other per-
sons, more conservative, stated that
John Deke had fallen asleep in the
bathtub with the water turned on. It
was thought by others that the Dekes
were merely, in the absence of snow,
attempting to create a winter atmos-
phere so as to justify a few more
weeks’ wear for their big bearskins. I

Peter; and Lester Brill, Tobias.

“The Stranger’ is a dyed-in-the
blood melodrama, according to Ralph
J. Helperin, student manager of the
production. The cast will give a
burlesque of the story, that of the
return and repentance of an erring
wife who has deserted her husband
and children. Her pathetic agony
when she feels she is forgotten and
she cannot declare herself, has many
times been echoed in earlier plays
and stories of which “East Lynne,”

place in campus activities with great
success. Since his departure the high
office that he held has been filled by

Candidates for this election were
chosen by petition. Petitioning closed
at nine o’clock last evening with Jo-
seph Gubbins, Robert Jackson, Clyde
Keutzer and John Howe on the list.

These men were chosen by petition,
as the Undergraduate Council be-

AT DINNER

Newly elected W. A. A. officers
will be installed tonight at 5:30 in
the theatre of Ida Noyes hall. A
banquet will follow the ceremony, as
has been the custom in former years.
At this time Frances Lawton will be
installed as president; Eleanor Wil-
kins as vice president; Polly Ames
as secretary; and Marjorie Burrell
as treasurer. These women have
been prominent in the organization’s
work for the past year, serving
either as officers or as board mem-
bers.

Immediately after the installation
ceremony, the women will adjourn
to the sun parlor for dinner. A
limited number of tickets is left, and
Marie Remmert, who is in charge of
the affair, has urged that these be
procured this morning. A desk has
been placed in the foyer of Ida No-
yes hall for that purpose.

The next function of the organiza-
tion will be the basketball dinner
to be held Friday night. Adelaide
Ames, board representative for bas-
ketball is in charge of arrange-
ments. The honor team will play
the alumnae following the dinner,

ONE SUGGESTION FOR THE DRAMATS

By An Observer

'T'HE Dramatic association prospers now as it never did before.

It is better organized and its shows are better attended. But
its shows are not the drawing-card they might be. Too often one
attends them because attendance is the thing—not because he wants
to see them.

Analyzing this problem, we must consider, first, the competition
downtown. The season s best plays come to Chicago from New
York; amateurs have a tough job. But the University has com-
petent actors, and adequate facilities for production. The profes-
sional stage is not far ahead of us there. The difficulty then, must be
largely in the selection of plays. A good three-act play by a pro-
fessional playwright, or a musical show depending not on plot but
on songs, dancing, and cleverness of detail, makes a real appeal to
the student. But when amateur plays are produced, the public be-
comes indifferent. Amateur plays seldom contain good character-
izaiton. The amateur playwright is apt to build his story wholly on
one striking incident, and pay no attention to the characters enact-
ing the incident. Character should dominate plot; in amateur writ-
ing, action tends to dominate character, and the situation is unreal.

To insure popularity for college dramatics, I recommend pro-
fessional plays.

(This suggestion obviously does not apply to musical produc-
tions. Its aim is to increase voluntary patronage of campus produc-
tions, and to base that patronage on exactly the same appeal which
professional productions strive to obtain.)

MAKING STUDENTS WORK

(Continued from page 1)
was found to be made up largely of
young men, most of whom are white,
native born and single. Ordinarily,
the investigator reports, about two-
thirds of them are under 31 years of
age, and from about one-third to one-
half are under 21. Most of these per-
sons are charged with felonious
crimes, although the municipal court
of Chicago, without final jurisdiction
in felony cases, makes a final dispo-
sition in a considerable proportion of
the cases.

These prisoners are not transients,
Dr. Beeley declares. According to
several samples taken within the last
two years, about 90 per cent of the
unsentenced population at any one
time are persons, who at the time of
the arrest, have lived in Chicago over
one year. Almost two-thirds of those
in the sample studied intensively had
lived in Chicago over five years, and
about one-third were born and had
lived here all their lives.

Many “First-timers”

Th< assumption that the unsen-
tenced jail prisoner is usually an ha-
bitual offender or “jail bird” is called
a fallacy by Dr. Beeley. While in the
sample studied, about 61 per cent of
the defendants had local records of
previous arraignments, only ’about
one-half of them had a local record of
previous convictions. Still fewer,
about 25 per cent, had ever been sen-
tenced to imprisonment.

To a surprising extent the unsen-
tenced jail prisoner has good refer-
ences at his command. Dr. Beeley
found. They were usually employers,
physicians, ministers, social workers,

A T the New Hampshire State College a plan has been instituted
X whereby students will be.forced to spend fifty hours each week
in class preparation in order to fulfill the requiremnets for a degree.

Is such a requirement necessary in a univrsity by normal stu-
dents? Do students need to be threatened in order to make them
fulfil] course requirements?

We know through psychological experiments that certain in-
dividuals are able to perform twice as much work as others in the
same length of time. And even if all persons could work at a uni-
form rate of speed normally, certain of these persons would find
some means of wasting time just as effectively as they do when left
to their own devices.

Despite these requirements, students will ultimately expend as
much energy as their inclination or their conscience dictates, and
surely no amount of urging or even proctoring will effect any radical
change in their natures.

THE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

FOUR students at Columbia university achieve a sort of Parnassus,
and are recognized acordingly in The Columbia Spectator:

Four of Columbia’s literary stu-
dents are to be honored by the com-
pilers of an anthology of intercol-
legiate verse, by having work pub-
lished in Morningside during the
past year chosen for publication.
Miss Madge Turner of Barnard has
also had one of her stories selected
for publication in the book as an ex-
ample of the type of literature which
represents the fiction of such a Cam-
pus publication as Morningside.

Contribution to the collegian’s fund of knowledge, or technique
of living, by a lecturer at the University of Illinois, as recorded in
The Daily lllini:

“All theories of management, and
training for management in college
or out, simmer down to the question
of the ability to handle people,” was
the conviction of Archer Wall Doug-
las, in his concluding lecture yester-
day afternoon, on the subject of
“The College Man and His Job.”

“The man of an analytic turn of
mind should choose accountancy of
a like subject as his profession,”
said Mr. Douglas. Likewise a tech-
nical nature should turn to electrical

self analysis, and the pursuit of the

thing that a man really likes best.

“Salesmanship consists of selling
yourself,” he stated. “The salesman
has his goods to promote, but the
primary necessity is selling himself,

Unearthed Play

Mr. Hayakawa unearthed the play
while touring in Europe. It had
“gone over big” in Vienna. So the
ex-movie idol purchased it and
brought it to his alma mater town.

He is expected on campus soon
to grapple with the Bartlett wrest-
lers perhaps, and to recall his col-
lege days.

The play was written by Bachwitz,
a German playwright, who has pro-
duced a great many pieces for the
European stage, but comparatively
few for the States.

Sessue Hayakaaw is the second
student at the university to become
very popular on the American stage.

PHI SIGS DEFEAT

DELTA SIGMA PHI

FOR THIRD PLACE

Sigma Nu Wins From Tau
Sigma Omicron for “B”
League Title

Outclassing the Delta Sigs in all de-
partments of the game, the Phi Sigma
Delta "A” basketball team won, 26 to
14, and thereby annexed third place
in* intramural standings. This puts

the Delta Sigs in fourth place.
Preiss Stars

Harold Preiss starred for the
tors. Jumping into the play at

vic-
the

beginning of the contest, he scored
Jhe initial basket. Then he bewil-
dered the Delta Sigs with basket after
basket, with a few free throws and
scores by his teammates to vary the
monotony of the game. The Phi Sigs
led throughout the tilt, leading at the
half bv the score of 18 to 9, just doub-
ling the count of the losers.

At half time Preiss had four baskets
and two free throws to his credit.
Then he seemed to slow down. In-
stead of trying for points himself, he
fed the ball to his teammates, who
were not so -successful as he but who
were still good enough to keep their
lead and win. As it was. he made one
more field goal before the final whistle
blew.

Guarding a Feature

Barnes scintillated for the losers
with three baskets to his credit. Faris
and Gray also played good games.
Ilie guarding of the Phi Sigs was the

feature of the game,
low aided in the Phi
great extent.

Zolla and Cap-

in the closest game of. the evening’s
play, Sigma Nu beat out Tau Sigma
Oniricon. 12-0. With but one minute
to play and the score 10-9 in favor
of Sigma Nu, the losers made fren-
. zied efforts to tie or win, but failed.

Sherwin made all 12 points for the
victors while Rosenthal starred for the

This win gives

championship to the Sigma Xu squad,
with Tau Sigma Oniricon second, by

Phi Sig Ponies Repeat

The Phi Sig IVmies won their match
for third place in the “B league by
the score of 25 to 5, making it a big
night for the Phi Sigs. 1 he game was
one-sided, the Phi Sigs leading the
Zeta Beta Taus all the way.

Fingold starred for the winners
with five baskets and two tree throws.
He simply ran rings around the weak
Zebe team. The only player of merit
on the whole losing squad was Kirsh-

for the losers.

Ubyssey”Denounces Proposal to

Introduce Football Into Canada

Notwithstanding the widely-adver-
tised exploits of Red Grange, George
Wilson, Swede Oberlander, and the
numerous other athletes whose fame
was born on the gridiron, and the
deluge of shekels which pour into the
stadiums of United States' universities
during the fall, the Ubyssey. campus
press organ of the University of Brit-
ish Columbia, goes on record as de-
nouncing violently and vehemently
the proposal to introduce the great
autumn pastime in that school.

And the reasons which it enumer-
ates for its clearly defined stand are
interesting. The Ubyssey expresses a
fear that English rugby—“just as good
a game as American football”—would
be sapped of both players and sup-

grown up many of the worst features
of American college life. Outstand-
ing amongst these is a stress of the
physical and the temporary over the
intellectual and the permanent. Thus
there is a tendency to exploit brawn,
produce mentally unequipped gladia-

upon the successful coach rather than
the successful professor . . . therefore
we consider the suggestion as palpa-

LOCALS DEFEAT

ILLINI TANKMEN

The fighting Indians returned to
the greens of the Illini with trailing
colors after receiving a stinging de-
feat at the hands of the Maroon
mermen. The afternoon dual meet
ended 42 to 27 with the local nata-
tors controlling the docks. This is
the third dual victory of the season
for MacGillivray men.

The Chicago swimmers were at
their best, looking forward to finish-
ing the season with a victory, thus
making up the time lost in the dire-
ful defeats obtained in the earlier
dual meets. Captain Ed. Noyes won
both the forty and century events

with ease with
taking seconds,
made by Noyes.

meets which are being held the 12th

“Hank” Sackett, two years for-
ward on the basketball team, was
elected captain of the 1927 quintet
at a meeting held Friday. At this
gathering Coach Norgren also an-
nounced the awarding of the basket-
ball “C’s.”

Defensive Forward

Sackett is also the chairman of
the National Interscholastic Basket-
ball tournament to be held at Bart-
lett the last of this month. He Is
a junior, and a member of the Phi
Kappa Psi fraternity. He played re-
gularly at right forward this sea-
son, while in 1925 he played inter-
mittently as a substitute. He fitted
in well with Norgren’s style of play
distinguishing himself as a strong
defensive forward while he also

showed an
shots.

Six men

were given major “C’s,”
English “C’s.” Of the
men, five were awarded

their letters for the first time. Cap-
tain Alyea has won his letter for
three years, while Henry Sackett,
Walter Marks, John McDonough,
Charles Hoerger, and Theodore
Zimmerman are new awards. The
three players who received minor
awards were William Mcklind, Bo
McConnel, and L. Farwell.

Prospects Bright

Next season’s prospects are bright
for all these players will be back-
next year, with the exception of
Captain Alyea whose graduation will
leave a big gap in the center posi-
tion. Sackett and Marks are jun-
iors, while the rest are sophomores.

Illini but graced the score with a
placer ahead of his teammate Eddy
Fellinger.

All in all, seven firsts were taken
and numerous seconds and thirds
which talk well for the way the
swim team picked up since their last
defeat at the hands of Wisconsin.
The polo team outscored the Cham-
paign crew 5 to 1 in a fast exhibition
of the new splash game. Captain
Petrolowitz with Hall, Howe, White,
Krough, Gordon, Greenberg and Jeli-
nek kept the hostile poloers at bay
and finished the affair without the
close score expected. The game
started out as if it would be a merry
battle, but once the Maroon machine
got under way, the baskets were
made in regular succession.

basketball season is complete ■ in the Big Ten, for Behr of Wis-
without an All-Conference team. It I consin and “Black” Rasey of Minne-
therefore becomes our odious but in-

escapable duty to sort out the out-
standing performers from the me-
diocre ones and concoct the former
into some sort of combination that
will be the best defensively and of-
fensively that the feverish 1926 sea-'
son has produced.

Forwards Chosen

For one forward we unhesitatingly I
choose Capt. George Spradling of1

sota were two expert forwards with
unerring eyes for the basket. Krue-
ger of Indiana, Chambers of Michi-
gan, Daugherity of Illinois, Van
Deusen and the sensational Phillips
of Iowa were other track forwards
who had to be left off the first team
because there is only room for two.
Moon Baker of Northwestern might

have been chosen, but
spoiled his chances.

The topoff position was
one to pick this year, for

ineligibity

Purdue as slick a dribbler as ever
dribbled a dribble on anyman’s floor.
Sprad was a fatal long shot and once ।	, x

,	. , ,	, . „	. .	no real star like Camey. Giant

he broke loose on his famous drib-	.

,,	, , ,	, . I bookie Cunningham is chosen be-

bling—under the basket short shots I

—you could swear to its being a
basket. Ask Hoerger, he knows.

For a running mate to the shifty
Spradling, we pick the stocky Beck-
ner of Indiana. In Indiana they use '
basketballs for rattles and its seems
that Beckner learned how to mani-
pulate his rattle to perfection. |
Beckner is one of the high scorers
of the Big Ten, as deadly as one J
can possibly be and one of the tricki- *
est dribblers in the game. His style j
reminds one of Rollie Williams.
Practically every man on the Hoos-
ier squad was of All-Conference
caliber but Beckner gets the call be-
cause of his consistency.

Many Others

That’s not saying that there were

a difficult
there was

cause of his experience, eye for the
basket, height, and mainly because
there weren’t any better ones.

The Chicago Tribune has a few
positions open in its Want Ad de-
partment for university students
whose schedules are so arranged that
they have Saturday mornings or Fri-
day afternoons free.

The work is interesting and re-
munerative, and should appeal to in-
telligent women who appreciate
pleasant and refined surroundings.

Experience is not necessary, as be-
ginners are given training in sales
presentation, general advertising
principles, and voice culture.

We have a number of graduates of
the University of Chicago who de-
vote their entire time to this work,
and 85 % of the department have
attended universities, colleges or
finishing schools.

If you are interested, please write
a letter of application to the Man-
ager, Telephone Want Ad depart-
ment, Room 1015 Tribune Tower,
giving complete details and whether
you wish full time or part time em-
ployment. Only written applica-
tions will be given consideration.

“At Home” Lunch.

The ideal food is something light,
yet satisfying, appetizing without
being elaborate—in short easy to
prepare and easy to serve.

Shredded
Wheat

fills the bill perfectly. Thousands
of fair young stewardesses all over
the country can testify to its popu-
larizing, energizing qualities; its
adaptability to a number of out-of-
the-ordinary menus.

Try Shredded Wheat at your next
party lunch and see. The same bis-
cuits of golden brown whole wheat
that you have always preferred for
breakfast, you know.
