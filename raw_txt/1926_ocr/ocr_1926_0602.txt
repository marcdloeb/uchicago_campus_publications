THEY CALL THIS ONE
THE “FINAL” NUMBER

The last issue of the Phoenix,
which will come out one week
from Thursday, will be known as
the “Final” number, which Fred
Handschy, editor, declares to be
particularly pertinent at exam
time.

The cover is by Rainey Ben-
nett. It has been characterized as
“flaming'” by over-awed spectators
and the editors are well satisfied,
it is asserted.

“The quality of the contribu-
tions should be as unrestrained,”
said Handschy, “and as srightly as
a young professor in knlcker, at a
picnic, driving a Chrysler.” As
usual, the damage is two bits, and
also as usual, the fate of the is-
sue will he in the hands of campus
women.

All the talent of the campus hu-
mor artists has been brought to-
gether to make this last issue the
best of the year, according to
Handschy.

REVISE SYSTEM OF
COUNSELLORS FOR
FRESHMAN WOMEN

Incoming Freshman women will be
introduced to the University next
fall by a better organized group of
upperclass counsellors than that of
last year, according to the latest plans
of Federation. The new plan is to
have several meetings of all the wom-
en who feel interested in assuming
the responsibility of guiding four or
five freshmen instead of one or two.
At these meetings definite instruc-
tions as to procedure will be given.
The first meeting will be held tomor-
row at 12:45 in the alumnae room of
Ida Noyes hall.

In order to give the new freshmen
an idea of the traditions of the
University spirit and the various ac-
tivities they may enter, each counsel-
lor will conduct a personal correspon-
dence with the women she has had
assigned to her. All counsellors are
expected to be on campus during
Freshman Week, September 27 to
October 4. “The main purpose of
this new plan is to put the new wom-
en in charge of women who are real-
ly interested in their welfare,” said
Helen King, chairman of the Upper
class councillor committee of Fed-
eration.

To boost the World’s Greatest

of charge to University students all
day tomorrow. The tags, in conjunc-

dodgers which will be given out in
Chapel this week, are part of the gen-
eral program of advertising the
meet.

Fifty women, representative of the
several women’s organizations, have
been appointed by the committee to
distribute the tags. This is the earli-
est Interscholastic activity in which
the campus women may participate.

ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR
CONVOCATION READY

Convocation announcements and
tickets for convocation are available
for candidates and faculty in the
President’s office beginning Tuesday,
June 1.

All women taking degrees at the
approaching convocation are request-
ed to wear dark dresses, dark shoes
and hose, and white collars on their
convocation gowns. This is an estab-
lished custom and has been observed
previously in promoting a democratic
spirit.

Not only is the state of Washing-
ton famed for the tall lumber that
grows on its mountains’ sides, but it
is evidently a place where they grow
boys to an immense height. At least
that is the impression of Miss Pow-
ers, chief of the athletic office, who
has received a telegram from the
coach of the track team at Whatcom
high school, at Billingham, Washing-
ton, which asks for special accommo-
dations for one of the members of
the team.

The athlete mentioned in the tele-
gram answers to the name of Paul
Jessup and his height while standing
in his stocking feet is cited as being
six feet, seven inches. Incidently he
holds the state record for tossing the
discus and is evidently planning to
continue with his creditable perform-
ances at the World’s Greatest Inter-
scholastic.

cially they seem quite successful.
They do so many gay things that as
material for literature they are ex-
tremely adequate. Collegiate acts in
revues and in vaudeville are popular
because they are trying to express
youthfulness and in this age the
world is much addicted to youth.”

FOUR PARTICIPATE
IN ADDAMS FINALS

Four members of the University
will compete in the final Florence
James Addams contest in artistic
reading, which will be held tomorrow
at 4:30 in Harper Mil. The partici-
pants are Carlton H. Graves, Fred-
erick W. Place, Evelyn Turner and
Almedia Hamilton, who were chosen
in previous competition held last
week. The prizes of $75 and $25
will be awarded to the winners in
the final contest. “The final contes-
tants eliminated a big field of read-
ers,” said Mr. Nelson.

Daily reports from the County
Hospital indicate that the veteran
trainer, Tom Eck, will not last
more than two or three days. All
hope for his recovery has been sur-
rendered, and every possible form
of artificial stimulation is being
used to keep him alive.

“There is scarcely any percep-
tible change in Mr. Eek’s condi-
tion from day to day,” states Dr.
K. B. Novak. “Complications
have not set in, but the steady
weakening discourages medical as-
sistance. Death may come at any
moment.”

Although their mentor lies des-
titute in a County institution,
Tom’s “boys” haven’t forgotten
him.

DISAPPOINTED BOX
HOLDERS TO HAVE
MAIN FLOOR SEATS

Women’s organizations scheduled
to occupy the horseshoe of boxes at
Mandel hall on the night of Senior
Vaudeville will be given reserved
seats on the main floor, owing to the
fact that the change of date to the
same night as the presentation of
awards makes a conflict. By this set
tlement the horseshoe will still be
occupied by women, while the organ-
izations that had reserved boxes for
Friday will be compensated by main
floor seats.

Except for this unavoidable con-
flict in the matter of boxes, arrange-
ments for the Saturday night presen-
tation of senior vaudeville have pro-
ceded smoothly, according to Fred
Handschy, co-chairman of the vaude-
ville this year.

Swedish Folk Dancers
Entertain Campus Club

Dressed in native costumes, five
Swedish folk dancers will entertain
at the last meeting of the Scandin-
avian club tonight at 7:45 in Ida
Noyes hall. Mr. and Mrs. Paul
Frojd, Esther and Ingrid Andreasson
and Mr. Vernon Moren, the dancers
will illustrate folk dancing and
games to the accompaniement of folk
music.

The alumni of the University have
contributed $2,000,000 toward the
development fund, it was announced
today. A gift of $80,000 from Rob-
ert Law Jr. ’97, of New York City
received yesterday by the University
completed the alumni quota. The
fund now totals $7,548,000. The to-
tal amount of gifts including restrict-
ed contributions from alumni and
the public not to be considered as
part of the development program is
$11,133,644.

Not'fy Alumni

Alumni all over the country were
notified yesterday that the quota had
been reached. The announcement re-
called the inauguration of the cam-
paign among former students, when
President Ernest DeWitt Burton,
shortly before his death, set forth
the purposes and ideals of what was
to be the greater University. The
president, then failing in health, de-
scribed the university which is now
materializing in stone and resources
on the Midway. His speech, said to
be one of the most stirring he had
ever delivered, was made to 1200

alumni meeting at the
Mart March 24, 1925,
broadcast to thousands of
throughout the country.

Answer Plea

Furniture
and was
old grads

The response to the late president’s
plea for funds with which to carry
on the work of building the greater
university came from 11,500 alumni.
Herbert Zimmermann, vice president
of R. R. Donnelley and Sons, acted
as general chairman. Chicago alum-
ni, under the local chairmanship of
John P. Mentzer, gave $1,232,000.
New York City alumni oversubscribed
their quota of $200,000. Southern
California contributed $44,660.
Cleveland completed its quota of
$19,880. In many cities every alum-
nus subscribed. According to the
announcement, 153 alumni, many of
them missionaries, in thirty foreign
countries, subscribed $11,410.

Robert Law, Jr., a wealthy New
York business man, whose gift com-
pleted the alumni quota took an ac-
tice part in the affairs of the class
of 1897. After leaving the Univer-
sity he went east and there continued
to manifest his interest in University
affairs. When he heard that the Uni-
versity needed $80,000 of alumni
contributions, he wired his gift to
President Max Mason.

STRANGERS

THE students have very little to do with our professors. We hear
’ them lecture once a day; we confer with them perhaps twice
a quarter; and in most cases that is the extent of our contact. We
meet on the street, greet each other politely, and walk on. Some-
times, indeed, we have long conversations, and learn to look more
deeply into this subject or that; and we remember such talks. But
they are rare.

We might learn, in private, informal talks with our professors, many
things that our education now lacks. We could learn some of the
truths that lie beyond lecture notes and reading references. We
could learn just how big a thing knowledge is, and how little of it
one man or one age can master. We could learn how real are |
the facts, the laws, and the theories that we recite, and how close
they are to life itself. We could learn to study our history, our
political economy, our literature, “from the viewpoint of eternity.”
The professor might teach us such lessons as these, outside of class.
But we ignore each other.

Both we and the professor have our reasons for this segraga-
tion. For one thing, we are busy. He has his research; we have
our activities. We have little time left for each other. But we have
time to talk with our fraternity brothers after lunch; and he has
time for a half-hour’s chat at the club. Something else keeps us
apart. We are afraid of ridicule. Our friends will watch us fol-
low Prof. Goggins into his office. "Charley,” they will say, “is!
working the old man for a B. And other professors will watch, too.
“Goggins is playing to the gallery,” they will whisper. They may
well watch for such vices; for the flattering student and the dem-
agogue professor are enemies of education. Only genuine interest
must prompt the conversation between professor and pupil. But
we need that interest, and that conversation.

The student must forget that he is busy. He always has time
to learn something; otherwise college is not the place for him.
Both student and professor must forget their bashfulness. They
must be willing to risk some ridicule. With these obstacles out of
the way. They can find opportunities to talk things over. Perhaps
the fraternity houses can entertain professors at dinner; perhaps
the Quadrangle club can entertain students. At any rate, there
are walks in Jackson Park. Socrates had no better salon.

880 Men Scheduled to
In Great 1926
Meet

Run

By Gen Florez

Proceeding the battles at Soldiers’
field this coming Saturday, Friday
at 1:30 in the early afternoon, ath-
letes of track fame will compete in
preliminary events at Stagg Field.
The meet is drawing more than have
ever been entered since the Inter- (
scholastic began in 1902. Seven
hundred men of high school caliber
and 180 Academy Athletes are sched-
uled to appear on the campus track
field. The number of men entered
this year outnumbers last year’s en-
try list by 200.

Francisco of Mooseheart To Star

Burt Francisco, crackerjack sprin-
ter, of Mooseheart, who tied the
world’s record for the 60 yard dash
in 6 1-5 seconds at the N. A. A. U.
meet, will be one of the feature men
in the fray. He has beaten both
Murchison and Coaffee, who have
been considered the cream of sprint-
ing material.

George Simpson of Columbus is
another well known entry who has
traveled the cinders in 9 4-5 seconds
for the century event. Miller of
Elmwood and Wiggins of El Dorado
have both cleared the high jump bar
at 6 feet 3 5-8 inches. There will
be a heated fight between those two
space clearers which will be worth
seeing.

St. John’# Heads Entry Litt

St. John’s Academy has entered
26 men in the meet thus leading the
entry list in the academy division.
Taylor, one of the Delafield, Wiscon-
sin satellites, holds the world’s rec-
ord having traveled the 120 yard
hurdles in 151-10 at the Ohio Re-
lays. Jimmy Babcock is doing fast
time at the 220 grind and is to help

lowans Hit Maroon
Hurlers in Easy Win

Every conceivable kind of base-
ball—good, mediocre, bad—was
exhibited when the University of
Iowa nine played the Maroons on
the Midway lot yesterday after-
noon. The greater part of the dis-
play was bad. and as the Maroons
showed more of this type of game
they lost 18 to 6.

Norgren’s men must have left
all their good baseball at Colum-
bus, where they won the bitterest
kind of a battle from Ohio State
in ten innings Saturday. Gubbins
heaved heroically against the Sta-
ters in that game and consequent-
ly was not in condition to start
Monday’s game.

Evidently Macklind and Zim-
merman were not, either, for their
floaters and would-be-foolers were
pounded accurately and heartily
by the Iowa batsmen.

WHATo/ IT?

^/GEOR^E MOiyiNSTtiy

Rushing of the interscholastic boys
has been got down to a fine art this
year, if one is to believe Mr. Bert
McKinney and some of the other
smoother fellows of the university,
who are in charge of the handgrasp-
ing brigade. Not only has each of
the boys on the rushing committee
got his knickers (worn but once
yearly—i. e., during Interscholastic
week) out of moth balls and sent
them to the cleaners,- but the boys
are practicing shoulder-high grips in
secret and reading Vanity Fair to
get that bored, sophisticated manner
that it is said to be essential to the
collegian (in the Vanity Fair sub-
scription bulls.

But this is not all. There is not
only a committee—there are COM-
MITTEES. There is, first of all, the
regular committee, with a man or so
in each campus fraternity house.

the St. Johns chances for the rest.	,

„ . .	r 1 Then there is the women s committee

Joey Ray s brother, also of Dela-

field, will uphold the family and
academy honors in the half mile.

Lake Forest has entered a sum
total of 23 men, among them being
Slavics in the sprints, Smith in the
weights, and Jensen in the hurdles.
The northsiders have shown up well
in all preliminary meets and should
offer mighty stiff opposition. While
the Lake Foresters will battle for
home honors, Rogers of Senn, state
champion in high hurdles and Ram-
sey, his team mate, who holds the rec-
ord for the state in the 1-4 mile, will
try to keep some of the honors in
this locality Beckmeyer of Carlysle,
Illinois, holds the same time in the
1-4 as the Senn entry so that some
more heavy competition is expected.

with a darker, more sinister purpose
than any of the others—one which
has not been outlined for campus
ears. Last of all, there is the
“committee of prominent men” (yes,
there are prominent men), founded
on the platform that ‘the school has
something to sell, therefore, we will
sell it’. Certainly all this is a no-
table display of efficiency. It ought,
one would think, to get the boys.

The Rushing Commission, how-
ever, believes in making things safe
—in not only doing things up brown,
but in frying them to a crisp. Hence
it has come out with a plantive de-
mand for still more rushers and rush-
ing. “We want,” said Messrs. Bill
Heitman and Jack Cusack yeterday,

Phi Pi Upsets Sigma
Nu for League Title

Phi Pi Phi pulled the big upset
of the Intramural tournament
when they walloped Sigma Nu,
University titleholders, yesterday
2 to 0 in the playoff for the league
championship. Kraft hurled bril-
liantly for the winners, fanning
twelve men and scoring the second
run with a clean hit. Sigma Nu
however played without their star
hurler, Bus Stevens. The Phi Psi
deserved to win for the tight field-
ing and ability to hit in the pinch-
es.

In the wind-up game for third
and fourth places in the whole
tournament Alpha Delta Phi de-
feated the Senators team 7 to 3.
In the second league championship
game the T. K. E. aggregation won
out over Phi Sigma Delta after a
close, hard struggle by a count of
5 ot 4.

scores of 22 1-2 and 13, respectively.

Sigma Nu, led by the powerful
hurling of Bus Stevens, annexed for
the third consecutive year, the play-
ground title of the University. The
final game was held in conjunction
with the Spring Carnival, and it was
a real championship battle, going to
Sigma Nu with a 1 to 0 score over

Have you met this guy?

He’s silent in classes, says nothing all .
day;

Though others may gossip that isn’t i
his way.

Close-lipped, tight-mouthed,
Everyone thinks

He's verbose as an oyster,
As glib as the sphinx.

He answers by gestures—mere shakes
of the head;

“A man of few words,” his friends
always said.

Yet this model of briefness

*—This new “Silent Cal”—

Breaks all talk records known

When he chins with his gal—
While I wait,

Hesitates,

And perspire,

And delay,
And still wait

For the phone.

Beginning on the first of
April , July. October, and Jan-
uary, we conduct a Special,
complete, intensive three-
months course in stenography
which is open to

COLLEGE
GRADUATES AND
UNDERGRADUATES
ONLY

Enrollments for this course
must be made before the open-
ing day—preferably some time
in advance, to be sure of a
place in the class.

Stenography opens the way
to independence, and is a very
great help in any position in
life. The ability to take short-
hand notes of lectures ser-
mons, conversations, and in
many other situations is a
great asset.

Where two steam locomotives formerly puffed and strained to pull a 360-ton freight train up the
Steep slope of Maltrata inclina, two electric locomotives haul a 6t>0 ton train with power to spare.

Electricity levels the Mountains

In Mexico, romantic land of pretty senoritas
and languorous minstrelsy, practical American
engineers have harnessed streams so that moun-
tains may be leveled.

The winding thirty-mile Maltrata incline on the
road from Vera Cruz to Mexico City is now elec-
trified. Ten electric locomotives replace twenty-
three steam engines. The electrics haul twice the
tonnage of the steam locomotives—and in half
the time, with obvious benefits to traveler, rail-
roader, and shipper.

The General Electric Com-
pany required but eighteen
months to electrify Mal-
trata incline—locomotives,
power plant, transmission
equipment complete. En-
gineering skill, backed by
vast manufacturing facil-
ities, has enabled G-E to
serve humanity in many
ways.

A series of G-E advertise-
ments showing what elec-
tricity is doing in many
fields will be sent on request.
Ask for booklet GEK-1.

Yet Maltrata is but an example of electrical
progress. For electricity is conquering the grades
of railroads and of industry alike, the world over.

Impressive, no doubt, but still modest when
compared with the possibilities of electricity in
years to come. And it remains for college-
trained men, with trained capacity for initiative
and leadership, to become ambassadors for fur-
ther electrical conquests in foreign lands.
