HOW DO YOU READ
LAUNDRY CHECKS?

How long would it take to read
a laundty check? Professor Walter
Miles of Leland Stanford Univer-
sity has ascertained by a series of
comprehensive tests that Chinese
can be read more rapidly than
English. The solution of this phe-
nomenon. he claims, is that Chin-
ese writing is .-ead vertically. Read-
ing in this manner produces less
nervous strain on the eyes. A hor-
izontal reading, such as is employed
with every language other than
Chinese, is harder on the eyes, and
thus can not be done as quickly.

However, the experiment

not intimately know Chinese,

U. S. Is in Midst of Industrial
Revolution Says New Clark Book

We are living in the midst of a
revolution which is transforming the
character of business, the economic
life and relations of every citizen, and
the powers and responsibilities of the
community toward business and of
business toward the community.
Changes are taking place so rapidly
that the revolution will assume to our
grand children the proportions in

which we

from a hundred years’ dis-

the opinion of John M,

Clark, professor of political economy
at the University in a forthcoming
book, "Social Control of Business” to
‘be pu'blishea by the University Press.
Pointing out that private business is
no longer private, as the phrase was
used a hundred years ago, Prof. Clark
asserts:

“It is sufficiently clear that industry
is essentially a matter of public con-
cern, and that the stake that the pub-
lic has in the process is not adequately
protected by the safeguards which in-
dividualism affords.

Winning by a hair's breadth will be
the record of Fred Handschy, editor
of the Phoenix, author of the Bimbles,
addict to several habits and an incom-
plete if “Doc” Bratfish does not de-
clare him ineligible in the develop-
ment campaign for senior mustaches
this month.

In his temporary confinement with
German measles Fred is using an
American mirror, a French pomade,
and a Russian curry-comb on his up-
per lip in an effort to cultivate his
retucent growth of what-have-you. An-
ticipating the pride of an Australian
'bushnian he has had a mustache cup
with his initials in gold, purchased for
his use during the two weeks of com-
petition. At present his mustache fits
very well although he wields the cup
awkwardly.

Direct from his triumph as director
of dancing for the annual productions
of the Haresfoot Club at Wisconsin
and the men’s dramatic organization at
Illinois, Archie Scott has come to the
University to stage dancing specialties
for the Blackfriar show, “Wallie
Watch Out,” to be presented in Man-
del hall May 14, 15, 21, and 22.

For the first time in the twenty-one
years of Friars history a special danc-
ing coach has been added to the di-
recting staff. Such a step puts Black-
friars on a par with such organiza-
tions as the Michigan Mimes, Prince-
ton Triangle and others. The engage-
ment of Mr. Scott, says Mr. Cole-
man. satisfies the long felt need for
a coach who can bring something new
in dancing to Blackfriars.

Mr. Scott, who is connected with
Schooleys, Inc., is considered the most
capable instructor in Chicago in his
field. Both in the Wisconsin and Il-
linois shows, he was in full charge of
the staging of all dances. For a num-
ber of years he has taken an active
part in the production of college shows
although a professional instructor. *

Mr. Scott is now busy with the pro-
duction of the Daguerreotype ensem-
ble, and with the dancing for the en-

of them are school songs, having been
written by men at the University.

The Glee Club will sing four groups
of songs and the rest of the program
will be devoted to specialties, such as
the singing of the University Quar-
tette and the solo work of Gilbert
Small and Alan Irwin, president of
the club.

The concert will commence at 8:00

DECADENCE

« JAKE,” we said, "write us an editorial.” But Jake said he was
* busy. As a matter of fact, he wasn’t; we could tell that. He
was just lazy. We turned to other members of the staff.

“Jerry,” we said, “how about an editorial?” Jerry had an ap-
pointment with his dean—another alibi that we have heard before.

“Sam,” we said, “you haven’t written us an editorial for quite
a while.” Sam would be glad to write one tomorrow, he said; but
he was stdying for a quiz today. We looked over his shoulder; he
was reading The American Mercury.

We asked others. We made the rounds of the staff, bent on
finding one man at least with some energy about him. We found
plenty of excuses,but no one to write an editorial. One man even
asked (without taking his feet off the table) why we didn’t write one
ourselves.

It is closing time, and no editorial written.

Yet that is not the worst of it. The worst lies in the future. This
same staff, this crew of idlers, will managge The Daily Maroon next
year. From among these good-for-nothings, too lazy even to write
editorials, we must elect our successor.

attempt to do what the football team
did to the Maroons last fall, when they
cross bats with the Maroons tomorrQw
on Greenwood Field. This being the
first home game for the Maroons, who
are a better team than they have
shown themselves to be thus far. the
Badgers will have plenty of trouble.
Baseball at Madison is undergoing a

transformation and
anxious to notch

High Pitch

As for the Maroons, buoyed up with
confidence as a result of their victory
over DePaul, feel ripe for their first
Conference win. It is certain that
they will not face a better pitcher
than Herb Maas, the former Lane
Tech ace, who hurled for DePaul.
Stoll, who will ascend the mound for
the visitors is a good pitcher, although
socked for ten hits by Northwestern.
The Badgers are not a heavy hitting
outfit, beating the Purple on five hits.
They are well versed in major leagut
strategy of making every hit count.

Marks To Hurl

Coach Norgren will send his star
right hander. Marks, to the rubber. If
Wallie is right and the weather is
“basebally" instead of fdotball weather
ashas been the case thus far, the
Maroons are favored to win. The lo-
cals are beginniag to hit the pill hard

FOR a long time sharkskin resisted all
efforts to adapt it to volume use in the
making of shoes. But the tanners have found
a way to strip off the outer armor-plate and
utilize the long-fibered pliable hide under-
neath.

It’s a rich-looking leather in light tan,
with a natural permanent grain unlike that
of any other leather known.

Because of its unusual toughness, its plia-
bility and water-repelling character, it is
peculiarly well fitted for use in golf shoes
and in street shoes that come in for extra
hard wear. The golf shoes have rubber soles.

THE ASTERISK

A writer owned an Asterisk
And kept it in his den,
Wheffe he wrote tales (which had
large sales)

Of frail and erring men;

And always, when he reached the point
Where carping censors lurk.

He called upon the Asterisk
To do his dirty work.

At first the gentle Asterisk
Would blush a rosy red.
But, soaked in sin, it soon rushed in
Where angels fear to tread; ... .

And reveled in the sort of scenes
That run along like this:
