WHATo/ II?

VG£Oa££JMOR£EN^

Precisely one week ago today, fresh-
ly returned from Champaign, where I
saw the Illinois-Iowa football game
and various phenomena of "college
life” peculiar to the Twin Cities, I
set down my week-end impressions of
what the boys far and wide factrously
term the Greatest State University.
The Daily Illini, some three days later,
after a mature investigation into my
column, and after reviewing it from
all angles, was seized with the horri-
ble suspicion that, possibly, there were
some dirty digs in it. Hence, the guid-
ing minds of the paper put their noses
to the grindstone anti did their best
in the editorial column of the Thurs-
day Illini in the way of refutation.

* ♦ *

One of the references in my column
which was strenuously objected to by
The Daily Illini was the describing of
the Illinois football team as an "out-
fit of hog-butchers.” The Daily Illini
saw something sinister in that, it fear-
ed that there was something ulterior
behind those apparently harmless
words. I wish, before going on, to
put The Illini at rest on this point.
The afternoon on which the column
under discussion was written had been
partially devoted to looking into some
of the poetry of Mr. Carl Sandburg
(has Hie Daily Illini ever heard of
him?). My using of the herm "hog-
butchers” was a natural enough out-
cropping of the afternoon’s casual pur-
suit. There was, let me hasten to re-
assure The Daily Illini, no innuendo in
it, no attempt to sneak up behind Mr.
Robert’s Zuppke’s estimable football
team and kick it in its collective pants.

* * *

The Daily Illini termed the "hog-
butchers” line—sardonically, I believe
-a “courteous and sportsmanlike ref-
erence.” It then went on in its own
inimitable fashion to return me and
Mr. Stagg’s football team a few
‘courteous and sportsmanlike” compli-
ments of its own. It ended up on the
implied note of “wait and see how
we’ll get even” in its closing line:
"November 6 is less than three weeks
away.” An ominous threat—but one
robbed somewhat of its sting by the
fact that in the column of mine under
discussion ] had admitted that it seem-
ed likely that the Maroons would be
beaten by three touchdowns in their
game with Illinois.

A recent official, publicity release of
the University of Illinois, sent out
just before the Iowa game, was to the
effect. . "Bob Zuppke’s worries
were increased today by a report that
Iowa has such a clever shift it was
impossible for the officials to . tell
whether or not the backs were in mo-
tion before the ball went into phy.
The Illinois coach immediately in-
structed the freshmen to get into mo-
tion before the ball was snapped, so
that the varsity players would be pre-
pared to break up an illegal shift if
they had to.” It seems a very preval-
ent worry in the Twin Cities to doubt
the “sportmanship” of other fellows.
Certainly the university, The Daily
Illini, and Mr. Zuppke show in this
the true spirit of “sportmanship” them-
selves.

I do not, however, condemn their
attitude as one morally wrong. When
m Champaign on my visit, I saw,
among other things, a “mugging party”
on the street, and amateur bootlegging
in one of the fraternity houses. At
the time, I did not condemn thes:
things—as Mr. Cross would—solely
becav|e they were morally wrong No;
I merely set them down as typical of
the spirit of the University of Ilinois
and its frequenters—as being in bad
taste. And that is my onlv a^swei
to Mr. Zuppke’s doubts and The Daily
Ulini’s threats as to what may na • en
November 6—they may not be
‘wrong,,’ but they certainly are not
m good taste.

Prominent Author

Frank Swinnerton, noted English
novelist and literary critic will de-
liver an address at the University
of Chicago, Thursday evening, Oct-
ober 28, on "Authors, their Friends
and Critics.” The talk will be one
of the 1926 William Vaughn
Moody series. No admission will
be charged but tickets must be ob-
tained from the office of the Presi-
dent.

Swinnerton is widely known as
the author of “Noctune,” “The

Y. W. DRIVE ENDS
SHORT OF QUOTA

Miriam Miller’s Team Leads
With $252

One thousand, two hundred and
thirty-seven dollars has been pledged
by the Y. W. C. A. in its Finance
Drive, according to Betsy Farwell,
Chairman of the Finance Committee.
The campaign was started Oct. 18
with the goal set for $1800. The wom-
en were divided into fifteen teams of
six each and the results show Miriam
Miller’s team in the lead with $252.
Following are the captains and their
scores: Miller $252. Brignail $133,
Donnelly $129, Stackhouse $108, Low
$85, Sheean $83, Williams $79, Allen
$77, Moulton $76, Oakes $68. Stoll $54,
Holmes $33, Taylor $32, Lamborn $19,
Bryan $6,

Since the quota has not been reach-
ed, the women are planning to con-
tinue their work though the drive will
not be extended. Appeals will be made
to the people who pledged last year.
Proceeds are to be used for the Y.
W. budget in hot# local and national
work. Besides supporting the Uni-
versity settlement, the Y. W. also car-
ries on work in China.

Elizabeth Garrison
Appointed Hostess
At W. A. A. Tea

Elizabeth Garrison who has presided
at a number of W. A. A. functions
will he hostess at the first W. A. A.
tea of the year open to all women' of
the University, Friday afternoon from
3:30 to 5:30 in the corrective gymnas-
ium at Ida Noyes. Immediately fol-
lowing the tea, at 5:30, the annual
Torch in Dudley Field will take place.
The women will sing songs and con-
duct a pep meeting of their own, if
plans do not materialize for an all-
University meeting before the game
with Ohio. Tickets for Torch will be
on sale for 25 cents until Friday from
all members.

Ticket sales for W. A. A. banquet
close tonight. All members have
been requested to purchase them im-
mediately.

“Poor Nut”Company Will Watch
Ohio Game;Furnishes Cheerleader

Elliott Nugent, leading man, and
numerous members from the cast of
“The Poor Nut,” which has been
showing for some time at the Cort
theater, will cast aside artificial Ohio
State enthusiasm and reassume the
genuine when they come en masse to
the game next Saturday afternoon.
Their presence at the game will not
be doubted when Percy Helton, who
goes through an extraordinary set of
gymnastics every night down at the
Cort, gets out again before the Ohio
stands as cheerleader. During the
“half” he will come over and test
Chicago on some of her own cheers.

The excellent acting in this play has
evidently been due not alone to abil-

REUNION 10 CALL
OVER SEVENTEEN
THOUSAND GRADS

Homecoming To Bring
Alumni From Entire

Country

When the whistle signalling the
kickoff in the Illinois-Chicago game,
November 6, blows 17,400 old grads-
will be in the stands celebrating the
second annual Homecoming of the
University.

On the Maroon sidelines 36,000 root-
ers will be urging the Staggmen on to
wipe out the bitter memory of the
13-6 fefeat last year, when the Cham-
paign boys drove through the slime
ami mud and rain for a victory.

Bearing the orange and blue. 12,000
Illini, still smarting from the sting
of the walloping admistered by Michi-
gan last Saturday, will combine their
efforts to add a strong moral support
to the much touted Illini eleven.

Even with a Penn game and a Pur-
due game in the past, (and anything
that might happen between now and
November 6) local rooters, strong in
the belief that Stagg has pointed for
the Illinois game, except a victory
over the State University.

But—Beat Illinois—is the campus
sentiment and Chicago spirit, often
dormant or subdued, is scheduled to
leap to the front on November 6, and
to defy the strains of “Hail to the
Orange” with “Wave the Flag for
Old Chicago.”

As for the others, Purdue, Penn,
Ohio. Northwestern,—well they don't
fall on Home coming and they are not
from Champaign—so it's—“Beat Illi-
nois.”

Third Season of
Allied Arts Inc.

Opens This Week

Chicago Allied Arts, Inc., is open-
ing its third season with a series of
three ballets at the Eighth Street
theater. The first of the series is be-
ing given on Tuesday, Wednesday,
Friday evenings, and Sunday after-
noon of this week, the second and
third in December and March.

The program this week will open
with “La Farce de Pont Neuf” intro-
ducing the entire company. Miss Ruth
Page, premiere danseuse, will dance
with Adolph Bolm, director of the bal-
let.

Single seats range from $3.00 to
$1.00, subscriptions for thethree pro-
grams from $7.50 to $2.50. Orders for
tickets may be left this week from 2
to 4 in Classics 16.

University students will be particu-
larly interested in this week’s perform-
ance as Mrs. Henry Holsman former-
ly Miss Lois Russell is appearing with
the ballet.

ity but to first hand experience since
the leading man and others with very
prominent parts are recent graduates
from Ohio State University. Elliott
Nugent is an Ohio Phi Psi.

Eliminate Afternoon Show

The afternoon performance, which
will be dropped on this account, will
be shifted to midnight. Ohio State
alumni have bought out this special
performance so as to reserve the thea-
tre entirely for football enthusiasts,
both from Ohio and from the Univer-
sity of Chicago. Reservations for this
special performance should be made
immediately at the Cort theatre. In
spite of the late hour, the play-goers
will find plenty of life.

Even Maps Can Be
Made of Air Now

Music, football scores and even
motion pictures have betn broad-
cast over the radio but three Uni-
versity scientists are doing some-
thing new. They are picking weath-
er maps right out of the air.

The Government station at Ar-
lington is sending out these maps
as a new development in the field
of climatology. The local station is
one of the few that are taking ad-
vantage of this new service.

Reception is yet far from per-
fect. Static has to date interfered
quite a bit and the wave length is
constantly being made shorter in an
attempt to eliminate this difficulty.

LAVISH SETTING
FOR HONOR HOP

Engage Entire Second Floor
of Shoreland

The entire second floor of the Shore-
land )Hotel will be turned over to the
merry-makers at the Score Club Dance
on Friday. As an added convenience,
a spacious lounge, all of the privtc
dining-rooms, and every check room
in the hotel will be at the disposal of
the guests. There will be accomda
tions so that every one may secure
as much or as little as he wishes to
eat during the evening.

Tn commenting on the dance, <
C. Harmon, president of the S: >'e
Ciub said: “We have chosen the
Shoreland Hotel on account of its
proximity to the campus, and its large
and beautiful ballroom. The fact that
the dance will be held the evening be-
fore the Ohio State game should add
pep and enthusiasm to the occasion.
We hope that the informality of the
dance will contribute to its popularity.”
“Tickets are now on sale at the
bookstore, and should be procured at
once,” says Ray Murphy. President of
Skull and Crescent.

Newman Unfolds

Theory of Twins

“Indentical” twins will be alike
whether separated or not, while “frat-
ernal” twins, reared in the same en-
vironment 'cannot be alike, according
to Prof. H. H. Newman of the Uni-
versity of Chicago who spoke Monday
afternoon at the First Congregational
Church, Oak Park.

Dr. Newman has devoted much
study to this subject and to the
question of the relative effects of en-
vironment and heredity which is best
studied in the case of twins. He con-
cludes that environment has small ef-
fect compared to heredity and that
“identical” twin or those from a single
egg, will be alike if normal, and that
“fraternal” twins, or those coming
from separate eggs normally will bear
no more resemblance than ordinary
brothers and sisters.

Professor Newman is the author of
a book called “Evolution, Eugenics
and Genetics,” which is used as a text
in the course of the same name.

Final plans have been made for the
Annual Freshman Frolic which will
be held Thursday evening from 7 to

Although it is against the policy of
the University to hold parties on week-
nights, Mrs. Robert V. Merrill, social
director, has made this party an ex-
ception since the Score Club dance is
Friday night. The Frolic had to be

Tryouts for the University debating
team which will meet the University of

will be held in Harper Assembly hall
both today and tomorrow due to the
large number of candidates.

In this debate and in the one with
the University of California on Jan-
uary 24, the Oxford style of debate
will be used. This method of debate,
according to Assistant-Professor E. A.
Burtt who has charge of University
debating, is informal in comparison to
the old type. Witty repartee is only
one of its interesting features.

This tea will be one of a series of
six to be given by this committee on
successive Wednesday afternoons. Fif-
ty of the 300 Freshman women will be

With Vice-president Charles G.
Dawes presenting Dwight W. Morrow
of J. P. Morgan and Company, the

American Meat Packers. Mr. Mor-
row, the first speaker of the afternoon
session, will discuss the outlook for
finance during the coming year.

The Conference, which is in t. c
nature of a forum for the discussion
of vital business problems, is to be
addressed by leaders of several great
American industries. In addition to
Mr. Morrow, W. S. Farish, president
of the American Petroleum Institute
will analyze the oil industry and the
principles underlying it; tne automo-

MR. F. J. GURNEY, the Assistant Recorder, has put into words a
feeling which has been growing in us during the last two weeks.

We quote his letter:

“On returning from a somewhat belated vacation a few days
ago, I looked about the campus with interest to see what progress
had been made on the new buildings, how the lawn looked, etc., and
to enjoy once more the beauty of our City Gray. All these things
and many others were pleasant to look at, but then my eye fell upon
those ugly daubs of green paint on the walk in front of Cobb Hall
and the walk around the Circle. Whether there are similar disfigure*
ments elsewhere I have not yet seen. Who could have been so gross
and boorish as to be guilty of this contemptible offense? This, alas,
is an instance showing how the good is at the mercy of the bad, the
fine and beautiful at the mercy of the sneaking and mean, the virtu-
ous at the mercy of the vicious. During the third of a century that
I have been in the University I don’t recall more than one such act
of vandalism and that was not as bad as this. In an address to the
students in the very early days President Emeritus Judson, then
Dean of the Junior Colleges, said that fortunately the University
had no traditions which required students to make rowdies of them-
selves. This has been true both as regards marring of buildings and
grounds and that relic of barbarism—hazing. We have lived in this
fine tradition of restraint with extremely little exception through
the years.

“I hope that those who are guilty of this contemptible deed
will see these lines, and will for a long time feel as uncomfortable
as an awakened conscience and keen self-reproach can make them—
presuming that they are after all capable of such an experience.”

The Alpha Sigs gave an informal

High Cost of Living

Felt at College

Gone are the days of those fortun-
ates who “went through college for
three hundred dollars.” We now must
pay more than twice as much for
things needed at school. Text books
themselves are good examples of high
cost of living on the campus. Meals
are purchased at prices that formerly
would include practically everything.

The increase in prices is in accord
with corresponding increases of cost
of other commodities.

STAGG BEGINS WEEK’S DRILL

BY GIVING TEAM NEW PLAYS

TO BE USED AGAINST INVADERS

Anderson, Star of Purdue Game, Though Injured Will
Be Able To Play Saturday; Passing
Stressed

By William Pretschold

Michigan, Ohio State, Northwestern
and Wisconsin still remain as Big Ten
title contenders. All of these teams
played in convincing fashion Saturday.

Ohio State, with Coach Wilce’s
pet forward ksscs in evidence, as well
as Freddie Grata’s sparkling runs, dis-
played plenty of power in its victory
over Iowa. The Buckeyes appear to
have a good season ahead of them for
they showed but few ragged spots in
this contest. Last week against Co-
lumbia the Wilcemen didn’t show a
very smooth running attack, but Iowa
can testify that it has been polished
up considerably. Cowboy Kutsch, the
Hawkeye backfield ace, got off to a
few good runs but the speed with
which Ohio got to him time and again
kept him from making any of the
kind that made him famous in 1925.

Coach Yost proved something or
other when the Michigan team that
he was moaning about last week pro-
ceeded to show Illinois and the Con-
ference in general that it must be reck-
oned with considerably this year. The
Illini took the short end of a 13 to 0
score, but that score doesn’t tell just
what kind of a game was played at
Ann Arbor. The Maize and Blue won
only after one of the greatest struggles
in the history of Michigan-Illinois re-
lations. Capt. Friedman and Molenda
starred as usual for the Wolverines,
while Capt. Kassel showed up as the
shining light of Illinois. Frosty Pe-
ters, widely heralded Illini sophomore,

TEAMS IN DRILL

With the first game of the tourna-
ment series only one week distant,
candidates for the respective women’s
hockey teams are engaged in keen
competition for team positions. The
freshmen will oppose the seniors and
the sophomores will play against the
juniors in the first tournament games,
Tues’day, Nov. 2, on the Midway.

Intensive coaching on dribbling,
flicking and passing of the ball, which
occupied the major part of the practice
sessions for the first two weeks, end-
ed week before last. Since then, prac-
tice games have been played, with
the coaches interrupting frequently to
correct errors.

Only twenty-one women are out for
the freshman team. Contrasted with
the scores that have heretofore tried
for the green team, the number seems
small. The seniors lack one of hav-
ing enough members to compose a
team. The situation among the soph-
omores and juniors is more promis-
ing.	.

The remaining schedule of games is
as follows:

Nox. 4, 2:40, Fr. vs. Jr., So. vs. Sr.

Nov 10, 2:40, Fr. vs. So., Jr. vs. Sr.

Nov. 13, 10, Fr. vs. Sr., 11, S. vs. Fr.

Survivors of yesterday’s matches in-
tent upon the championship of their
respective circuits will make competi-
tion more interesting as they resume
matches tomorrow. Delta Chi-Beta
Theta Pi, Kappa Sigma-Kappa Nu,
and Phi Gamma Delta-Tau Sigma
Omicron matches promise to be the
fetaure of the afternoon. The close
scores and. exceptional caliber dis-
played by the various teams in the
tournament should point to a big cli-
max when the intra-league games
near.

READY FOR GRIND

tra Entrees for the Intramural Cross
Country Run closes Tuesday, October
26. The closing date is made early to
enable the entrants to start training
immediately and to allow the manager,
Harry Ault, to keep in touch with the
men. The|e is a large group out daily
under the supervision of Coach Stagg.
Anyone is eligible to this class and
needs only to see Harry Ault to start
training immediately. Every one is
showing a large amount of interest
and there are already twenty-five or-
ganizations registered.

This year it is necessary for three
men from each team to finish in order
to get any participation points. This
rule is different from the one of last
year which required only three men to
enter and not specifying that they
should finish.

With the promise of new plays to
use against Ohio State the Maroons
lashed viciously into the first practice
of the week. Tackling and passing
which was weak Saturday constituted
the main part of last night’s drill.

Coach Stagg seems to be of the
opinion that with a good deal of iron-
ing out and the acquisition of a few
new tricks his team will stand a chance
of furnishing the spectators of the
Ohio game next Saturday with many
thrills. The game is going to be an
especially tough one because of Ohio’s
dangerous running attack. Chicago’s
ends will need a great deal of polishing
up to prevent them from being pushed
out of the plays as they were in the
Purdue game. The backs will have to

know where the holes
to cut in on time if
make any gains.

Purdue showed a wonderful attack
and had a hard driving line. Their
play was characterized by a snap
drive, and shiftiness which was hard
to fathom. The Maroon team was en-
tirely baffled during the earlier part
of the game but during the second half'
found themselves and played a good
brand of football. K. Rouse, Ander-
son, and Wolff distinguished them-
selves and the coaches seemed pleased
with their showing.

After waiting for many long years,
Purdue finally took a wallop at Chi-

of a 6 to 0 score. The Maroons,

minus

the services of McKinney, and a few
other injured stalwarts, showed noth-

thirsting for a victory after all the
