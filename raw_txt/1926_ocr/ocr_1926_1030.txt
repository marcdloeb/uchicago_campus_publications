^DOPE FAVORS BUCKEYE TEAM

fy&o&l^temHONOR WALTER CAMP TODAY INJURIES CRIPPLE MIDWAY

I have an idea about All-Confer-
ence teams that, by those who take
their All-Conference as real and
earnest business, cannot be passed by
without some consideration. Almost
all of the “all ” teams picked since
Noah cut his squad down to the noble
six hundred he wanted to have on
the bench with him on the Ark have,
admittedly, been so much of what
the boys commonly call “hoy.” The
players on them have, as a rule, been
those with the best press agents.
Most of the “experts” who do the
choosing see the men that they pick
on their teams play in but one game;
frequently other players who do not
happen to stand out in that particu-
lar game have a better average over
the year. Often, too, the experts take
their men for political reasons, pick-
ing players from the traditional un-
derdog teams—a means of getting
a reputation for fair-mindedness
easily.

*	*	*	*

It is a customary procedure, also,
for the experts to pick on their teams
players who have ended up the year
with a bang-up final game. The im-
pression of this final performance is,
naturally enough, fresh in the ex-
perts’ minds when they get down to
the business of figuring out their
teams, so the player gets on. My idea
for a better “all-” team springs to
some extent from this habit of the
experts. Its basic principle lies in
the theory that the boys who do the
picking can do it most judiciously
immediately after every game, just
as they can and do pick the big stars
of the final games unerringly. So,
carrying out my idea to its logical
conclusion,—if anything having to
do with an “all-” team can be called
logical—there would be, here in the
Big Ten, an All-Conference team
picked every week.

* * * *

At the end of the season, the
expert doing the selecting would
average up his weekly teams, and
the men who have got on the most
times at their positions through the
season would be picked for the final
all-season team. Some latitude could
be given to injured players, who
might miss a game or two, in making
the selections, and in such cases
judgment wold not have to follow
strictly on the number of times the
man was placed on the weekly team.
I should suggest, to anyone who
wants to put the new system on
trial, that points on the same system
as those given in the decathlon (i. e.,
three for first, two for second, and
one for third) be given weekly to
the players, according to whether
they make the first, second, or third
team. The man with the highest
score at each position at the end of
the season would win the place
there.

On last week’s operations, I would
pick this outfit:

E Oosterbaan, Michigan
T Baer, Micihgan
G Hess, Ohio
C Klein,Ohio
G Lovette, Michigan
T Nelson, Iowa
E Kassell, Illinois
Q Friedman, Michigan
H Grim, Ohio
H Wilcox, Purdue
F Joesting, Minnesota

After looking it over, however, I
come back to the realization that an
"all-” team’s an “all-” team, no mat-
ter how good the system it’s picked
under.

LEADS STRONG TEAM

Captain Marty Karow, wearing
number 13, will bear watching today
both by the Maroon Team and by fans
who love good football. He is a lipe-
bucker, line-backer, and interference
maker of “All-Conference” rank.

KID TEAMS PLAY
BETWEEN HALVES

Midgets Meet Scouts In
Memory of Camp

As part of Walter Camp Day, the
annual Kid football game will be
staged this afternoon immediately
preceding and following the Ohio
State-Chicago conference game. This
contest, which has proved so popular
with the crowds in former years, is to
be between the Midway Midgets, a
team averaging ten years of age, and
the Shore Sport Scouts, who average
one year less.

The Midgets are relying on Buddy
Sherer, who will wear number 55,
Captain Marks’ numbers, and who
evidently has not a little of the Ma-
roon captain’s skill. Eddie Burke is
expected to furnish the Scouts’ threat
and, although only eight years old,
shows signs of becoming as elusive
and fast as the representative of the
number he will wear, Grange’s old 77.

The uniforms of the Scouts’ resem-
ble somewhat those of Ohio crimson

Rudolph Leyers

Rudolph Leyers began his football
career at Lindblom high school. He
was a regular in his senior year, but
did not star. He came out for fresh-
man football at the University and
was singled out for his defensive abil-
ity and was used to back up the line
in scrimmages with the varsity.

In spring practice, Coach Stagg, ap-
preciating the scarcity of fullbacks,
taught him to carry the ball. Daily
scrimmages developed him rapidly and
he learned much. After the close of
school, he caught pneumonia and
lost twenty-five pounds. It was
thought that he could not come back,
but he has shown up well recently.
He is a member of Alpha Sigma Phi.

DEDICATE GAME
TO MEMORY OF
FOOTBALL DEAN

Part of Receipts Devoted to
Finance Memorial for

Famed Yale Athlete

By Milton S. Mayer

There will be one victory on Stagg
field today, regardless of who wins the
football game—a victory for the mem-
ory of the greatest spirit that ever
built football, the greatest force that
ever moved football—Walter Camp.

The Colossus to whom Chicago and
Ohio sportdom bow their heads this
afternoon left upon his death a trail
of glory that demanded a memorial
from his Alma mater—one Yale uni-
versity. When Yale announced its
plans for the Walter Camp memorial,
the cry of country-wide protest de-
manded a share in the. business, and
Yale university gracefully raid yes.
And so this game is dedicated to Wal-
ter Camp. And the midget game to
follow is a tribute to Walter Camp’s
interest in boys.

Played At Yale

Camp was a 3-sport man at old Eli
in ’87, when bricks were footballs fist-
ing was legitimate, and pads were nix.
In ’89 he selected the first All-Ameri-
can football team, with his lifelong
friend, Amos Alonzo Stagg, thence-
forth around these parts, holding down
one wing.

For many years Camp was editor
of the official football guide and chair-
man of the football rules committee.
Among other things Camp was the
head of a New England clock foundry.

CHICAGO BAND TO
PLAY, SING, ACT

“FLAG OF MAROON” ।

An innovation in band maneuvers,
one that was postponed from last Sat-
urday, will be the formation of a flag
by the University band between halves
of the game today in order to intro-
duce effectually the song “Flag of Ma-
roons.”

As the band ends the march around
the field, it will form the flag in front
of the Chicago stands, and the mem-
bers will play the song once, sing it
the second time, and play it the third
time through.

In competition with the University
band, a musical aggregation of 120
pieces will accompany the Usiversity
of Ohio gridders, and will march be-
fore the game.

Elliot Fulton

Elliot Fulton preped at U High,
but did not play football until he came
to the University. He is a junior
now and played his first game vs.
Maryland. He first saw real service
last Saturday, however, when McDon-
ough was injured and he was substi-
tuted at quarter.

Coach Stagg Jr. says of him that he
has developed wonderfully since com-
ing to the University and is putting
his best into the game. If you see a
player with a big “13” on his back
calling plays today, you’ll know Ful-
ton’s getting another chance. He is
affiliated with Alpha Delta Phi.

(To Be Continued)

Marek, Last Year’s
Hero, on Sidelines

With Injured Hand

Marek, the halfback who tore
through Chicago’s tackles for re-
peated gains last year, will not be
in the opening lineup of today’s bat-
tle. He injured his left hand in the
Iowa game
doubtful if
coaches will
him today.

He has

last week and it is

hampered consid-
erably by injuries
this season. He
was bothered
with an injured
shoulder up to
the Columbia
game and last
week just he was
again in condtion
he hurt his hand.

He is one of Wilce’s three fleet-
foots, the other two being Grim and
Eby, sophomores. Grim has been
doing the bulk of the work lately,
although Marek and Eby starred
in early season triumphs.

Marek hails from Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, where both corn and athletes
grow. He played with Yeisley, who
was an end here last season, and
j with Murrel, ho is starring with
Army now and who played with
Minnesota last fall.

briskness of this morning’s sale, but
that he expected a crowd of from 43,-
000 to 46,000. Monday will see the
end of the ticket sales for the Wis-

RUNNING ATTACK; WILCEMEN
BOAST REAL SCORING POWER

Visitors Boast 35 Point
Average; Stagg Shifts

Backfield

By Victor Roterus

Before 43,000 fans, the largest
crowd to ever wend its way into Stagg
field, the Ohio State team, said to be
reminiscent of the day of Stinchcomb
and Harley, is expected to beat the
Maroons in almost as handy fashion,
as did Penn. At tough battle is hoped
for, but a romp is predicted.

Since 1920, the opening of football
relations between the two teams, both
teams have won two, lost two, and tied
two. The last two games ended in
3-3 ties. So something or other will
be decided today when the teams clash
again.

Injuries Are Bad

The last pre-game statement issued
from Benson’s training quarters was
that McKinney, fleet halfback, would
be ready to play in case Stagg needs
him, and that Anderson’s knee injury
is so grave that there would not be
much use in playing him. McKinney’s
back still bothers him, and he would
be risking permanent injury by play-
ing. Otherwise the team is fit. Lewis,
tackle who was not in uniform for the
Purdue game, will start. Greenebaum’s
showing this week has entitled him to
a place on the opening lineup although
Neff will undoubtedly be given a
chance.

The injuries of McKinney and An-
derson have necessitated a change in
the backfield. Capt. Marks has been
shifted to halfback while Leyers, stoc-
ky sophomore, will appear in Marks’
old position at full. This strengthens
the line plunging but weakens the

FANS IN CHEERING

Percy Helton, star of “The Poor

lead the Ohioans in cheers during the
game. At the half he will take Wil-
liam Weddell’s place as Chicago
cheer-leader.

Mr. Nugent, leading man, Mr. Hel-
ton and cast, will have lunch at the
Beta house, and dinner at the Phi Psi
house. Mr. Nugent was a Phi Psi at
Ohio.

The regular performance of the
“Poor Nut” tonight will be for the
benefit of the Ohio alumni. There
will also be a midinght performance
for the students.

New Grid Rules for Good of Game
Says Stagg—Explains Purposes

/ By Hugh O. Potter

After giving the new five yards
penalty rule on each incompleted pass
after the first during the same series
of four downs and, the also infantile,
two hours-a-day practice edict, a fair
trial, A. A. Stagg, dean of American
football coaches, is of the opinion that
they are for the good of the game.

“The purpose of the pass ruling is
to justly penalize teams that use the
pass excessively,” he explained. “The
people don’t want football to be turned
into basketball.”

“The rule has been misinterpreted
by most people. It is not to stop pass-
ing but merely to keep it from being
over used. A five yards penalty isn’t

FROSH SCHOOLED
IN TRICK PLAYS

Homecomers See Game
Friday Afternoon

When Freshman meet Freshmen
next Friday afternoon for the Home-
comers, they will have a variety of
plays that will include the brain childs
of the pick of the country’s coaches.

Coach Huntington has spent the
season schooling the new men in Penn,
Maryland and Ohio plays and yester-
day began the round of Northwestern
and Illinois shifts. With a mixture of
the East and West and a sprinkling
of miscellaneous tricks, the Frosh will
be able to put on an interesting game,
according to their coach.

The squads have not been picked
yet, but selections will be made Mon-
day and the men will work together
as separate teams for a few days.
Coach Huntington will try to use all
of the players who have shown any
promise at all during the season in
Friday’s game.

The Freshman game will be played
off following the touch football games
also a part of the Homecoming pro-
gram.

much or even a ten yard penalty, the
most that can be given, doesn’t hurt
a team, for it can always kick,” the
‘Old Man’ further said.

In speaking of the two hours’ prac-
tice rule Mr. Stagg said, “The purpose
of this ruling is to develop uniformity
among teams. Two hours is long
enough. It also emphasizes the fact
that scholarship is the main purpose
of the university and not football.”

Mr. Staggs is one of the thirteen
outstanding football coaches and cri-
tics of the gridiron game who compose
the National Football Rules commit-
tee. Among the other twelve the more
prominent are: Tad Jones, of Yale;
William Roper, of Princeton; and E.
K. Hall of Dartmouth.

“THE OLD MAN”

«|T does not worry me to have criticism from the press and from
“ the undergraduates,” said the “Old Man” at the annual foot-
ball banquet, “but it does make a fellow feel good to have the con-
fidence of men—confidence that he is able and competent.”

These words from a man who has become gray in the service of
Maroon athletics is a fitting comment on all “smart” undergraduates.
Four hundred alumni voiced their faith in the “Old Man” with pro-
longed cheers and stamping of feet. And yet it remains for the un-
dergraduate body to hiss the “seven plays” that the Metropolitan
presses ridicule.

Stagg is no miracle man but he is as near one as it is possible to
get. The “smart” undergraduate is no Judas but he is as near one
as it is possible to get. To talk against the greatest mentor that Uni-
versity athletics has ever seen is o betray the confidence of years of
faithful service. It is despicable that the alumni must prove them-
selves the truest men.

Talk against the “Old Man” and the team has done one thing.
It has solidified the spirit of the undergraduate leaders. Never again
will there be condemnation from the men who make undergraduate
history.

After all we are proud of A. A. Stagg, of our seven plays, of our
green linemen. And we say, in a paraphrase, “may our team in her
contests with other teams always be victor, but our team win or lose.”

And if undergraduates get the idea and the “Old Man” gets the
idea, then the team gets the idea, and the “March of the Maroons”
becomes history, not fiction.

“OUR SENTIMENTS”

A FTER climbing through the newspaper boys and souvenir peddlers
** encircling Stagg field on Saturdays, we expect to be at least rea-*
sonably free from irritating circumstances after we have bounced
down into our seats in the brand new stadium of the University.

Last Saturday while Purdue raced toward its touchdown in the
opening quarter, a member of the unwelcome element on the Chi-
cago side of the field produced a side show to the contest on the grid-
iron by berating the “Old Man” and his team with catcalls and epi-
thets.

The crowd at first satisfied itself with the proverbial “dirty
look.” But the “dirty look” idea did not get across, and a general
chorus of “sit down” and “pipe down” was necessary to still the in-
dividual. We were close enough to the gentlemen to ascertain that
he did not have a seat and was evidently in the employ of either the
stadium or the concession company and that he had come up dur-
ing a lull in business.

We don’t care if they sell hot dogs downstairs or not, be-
cause we couldn’t get one last week between halves; and as one in-
dividual remarked, “Why don’t they get the hell out of the place
if they don’t like the game.” And as we elbowed our way through
the bargains in souvenirs, wethought, “them is our sentiments, too.”

BADGER-GOPHERS
MIX IT UP TODAY

(Continued from page 1)
State Normal and Carroll College,
respectively.

With the Badgers recovering from
an early season slump, combined with
the fact that Dad’s Day is being cele-
brated on the Wisconsin campus, and
that Minnesota has won fifteen and
tied five of the thirty-four annual
combats, a real football game will be
fought at the Camp Randall stadium.
Minnesota, although losing to Mich-
igan by a 20-0 score two weeks ago,
has won her two other games, and
sports writers agree that the present
team is the strongest that has repre-
sented the University in the past
three years. The Gopher ariel attack
that was stopped by Notre Dame and
Michigan, but which was so effective
against North Dakota and Wabash,
is expected to cause serious worry-

ing on the part of the Cardinals.

Northwestern, playing stellar foot-
ball, defeated Indiana 20-0 two weeks
ago, after being held scoreless for
the first three quarters. Indiana,
playing on its own field, and knowing
Capt. Baker’s team well, aims to up-
set the dope and make the team
sporting the purple play a marvelous
game in order to win.

Illinois, after a defeat by Michi-
gan las't week at Ann Arbor, seems
doomed to suffer another taste of
the same medicine when the orange
and blue warriors plays a game of
“Button, Button,” with Coach
Young’s aggregation from Pennsyl-
vania. The game will undoubtedly
be a hard fought affray with sopho-
more quarterbacks opposing each
other, Murphy for Penn and Lanum
for the Illini. “Fighting Bob” Reich
is one of the men expected to stop
the hidden plays directed at the cen-
ter position. Capt. Kassel and D’Am-
brosio will stop all end plays, while

built that they combine smartness of design with the
corrective features of scientific construction. If you give
one pair a tryout—and they are obtainable at the Store
for Men only—you’ll be a Comfopedic customer for cer-
tain. The style shown is available in both black and tan
calfskin as well as tan Scotch grain. The price is ^10.50.

(Continued from page 1)
He died in New York in 1924, a vic-

Few Maroon All-Americans

Camp was never too generous with
his all-American berths around here.
Herschbergen ’98, Eckersall, ’03, .04,
'05, Steffen, ’07, McGuire. ’21, and
John Thomas, ’22, were the only Ma-

roon lads to win the apparently cov-
eted positions on first string outfit.
Norgren, ’12, ’13, and Fritz Crisler,
’21, raked second team jobs out of
Mr. Camp’s athletic coals.

Coach Stagg’s disapproval of all-
star teams, and his refusal to cooper-
ate with Camp’s little annual ruckus
have long been cited as the reason for
Chicago’s poor all-American showing.
And this may (or may not) be true.
Just as Ohio may ( or may not) win
today.

HE chances are, everything else being equal, that the
neatly typewritten report or thesis will be marked higher
than hand-written work. The profs, like every one else,
appreciate clearly legible work, and unconsciously it creates a
better impression.

The Remington Portable is always ready to help you get the
best marks you can. It is the simplest, fastest, and easiest to

be put away in a drawer when not in use. All these features
plus the four-row standard keyboard.

A FOOTBALL TRAGEDY

A football Star (whose name I’ve not
recalled)

Was loved long, long ago by three
fair girls,

Each of such sweet grace that all
who saw them stood en*
thralled

And marvelled at the redness of
their lips against the cheeks
as white as pearls.

They all were beautiful to see,....
but all in different ways,

For one had hair as yellow as the
fields of corn that sway be-
neath an autumn breeze.

The Second's locks were of a titian
hue.... gold-shaded in the
sunlight’s rays.

The last’s were rippled black as night
upon some strangely quiet seas.

You’d think this football player was
a fool

If, having three such beauteous crea-
tures at his beek and call,

He chose not even one. . . . but not a
one he did, and with a gusto
that was cruel

(As these three girls still tell) de-
serted not just one....but
all!

They’d called one day to see how he
was feeling—he’d hurt his leg
the week before—

But when they reached his door the
butler turned them back with-
out a forewarned reason,

And only said, (the ruse was open to
its very core)

“My Master’s out now for the bal-
ance of the season!”

WE NOTE with enthusiasm that
Ohio expects to win the Big Ten
Championship this year. At least af-
ter it is all over ,and we are look-
ing back at the present football sea-
son from the coziness of a fraternity
house living room, maybe we will be
able to swell our chests and say,
“Well, they had to beat US before
they could wear those gold footballs
on their watch chains!” T^at is the

most optimistic way to regard what
is probably going to happen this af-
ternoon.

The Illinois Men Were Stalling Time
So That Benny Freidman Would

Have No Kick Coming

Dear GeoG:

At the Michigan-Illinois game last
year I was accompanied by my
younger brother, who had never
seen a football game before. Al-
though much enthused before the
opening kick-off, he lost his usual
smile after the first few plays and
for a whole quarter a deep frown
shadowed his forehead. Finally, just
as the second quarter started, he
rose in his seat and, pointing to the
eleven Illinois players grouped to-
gether in the huddle they had been
using all through the first quarter,
exclaimed,

“Look, Sister....Is that the rea-
son they call this a Conference
game!”

—E.

Have been warning for fifteen years

That, unless she takes physical cul-

There isn’t a chance that she’ll last.

Now Gertrude justs hates all gym-
nastics

And can’t stand to wear bloomers

So, for her health (though she does
no athletics)

She wisely goes in for athletes!

WHILE punning, we might as well
mention the fact that the Ohio play-
ers’ names offer especially golden
opportunities. Take this sentence:
“If we don’t take KAROWhio MAR-
EK us ere we’re aware of the GRIM
misfortune.”

So far the Buckeyes have traveled

went to the University of Chicago so
the story wouldn’t interest you.

—DoDo

WELL ANYHOW we know one
fellow who lost twenty-five dollars on
last week’s game, and now is betting
thirty dollars more on today’s game.

big University doesn’t affect a per-

Iowa and Columbia. It is evident that
the visitors have something in the
way of an offense. Although they iiave
three splendid ball-carriers in Marek,
Eby and Grim, Ohio plays them but
one at a time. While he is in the
game he does practically all the run-
ning with the remainder of the back-
field running interference. Capt. Kar-
ow besides being an excellent blocker
is a vicious lise smasher. Clark and
Kraskamp are to Grim what McIlwain
and Britton were to Grange. Marek
has an injured left hand, but he will be
able to play.

Hess is Ohio’s outstanding star on
the line, although Raskowski, sopho-
more giant, is receiving favorable com-
ments from the critics for his work
in the Columbia and Iowa games. The
two lines are about even in weight,
while the Marons have the weight ad-
vantage in the backfield.

Both teams topped off the week’s
drill yesterday afternoon on Stagg field
with signal and kicking practice.

ARMY-NAVY CADETS

PARADE AT GAME

Major Barrows, head of the Univer-

received a bulletin today from the
West Pointer’s association, announc-
ing the plans of the Cadets for this
year’s Army-Navy football game.

The cadets will arrive in Chicago
Friday morning, November 27, and
will go directly to tjje LaSalle hotel.
In the afternoon they will parade, un-
der arms, from LaSalle street to the
Soldiers Field, there they will be re-
leased from all duty until Saturday af-
ternoon. At that time they will report
at Grant Park and again march to
Soldiers Field the scene of this year s
Army-Navy football game. The Ca-
dets will prepare to return to West
Point immediately after the game

THE SECRET

OF HIGHER GRADES

Woodworth’s Book Store Gives Facts and Figures Derived from
Daily Contact With Both Faculty and Students

Ask an educator “What is the
secret of higher marks and better
progress in school?”

His answer will be: “Make work
interesting and easy.”

It’s not such a hard thing to
do! Give the student a typewriter.

Writing is work—real drudg-
ery, for most people.

Typewriting is fun. There is a
pleasure in seeing the words ap-
pear clear, clean and sharp on the
paper; in watching them dance off
the keys—almost automatically!
—at the tap of your fingers.

The student who uses a type-
writer is sure to do better work—

Because type notes are apt to
be more complete and accurate
than written ones;

Because the legibility of type-
written notes helps the student to
review them frequently and
easily;

Because typewriting becomes

automatic, thereby freeing
mind of bothersome detail,
promoting concentration;

and chiefly,

the
and

Because typewriting is clear
writing, and leads to clear think-

ing—which is the basis of all good
work.

Suppose you were an instructor,
and daily had to read scores, per-
haps hundreds of papers—

Each one of them scrawled in a
handwriting either cramped or
sprawling or anular or micros-
copic, but almost always illegible;

Wouldn’t you smile with relief
when there came to your hand a
paper not written but typed; a
paper easily read and clearly un-
derstood.

We sell and rent all makes of
typewriters. See us first when
you want a typewriter. We can
give you just what you want and
save you money. We are author-
ized agents for Corona, Reming-
ton, Underwood, L. C. Smith, and
for officially rebuilt Royals,
Woodstocks, Olivers, and Ham-
monds. All our rebuilt machines
are completely overhauled, all
worn parts replaced, and are fully
guaranteed for one year.

We take your old machine in
trade. We can arrange easy pay-
ments. Come in and choose one
