Undergraduate Council

1.	Lucy Lamon and Catharine
Campbell reported on the progress of
the preparations for the 1926 Wash-
ington Prom, to be held Feb. 19 from
9 to 1 at the South Shore Coq^try
Club.

2.	Graham Hagey and Aimee Gra-
ham reported on the preparations for
the president’s reception, to be held
Feb. 12 at 7:30 tn Mandel Hall and
Hutchinson Commons.

3.	Catharine Campbell made a re-
port relative to the recent agitation
for a change in the method of en-
forcing physical culture on Qpmpus
women.

5. Acting on a suggestion by one
of its members, the entire counci'
voted to have the picture of the body
in the Cap and Gown a composite
and not a group photograph. The
class councils will be similarly repre-
sented.

6. Five students were selected to
compose the new Executive council
of the “All For Chicago” campaign.

Three men and two women were
selected at the Undergraduate Coun-
cil of ‘All For Chicago” drive. Ellen
McCracken and Catharine Campbell
are the women; Allan Miller, Archie
Trebow and Allen Heald are the men.

The new committee wil’ look over
and sort the suggestions and criti-
cisms handed in by the members of
the graduating class in the chapel
poll and will decide what steps are to
be taken. According to Charles An-
derson, president of the Undergrad-
uate council, they will begin work
immediately.

Student Suggest* Garage

New criticisms have come to the'
attention of the Editor of The Daily
Maroon since the excerpts were
printed last week. One student sug-
gests that the University might build
a large garage in which the students
might rent parking space, thus elim-
inating much of the congestion about
the quadrangles. The same writer
suggests that a department of music
would greatly enhance the campus.

Suggestions such as the improving
of the quality of the beans in the
commons, reducing the charges in-
curred by the buildings and grounds
were among those submitted. One
student suggested in strenuous tones
that final exams be supplanted by
term papers and short periodical
tests.

COMMITTEE GIVES

OBJECT OF DRIVE

“A foundation of European peace
is being laid through the medium of
the Student friendship association,”
said Jeanette Hayward, co-chairman
of the Student Friendship drive of
Y. W. C. A., “when it helps students
of all the countries to meet together
in school life, as the reconstruction
of the European educational system
is permitting them to do.”

The students in foreign countries
are associating without reservation
and without national prejudice on a
give-and-take basis with an open-
mindedness ready to see both sides
of every question. “The students of
America may feel proud when they
realize that this reconst ’uction of
Europe’s younger generation is being
effected in part by an American or-
ganization, though they are helping
to bring about one of the greatest
world changes e^er made,” Miss Hay-
ward continued.

Doc Bratfish Says
He’s Been Cheated

“Doc” Bratfish, the man who
is responsible for many self-con-
scious looks and cold necks around
campus, is thoroughly disgusted
with the hunt for the campus
Apollo, he asserts. The main
reason for this is that, although
at the beginning of the hunt every-
one on campus was declared elig-
ible, someone has been holding opt
on him and keeping back his votes.

When quest’med “Doc” very re-
luctantly gave a description of the
person whom he considers the
second best looking man on cam-
pus. “This person very closely
resembles me,” he began modestly,
“he is very tall, has beautiful red
hair, slanting green eyes, wears
huge balloon pants, and a class
toque. Perhaps he is more of a
Scandinavian than a Greek type.
In sports his ability is really sec-
ond only to my own.”

John Meyer, who Tuesday was
resting easily in third place in
the Male Beauty contest, has
been forced to withdraw from
the race. Meyer was declared
ineligible by the Undergraduate
council for further competition
yesterday, when it was discover-
ed that there was a five dollar
library fine standing against his
otherwise good name. The coun-
cil, however, resolving to be len-
ient on Meyer, stated that he
will be restored to good fame
once more if he will pay double
the fine, viz. $10.00 to The Daily
Maroon.

Tired of Home?

Try Adventures
In Ancient Cairo

By Mary Winner Hughes

“Yeh, got tired of American cul-
ture, so struck out on my own hook 1
for Egypt and the Holy Land!” Mor-
ris A. Frank, undergraduate of the
University and would-be Marco Polo,
smiled across at us and prepared for
a recitation of his adventures.

“And incidentally, I took in Europe, i
though four of the six months I spent i
in Cairo. There’s a nice suspicious |
city for you! And the customs offi-
cials—Phew! Just listen—as I
started through the gates of the city
with a couple of daggers I had picked
up for souvenirs sticking in my belt,
out popped two of these C. O.’s. They
spotted the lumps under my coat, in-
vestigated, and lighted upon the dag-
gers. Presto! I was a desperate
character! One of them snatched
the daggers, broke the blades in two
and handed the hilts back to me. while
the other mussed up my baggage look-
ing for more weapons,'and both were
for hauling me off to jail, or the
equivalent in Egypt—until I pre-
sented my credentials!”

He chuckled. “But I paid the town
back! A counle of other college boys

Among the new books of poetry
which have been added to the rental
library, “Lava Lane,” by Nathalia
Crane, a twelve year old Brooklyn
girl, has aroused much comment.

Other new books of poetry include,
“I Heard a Sailor” and “Home,” by
Wilfred Gilson, “First Poems,” by
Edwin Muir, “Verse,” by Adelaide
Crepsy, and “Selected Poems,” by
Aldous Huxley.

WASHINGTON PROM
TICKETS READY FOR
FRATERNITY HEADS

Tickets for the 1926 Washington
Prom have been allotted. They are
waiting in the ante room off the ex-
aminer’s office for the secretaries of
the fraternities to come and get them.

The tickets must be taken away by
Friday or forfeited, according to Paul
Cullom, one of the Prom leaders. The
office is open from 1 until 4 every
school day.

Payment must be made by Wed-
nesday, Feb. 3, at which time all
tickets that have not been taken will
be redistributed; fraternities wishing
more tickets on the later allotment
must apply when getting their first
group.

MIRROR PLANS
SECOND TRYOUT

Give Further Opportunity to
Women Seeking Parts

Additional tryouts for the First
.Annual Mirror will be held tomorrow
at 3:30 in the theatre of Ida Noyes
hall. All those women who were un-
able to go through the second trial,
and those who were not able to ap-
pear at all. have been requested to
appear for this try-out, which will be
for both cast and chorus. Miss Mari-
anne Durbrow, who will coach the
choruses, will be in charge of the try-
outs.

Alta Cundy, general manager of
Mirror, wishes to remind all those
women who can play the banjo,
ukelele, saxaphone or any other in-
strument to meet with her Tuesday
from 12 to 12:30 in Cobb 110. Those
interested in singing have been asked
to meet with her in the theatre of Ida
Noyes hall Monday at 3:30 to try
out for vocal parts.

“The response of the women at our
first tryout was extremely encourag-
ing,” said Miss Cundy. “However,
we know that there is a great deal of
hidden talent yet to be revealed, and
we want evetytiody who is interested
to come to the tryout tomorrow. Miss
Durbrow will tell you how good you
are.”

Miss Cundy wishes to emphasize
the fact that both of these meetings
are extremely important, and at- i
tendance at them may influence the
final choices.

EXAMINER’S OFFICE
MAKES PLANS FOR
CHANGE IN SYSTEM

Quicker and more efficient service
for students and all co-operating de-
partments is the promise of the Ex-
aminer’s office. A new filing system
is being installed which will consoli-
date the several old files into one
complete index of all current cases.
“Charge-out” cards will be inserted
whenever a case is removed from the
files so that the location of a stu-
dent’s credentials will no longer be
a matter of question.

“The Window,” 'heretofore synon*
omous with long waiting, will again
be under the complete charge of one
assistant. It is hoped that this will
do away with the series of long ex-
planations necessary before the stu-
dent has been able to find the person
familiar with his case.

A minimum of explanation, a min-
imum of the more or less expected
“ red tape,” a minimum of time Sp^ni
by both the student and the harassed
clerks in the office is the goal of the
office which decides the fate of fell
entering students. ‘The Powers that
be” expect the new system to be
working smoothly by the end o| ^|s
quarter.

Historical facts showing Pontius
Pilate, the Roman procurator who
condemned Jesus, to have been an
arch-villain throughout his political
career, have been uncovered in a
study prepared at the University by
Miss Dorothea M. Harjes. The dis-
closure is made in an introductory
statement to a thesis on “Pontius
Pilate in Germanic Folklore”- tracing
the various German legends referring
to Pilate from the second to the sev-
enteenth centuries.

These legends, Miss Harjes says,
develop the notion of a fitting death
for a man who, in general Christian
thought, is regarded as a scoundrel.

Antagonized Jews

An “inflexible, merciless and ob-
stinate” official, Pilate antagonized
the Jews at every turn and caused to
be murdered several bands of inno-
cent Christians, Miss Harjes goes on
to show. She continues, “He regu-
larly flaunted the eagles of the Ro-
man Legions and the standards of
Tiberius, (both to be worshipped as
dieties by Roman law) before a peo-
ple who believed it sinful to worship
any but their one God.

“He tried to enforce their obedience
to this Roman mandate.

Lured Samaritan*

“It has been stated that the Samar-
itans whom he destroyed on Mt.
Garizim were lured there by a spy
in Pilate’s employ who promised them
the discovery of certain holy vessels
buried there by Moses on the moun-
tain side.	*

“Eusebius tells with a fair degree
of historical accuracy of the events
of Pilate’s procuratorship but adds
(upon what authority we do not
know) that he was banished to Vi-
enne in Gaul and there committed
suicide.”

“Spiced Wine”Is
Latest Play In

Paris Stagedom

“The Latest Thing from Chicago.”
In Paris! That’s the way French
theatres may soon be advertising
their plays; as a result of the influ-
ence of the University Dramatic asso-
ciation, according to Americans in the
French capital who predict an in-
creasing popularity for American1
plays.

For “Spiced Wine,” Willis K. Jones’
new play, which is to be produced for
the first time in the Dramatic asso-
ciation Playfest, Feb. 5 and 6, is to be'
produced in Paris next summer.

The Strolling Players, an American
dramatic organization now playing in
Paris lias erquested permission to in-
troduce iMr. Jones’ play to the French
stage. And arrangements have just (
been completed for the production
early next summer.

Mr. Jones is a graduate student in
the romance language department of
the University.

PLAN INSURANCE
ENDOWMENT AS
SENIOR PRESENT

Discuss Purchase of $250
Insurance Policies in

Chapel Today

Shall the class of ’26 break tradi-
tion by presenting the University
with a gift that wiH in a score of
years amount to $300,000?

Members of the senior class will
discuss this question today when they
consider an insurance endowment
plan suggested to the class gift com-
mittee by Charles F. Axelson, ’07,
of the board of trustees:

The plan involves the purchase of
a $250 insurance endowment policy
by each of the seniors. Twelve dol-
lars a year is paid on the policy for
20 years, at the end of which time
the full amount of the endowment is
turned over to the University.

Committee Favor* Plan

“The Senior class gift committee
is strongly in favor of the project,”
declared Seward Covert, chairman of
the group. “If four or five hundred
seniors purchase the policy, we can
donate a gift of greater quantity and
more useful quality than any other
class has given.

“The policy itself is not large, and
the yearly payment is so small that
it is of scarcely any appreciable im-
portance. But after twenty years we
shall have given to the University a
gift not only of which we may be
proud, but one that will set an ex-
ample for the classes that are to
come.”

Anderton Approve*

Charles Anderson, president of the
Undergraduate council, expressed
himself in favor of the plan. “It’s a
noble project, even if it is a little ex-
pensive. I think it’s worth while if
it succeeds in doing nothing more than
setting a shining example to future
classes.”

Although no vote has yet been
taken on the subject, the class seems
generally divided on the matter. No
better suggestion has yet been pre-
sented, according to Covert, and this
suggestion, besides having the sup-
port of alumni, is practically ideal.

Miller Gives Opinion

“All the buildings have, I believe,
been supplied with clocks and statu-
ary,” said Allan Miller, president of
the class. “The endowment plan is
worth considering for its singularity
at least.”

Discussion is expected to occupy
most of today’s chapel session, so that
the vote will not be taken until next
Thursday’s meeting. “Every senior
is expected to vote on the plan,” con-
cluded Covert, “and the gift commit-
tee urges the class to adopt it.”

MRS. ALTROCCHI TO
ADDRESS IL CIRCULO
ON ITALIAN POETRY

Mrs. Rudolph Altrocchi will speak
on “Italian Sketches In Prose and
Verse” at a meeting of II Circulo
Italiano today at 4:30 in the north
reception room of Ida Noyes hall.

Mrs. Altrocchi’s talk will include
discussions of various published and
unpublished poems in additions to a
sketch of Italian life entitled “Paint-
ed Sea Gulls.” As the address will
be given in English, all persons in-
terested have been invited to attend.

Plans for a trip to the Dante thea-
tre will be discussed.

Extend Privileges

In Ida Noyes Hall

Mrs. George Goodspeed, chairman
of the Ida Noyes advisory council,
has announced that on Friday and
Saturday afternoons and evenings,
women of the University may play
bridge in Ida Noyes hall. She has
announced that at dances given by
various organizations, men may
smoke in the sun-parlor.

CHICAGO’S DEBUT: A TRIBUTE TO H. J. SMITH

TTENRY JUSTIN SMITH in his brief connection with the adminis-

A tration of the University has rendered a valuable service, and
his leaving to accept an editorial position on The Daily News rep-
resents a distinct loss. As director of the department of public rela-
tions Mr. Smith has aided the University in accomplishing what has
almost amounted to a revolution.

The change wrought has not been one of curriculum, or of organ-
ization, but the even more difficult metamorphosis of attitude, both
of the part of the public toward the University, and of the institution
toward itself. The University was not long ago regarded, both from
within and from without, as a sort of intellectual monastery set apart
from the rest of the world. What it sought to do seemed to the aver-
age layman a sort of abstract pursuit of learning for learning's sake,
of no concern in his existence. Perhaps the professor was too much
inclined to say, “They won’t understand, and what we are doing
will be misrepresented anyway.”

Newspaper reporters found very little cooperation from many of
the faculty members, and at times from administrative officials. Per-
haps some experiences had given basis for their aloofness.

However, those charged with the administration came to the con-
clusion that the University had need of interpreting itself, and per-
haps at the same time “finding itself. No alteration of any mag-
nitude in the work it was doing was required. But a change in atti-
tude was necessary.

The public relations department was created and to Mr. Smith
was given the momentous task of seeking to bring about the change
sought. He was an alumnus of the University of Chicago, and a
successful newspaper man, with the experinece and understanding
necessary for his difficult task.

Since July, 1924, the public has been brought to a greater real-
ization of the vital importance to the “man in the street” of the
work of the University, and those who are accomplishing that work
know that they can better serve by seeking to inform the public
of what they are doing. A mutual benefit has been the result. A
more cordial relatoinship has been established between the university
and the press, resulting in a cooperation which greatly augments
the service of the University.

The idea that a university is a place apart from the world where
queer people pursue queer obj< :ts is being broken down. The in-
stitution itself no longer holds aloof. The condition, so often char-
acterized by President Mason since his coming here, as the ideal
position of a university is being attained at Chicago. It remains suf-
ficiently apart from the world that it may have the proper perspec-
tive, and yet not so far away as to make its work impractical.

Old traditions and customs do not break down easily, even with
men of scientific minds. But those men have been reasonable. To
Henry Justin Smith must always belong a great deal of credit for the
“debut” of the University of Chicago. He has introduced his alma
mater to the world society.—A Student and Reporter.

and I took in one of the cabarets,

“You did some sight-seeing per-
haps?” we suggested.

“You bet! Looked over museums,

By

In a fast but rough game last night
the local cagemen went down to a
disappointing defeat at the hands of
the Gopher quintet, 26 to 24. The
Maroons fought hard all the way, but
the dribbling-long pass system of the
Minnesota squad was just a little too
much for the Norgrenite’s defense.

Maroons Make Usual Score

Chicago made its usual quota of
about twenty points, but could not
hold Rasey, a second Spradling, from
coming through with five baskets
all by himself, the other Gopher for-
wards and center were not at all
backward in sinking buckets for that
matter, either.

. Nydahl, left forward for the Min-
nesotans, dropped two field-goals and
three foul throws and Wolden, his
teammate came through with two
field goals to his credit. Tuttle play-
ed guard in place of Wright, who
started but only played a few min-
utes.

Rough Game

Many fouls were made the game
being in this respect much like the

lllini game, in which the
were victors. The Maroons
idle either. Zimmerman led
scoring with four baskets

Maroons
were not
the local
and two

free throws. Sacket, Hoerger, and
McDonough each made one and four
foul throws between them.

Kearns Referees

Kearns, the referee, had a hard
time trying to keep roughness out of
the game, as si attested to by the
many fouls, personal and otherwise,
the Minnesota boys were the ones
mostly called for this, though, and
the Chicagoans left feeling disap-
pointed and weary.

New Fraternity
Sport—Molander

Something new in the line of win-

ter sports has been added to the In-
tramural program. This is the An-
nual Foul Shooting Contest to be in-
troduced on Feb. 10. Both the Bart-
! lett and University High School gyms
f will be put into use as this is sure
to be one of the most popular sports
on the program.

No Limit to Entries

There is no limit to the number of
contestants that may enter from any
one organization. Points are award-
ed on the individual record, and then
the five high men for each organiza-
tion are taken for their organization’s
score. Unattached men are urged to
compete because of the stress put on
the individual scoring by this method.
Each contestant attempts fifty shots
at the basket,- every successful try
counting one point for his record.

Some very good showings are ex-
pected because of the intensive goal-
shooting practice which the intra-
mural cage games have afforded. The
very important part which this factor
। plays in basketball helps to make this
j new sport of foul shooting all the

SHIRTS FOR WORK ON I
FROSH BASKET TEAM

j more interesting.

Boasting an extremely powerful
offense and also possessing several
good guards the 1926 freshman cage
team looms forth as one of the best
developed at the University for years.
The green shirts symbolic of the
frosh basketeers have been allotted
to ten men by Coach Fritz Crisler and
the numeral winners will undoubtedly
be selected from this group.

At present, Cooper of Lindblom and
Kaplan, former Englewood flash,
have the call at forwards. Kaplan,
while short, is an excellent handler
of the ball and his speedy dribbling is
a feature of the team. Cooper has a
powerful build and also a dead eye
for the basket. McGregor, a former
guard, and Goodman, have also shown
up well in the forward role. Round-
ing out the scoring trio is Gist, for-
mer Hyde Park captain and all-city
choice. His floor work and dribbling
are of the best and he is the best shot
on the team under the basket. Kelly,
star fullback, is also playing the pivot
position and is handling the ball in
a sensational fashion.

Four guards are alternating at the
defensive positions. They are Mar-
shall, Williams, McCarthy and Mc-
Queuan. Marshall is going the best
now and in addition to playing a
steady game at guard he is playing
down the floor and getting his share
of baskets.

Women’s Speakers’ club will meet
today at 7 in the theatre of Ida Noyes
hall.

The Physics club will meet at 4:30

Today is the last day for entries
in the gala ice skating carnival for
tomorrow the entry list will be closed.
Everything is in readiness for the
affair which is new in the sporting an-
nals of this school. The University
officials have consented to and even
encouraged the inclusion of events
for women on the meet program and
three races will give them an oppor-
tunity to display their skill.

The South Park commissioners and
the Intia-mural department are work-
ing together on the plans and details
so that everything will be run off
smoothly and without delay. The
commission is getting the Washing-
ton Park rink into condition and the
course selected is sure to be level
and clear. • ,

Non-fraternity men are very
strongly urged to enter as the de-

Purple “Battle Song” Enables
Wildcats to Defeat Hawkeyes

By Victor Roterus

They are humming a new tune on
the Northwestern campus now-a-days.
It’s called their “Battle Song.” And
since Monday night the North Shore
students have as much faith in it -as
they have in their football team’s
harbinger of luck, the Wildcat, which
animal did more for the Purple’s
athletic prestige last fall than did
any team of eleven football men in
former years.

“It’s not a misplaced faith either,”
they declare in Evanston, and just by
the way of proof they point out some
interesting circumstances. It seems
that the school where Tim Lowry is
enrolled had high and dreamy hopes
regarding the prospects of their bas-
ketball team—that is, before the con-
ference season opened. Even in the
proverbial “good old days” N. W.
had not boasted of such a group of
accurate basket-shooters.

As the season opened no one
doubted that the courtmen could
shoot baskets. That was all very good
but the trouble was that somehow or

floor and even without any mud had
all sorts of misgivings before they
could quench “Moon” Baker and his
gang of sharpshooters. The Purple
were in unusually good form that
night, scoring thirty markers, but the
Ann Arborites heaved in enough
throws through the hoop to count up
t othirty and then chucked in one
more to boot. So it was with Purdue,
38-35; and Indiana, 39-31; and Wis-
consin, 35-27.

Something must be done, moaned
Evanston; four games have been
played and not a victory. Along
about this time the winning composi-
tion for a varsity songwriting con-
test was announced. Why not spur
the boys on with this new chant? If
the howls of a wildcat could encour-
age superhuman efforts from the
football men what wouldn’t a song
from the throats of 5,000 do to the
basketball quintet!

So at the Iowa game last Monday
night the whole University lifted its
chin and gave voice to the new re-
frain.

Handsome Cup to Winner

Not only does the high point or-
ganization receive a handsome silver
loving cup; it automatically becomes
the Chicago representative in the Big
Ten Foul Shooting Contest, sponsored
by the intramural department of the
University of Minnesota, which is pre-
senting a large trophy to the winner.

Wrestlers Win From
Hawthorne Athletes

Maroon grapplers won a closely
fought wrestling meet last evening
from the Hawthorne Athletic Club.
The score was 15 to 14.

In the heavyweight match, Krogh,
of Chicago, beat his opponent by a
fall in very short time. In the 117
pound tussle LeVerdi, Chicago, lost
on decision to Kerovitch. This match
was the feature of the evening and
was long drawn out.

The Maroons had little difficulty
in the 135 pound match, winning with
comparative ease. Johnson won his
engagement, in the 177 pound class,
by a fall, in short time. Davis lost
in the 145 and Massey in the 160.

In the preliminaries the Chicago
second squad beat Larribee Y. M.
C. X.

As expected, an unusually large
crowd was out at Bartlett gym to
see the matches. However the famed
orchestra of the Hawthorne aggrega-
tion did not entertain, as had been
previously scheduled.

^^hen it’s the night of
the season’s most festive dance—

O! He twirls his black mustachio,
And winks his wicked eye,
And chews of nuts pistachio,
As dainty maidens sigh.

And the nuts he chews are nourish-

The audience’s ear's caressed

“Woman is a sphinx without a secret”
. ' . . to have a secret there must
be thoughts and a woman is as bar-

only her desire to live with a man,
whom she thus unconsciously recog-

her she adopts artifices which lead

players, as the gas lights over the
Exit Doors vacillate in the darkness
—please, please, don’t laugh if the

This morning he came into the Ma-

a desk. Then, pacing up and down
