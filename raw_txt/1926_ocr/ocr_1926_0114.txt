CAP AND GOWN

Print Eight Pages of Book
on Antique Parchment
Is Plan

Several supplementary sections
will make the 1926 Cap and Gown
one of the best annuals published
inside the quadrangles within the
last few years. Charles Eckstein, edi-
tor of the book, said so as part of a
statement he issued late yesterday
afternoon.

Eight pages of the book will be
printed on antique parchment, an
innovation in college annuals. They
will be illuminated in three colors
by James Root.

Leather Cover

Eckstein also pointed out other
salient features of the new annual.
The cover will be of the latest Ger-
man design, made from one-fourth
inch leather stock, and inscribed with
a large, embossed inscription.

In addition to the eight tri-color
pages, there will be thirty pages
printed by a two color process, and
lavishly decorated end sheets.

Enlarge Section*

One hundred pages of the book
will be devoted to athletics and eight
pages to intimate views of campus
life. The quadrangles will furnish
subjects for thirty sketches through-
out the book, the work to be done
by such artists as James Root, Bill
CoUnt and Rainey Bennett.

Social events of the year will re-
ceive solicitous attention, if the pro-
ductions of the editor’s statement
materialise.

The athletic section will include,
as one of its many features, action
pictures of the individual football
players. One of its new featui es
will be pictures of the Illinois game,
taken from the moving picture film,
that was shown immediately after
the game at the leading moving pic-
ture theatres of the city.

The book will sell for four dollars
and a half until sprfig. when the
price will go up to five dollars.

bookjackets show
VARIETY OF COLORS
STYLES AND DESIGNS

‘J

An exhibit of bookjackets has been
placed in Harper W-31 with a view
to show the predominating styles of
this year. A variety of colors rang-
ing from pale heliotrope to bright
vermilion and grotesqueness of de-
sign in figures seems to be this year s
mode.

"Bookjackets have style, they have
individuality; and as styles in (^ess
change from year to year, so do
bookjackets. The bookjacket has a
very definite mission in life,” said
Miss Little, University librarian, “If
a bookjacket fulfills its duty it must
make an appeal to the public, such
an appeal that the public will buy.”

The books of Ben Hecht are
equipped with bizarre jackets which
portray their ribald, bohemianistic
content, while the adventure of Wil-
liam Shaynor Lyons is hinted at by
the dashing, romantic portraits which
adorn the jackets of his books.

“It is the jacket that first attracts
the eye of the casual book buyers.
It is a matter of psychology. There-
fore publishers are bending their ef-
forts to put impressionistic jackets in
gay colors on the volumes they hope
to become ‘best sellers.

Prof. Merriam Talks
on Italian Nationalism

“Some Aspects of Italian National-
ism” will be the subject of a lecture
by Prof. Charles Merriam, chairman
of the Political Science department,
at a meeting of the II Circalo Italiano
today at 4:30 in Ida Noyes hall. After
the speech there will be a business
meeting at which a new president wi 1
be elected.

to Honor Work
- of McLaughlin

In recognition of the twenty years
of service which Prof. Andrew C.
McLaughlin has completed as head of
the department of history at the Uni-
versity, colleagues and students are
unveiling a portrait of him at the
Quadrangle club on Saturday, Jan. 16,
at 4:30. The portrait will be on ex-
hibition at the club for a few weeks.

The portrait of Prof. McLaughlin
was painted by Mr. Malcolm Parcell,
a young American artist who was
commissioned to paint one of former
President Burton.

Friends started a campaign in June
of last year to secure the necessary
funds under the leadership of a com-
mittee headed by Miss Cora iM. Get-
tys, Harper reference librarian. Stu-
dents of the professor immediately
subscribed to one quarter of the quota
and the remainder was raised from
among his friends and fellow his-
torians. During the following aut-
umn the portrait was started and it
was completed previous to the time
contemplated, June, 1926, when Prof.
McLaughlin will celebrate his twen-
tieth anniversary as chief executive
of the history department.

W. A. A. SPONSORS
SING-A-M A-J1G TODAY

IN IDA NOYES HALL

Women of the University will
gather today at 3:30 in the main
gymnasium of Ida Noyes hall to take
part in the W. A. A. “Sing-a-ma-jig.”
Mrs. Charles Robbins, who conducted
several classes in singing last quar-
ter will lead the singing.

Mrs. Robbins will be accompanied
at the piano by her daughter, Helen,
who was graduated from the Univer-
sity two years ago. Miss Robbins
was prominent in activities on cam-
pus and was also secreary of W. A. A.
Mimeograph copies of the songs which
will be sung will be distributed among
the women. According to Eleanor
Fish, president of W. A. A., under
whose auspices the affair will be con-
ducted, all women have been urged
to come and learn some new clever
and catchy college songs.

“This is one of the first attempts
of the University to encourage sing-
ing among the campus women,” said
Eleanor Fish last night. “It is not
only an original but a very clever
plan.”

ASPIRANTS IN

FIRSTTRYOUT

Candidates Reduced To
Twenty in Close
Competition

Candidates for parts in the dra-
matic association’s annual Settlement
benefit production, The Playfest,
have been reduced by tryouts-rehear-
sals from 75 to 20. according to
Eleanor Metzel and Archie Trebow
of the board of selection.

Competition, members of the board
say, has been exceptionally close, and
much new dramatic talent has been
discovered. A number of those who
have taken part in past performances
have also survived the eliminations.

Give Three Play*

There will be three ‘one-act plays,
all written by campus playwrights.
Nine parts are open in the casts.
The selections will continue in Rey-
nolds theatre each afternoon until
the casts are definitely chosen.

Members of the board express
themselves as highly pleased with
the tryouts, which they declare, are
proving unusually successful.

Settlement To Get Proceeds

The Playfest will be presented
Feb. 5 in Mandel hall. The proceeds
will be given to the University Set-
tlement fund, according to an an-
nouncement made by Archie Trebow,
production manager.

Science Explains
Why Men Have

Always Waited

“Time and tide wait for no man”
says the old saw, hut many men have
waited long and often for women,
about whom the adage says naught.
Inquisitive professors and students at
Johns Hopkins university have con-
ducted a series of experiments at vari-
out eastern colleges in an effort to
solve this problem.

The reason for the habitual tardi-
ness, according to Dr. G. D. Stewart,
of Johns Hopkins university, who fos-
tered the experiments, is purely psy-
chological. The tests were the same
for both men and women. Each sub-
ject was given a particular duty to
fulfill. Some read from a book; others
accomplished small tasks. At the end
of a specific length of time the ex-
aminer questioned the students as to
the number of minutes it had taken
each to finish his work. The majority
of the women judged incorrectly. The
men, on the whole, judged the time
correctly and those who gave errone-
ous answers were not as far distant
from the correct answer as were the
women.

Dr. Stewart claims that women do
not know how to judge time when
they dress, and therefore are very
seldom punctual, although they are
not naturally slower than men.

PREXY HAS DAY FOR

“DEBT LIQUIDATION”

“Debt liquidation day” was called
at Capital University recently by
President Otto Mees, head of the in-
stitution. Interested in the most
deeply rooted college tradition of
which America can boast—that of
borrowing, Dr. Mees has determined
to remedy the “collegiate malady.”

“Whether soap, shirt, studs, or
dress suit, it is an old tale—forgotten
responsibilities,” explained Dr. Mees.
“And the acme of forgetfulness is
attained in the realm of the collegia'll
financial operations. He borrows and
forgets. Liquidation day is the set-
tlement.”

College Students as Impractical
Because of World Court Stand

WILKINS STARTS ON
ROAD TO RECOVERY

Charging that college students are
too impractical and idealistic to take
a definite hand on such a momentous
question as the entrance of the United
States into the World court, the Fian-
cial and Commercial Chronicle, in an
editorial entitled “Propaganda on the
World Court,” opposes such methods
of influencing public opinion as straw
votes and intercollegiate conference.

“We question the advisability of
schools',colleges and universities hold-
ing referendums on the question of
entering the World Court and the cov-
ert attempt thus to utter speech for
the people. Youth is idealistic. It
holds more to the abstract than to the
concrete. In this sense it is imprac-
tical. Given a glittering proposal for
furthering the world peace and its
enthusiasm takes fire. Led by the
theories of academic origin it comes
to believe itself to be a factor in
world progress. It is prone to mis-
take this for wisdom. An urge to do
something for human betterment
seems an imperative duty. While out-
side the shadowy cloisters of study
there beats upon the real control in a
democracy the fierce light of struggle
and controversy. To youth, adventur-
ing far in the world, a world of the
student’s dream, may seem wiser that
so-called national isolation. To the
voter, who thinks and toils, seasoned
in the strife of politics and encom-
passed by the domestic problems of
economics and industry, caution even
to the point of hesitation and delay,
may seem to be the road to safety
and security.

“We do not charge secret design in
the** college efforts. We contemplate
onlv the fact. There is danger that
they be given undue weight by the
casual thinker. While school and
church are separate under govern-
ment, they are neither of them in
Government.

SETTLEMENT NIGHT
HEADS CELEBRATE

SUCCESS OF DRIVE

Committee chairmen and members
of the winning teams in the last Set-
tlement drive will attend the annual
Settlement drive theatre party, Tues-
day, Jan. 26. Seward Covert, co-
chairman of the campaign, announced
the plans and date for the affair to-
day.

Besides Covert and Carolyn Pratt,
executives of the drive, heads of all
committees whose combined work
made the drive a record success, will
be present. Parker Hall and Ellen
McCracken, co-chairmen of finance;
Alta Cundy and Don McGinnis, co-
chairmen of vaudeville; Catherine
Campbell and Robert Carr, co-chair-
men of decorations; George Bates and
Elizabeth Stewart, co-chairmen in
charge of music; William Heitman
and Milton Kreines, program man-
agers; Paul Cullom and Lucy.Lamon,
managers of booths; Frances Kendall
and Graham Stewart, in charge of
donations, and George Wiemer, direc-
tor of tag day; these executives have
received invitations.

Mary Harvey, who captainad the
winning women’s team, will bring her
assistants, while Holmes Boynton and
his team will be present.

“Although the place of the party
has not yet been determined,” said
Covert, “we shall see either ‘Pigs’ or
‘Blossom Time.’ ”

Whether Dean Ernest Hatch
Wilkins will resume his capacity of
Dean of the Colleges is problemat-
ical, and depends entirely on the
results of his stay at the Presby-
terian hospital.

This is the crux of a statement
made early today by Dr. Herman
L. Kretschmer, his physician. “Mr.
Wilkins has made definite progress
in the last few days,” declared Dr.
Kretschmer.

“He is much better now than
when he was first brought to the
hospital. Considering his nervous
condition, he has done very well.
We cannot say, however, when he
will be able to leave the hospital,
and when he may resume part or
all of his University duties.”

Both Dr. Kretschmer and Mr.
Wilkins’ nurse stated that he has
not. at any time been in a serious
condition.

PUBLISH ATLAS

0/ MILKY WAY

Prof. Frost Includes Many
Photographs

An atlas of the milky way made
possible by a grant from the Carnegie
institution of Washington is to be
published early this year under the
direction of Prof. Edwin B. Frost,
head of the Yerkes observatory of the
University, it is announced in the ob-
servatory’s bulletin for 1926. The
publication will contain selected prints
from more than 3,500 photographs
of the milky way made by the late
Prof. E. E. Barnard of the Yerkes
staff.

“The collection will be the most
complete of any that has been pub-
lished previously,” a statement of
Prof. Frost declared. “We are grate-
ful to the Carnegie institute for its
assistance.”

NECESSARY FOR
PERFECT CHILD

Sleep, Diet, and Exercise
Named in Health

Formula

Adequate sleep, a simple, whole-
some diet, and out-of-door exercises
constitute the formula for making the
“perfect child,” it is revealed in the
plans set forth by Miss Lydia Roberts,
assistant professor of home economics
at the University, for development of
the University’s co-operative nursery
during 1926. It is thought that the
work of the nursery, in which child-
ren of the University community are
cared for scientifically, will help to
tide them over the so-called "danger-
ous age” from two to five.

Come In Morning

Children are brought to the nursery
in the morning, and when they are
taken home at night they have gone
through a carefully supervised day
during which they have had a bal-
anced lunch, adequate hours for sleep
in the afternoon and time for play
A new ultra-violet ray lamp will be
used in the nursery to give the child-
ren the benefit of sun’s rays that are
absent during winter months, Miss
Roberts says.

The nursery has a three-fold pur-
pose, according to Miss Roberts. It
houses children who otherwise might
not have the benefits of scientific care.
It serves as an educational institution
for mothers who attend fortnightly
lectures and who learn how to care
for their children by approved meth^
ods. It is a laboratory for graduate
students in the Univeristy department
of home economics who contemplate
a home or who are planning to enter
the field of child welfare in univer-
sities or social service.

Make Examination*

It is possible to teach children how
to sleep well and eat properly, Miss
Roberts points out. An efficient staff
studies problems of this sort and then
turns the results of its investigation
on the children. Appetites are ad-
justed as are disorders of the young
nervous systems. Nursery equipment
as well as human ingenuity has been
adapted to the solution of child prob-
lems. With this emphasis, Miss Rob-
erts thinks, the production of not only
healthy citizens but the perfect child-
ren will lie a probability of the not
far distant future.

The nursery takes care of about
forty children daily whose ages range
from two to six.

Mason Is Guest at
Hitchcock Tonight

Residents of Hitchcock hall will en-
tertain Pres. Max Mason tonight from
7 to 8, at the first smoker of the
Winter quarter.

President Mason will give a short
talk based on his brief connection with
the University and long experience
with students. The comnMtfee in
charge promises entertainment.

Compulsory attendance at chapel
was overwhelmingly opposed by the
students at Yale College when they
expressed their disapproval of the
institution by a vote of 1681 against
and 241 for. By a three-to-one ma-
jority the faculty also expressed its
disapproval of the continuance of
compulsory chapel.

The vote was a representative one.
Nearly two thousand out of 23000
eligible undergraduate voters express-
ed their opinions.

A petition is now being circulated
by the Yale News, reading as follows:

“We, the undersigned undergrad-
uates of-Yale College and the Com-
mon Freshman Year, do hereby pe-
tition the faculty of Yale College and
the faculty of the Common Freshman
Year that the element of compulsory
attendance be removed from Yale’s
religious services. We have reached
this decision after a week devoted to
open discussion and a two day refer-
endum which gave evidence that the
undergraduates are of this opinion
to the extent of 1681 for and 241
against. It is our earnest wish that
the faculty of Yale College and the
faculty of the Common Freshman ।
Year pursue the policy for which a 1
desire is herein so clearly expressed.”,

On the first day of its circulation,
the Yale undergraduate petition re-
questing the elimination of the com-
pulsory feature of , chapel exercises
gathered 1312 signatures.

SEEK VOLUNTEERS
FOR SOCIAL WORK
IN Y. M. CAMPAIGN

University men who can devote one
evening each week to the supervising
and training of boys at the University
Settlement house will be placed ae
cording to their abilities by the

need of competent men to direct them.

The Y. M. C. A., through its social
service committee, sends out a call
each year for volunteer workers who
would be willing to perform such ser-
vices. Men, who would like to do this
type of work, will be assigned to
groups at once if they will hand in
their names at the Y. M. C. A. offic?.
After a year of this work they will

PLACES TO STUDY

'T'^ere are reading rooms and reading rooms and reading rooms.

But does the Universtiy boast of a library reading room which
fulfils the requirements of a real place in which to pursue the art of
learning.

Yes, the University provides a library in almost everyone of the
buildings on campus. There is Harper Memorial library, the main
library of the campus. It is large; it provides ample room for many
students to study in. But it is too noisy. The constant coming and go-
ings, the conversations, and what not, are not conducive to concen-
trated study. Classics library is quiet; it is rarely crowded beyond ca-
pacity. But the type of books and the number of books in Classics
library is limited, and E-1 1 is far from Classics.

Some place some especial place which will provide the accout-
rements and the quiet needed for study, is obviously necessary.

nphe Maroon notes with a good deal of satisfaction the newly-an-
■*■ nounced policy of the Cap and Gown not to use more than one
page for any fraternity. The space thus saved can be put to so many
other advantageous uses that it is hardly necessary to list them, ap-
parent as they must be to all. And after all, the old system of
spreading over two pages a lot of information of no particular inter-
estto the world at large was not a very good one. No one cares
much if Omicron Omicron Omicron was founded in 2 1 B. C. or not;
they generally wish it hadn't been.

In the interest of the fratenities so deprived of necessary publici-
ty we might suggest that some of the space saved be devoted to In-
tramural Athletics if instead of rather dry figures, the Cap and Gown
could give some pictures of winning teams, and devote some space
to live write-ups of some of the games and in general brighten up the
section devoted to Intramurals, it would serve two purposes, namely,
that of promoting interest in Intramural games, and of giving the frat-
ernities space accordnig to their merits.

“COLLEGIATE”

By Art Gudget

«/^OLLEGLATL’’ synonymous with “absurdity,” ‘‘imbecility,"
or “idiocy" is the popular expression which is used to epict
and justify the actions of our present day younger generation. It is
a term which, in addition to denoting, excuses all vagaries in con-
duct and in dress. It explains vulgarity, raucousness, and noise; it
warrants looseness, licentiousness, and loudmouthedness. A per-
son who is collegiate is one who sacrifices his individuality to the
half-cocked and half-baked ideas of a smart aleck coterie who have
not been spanked sufficiently in their impressionable years. The
collegiate one must be able to hold a sufficient amount of gin to
become amiably, cleverly, and popularly drunk. He must be well
versed ir 'he proper technicalities of how to treat a decent girl
with the proper lack of respect. His father is “the old man," and
all of his relatives are fools and dull yokels.

Acting “collegiate" is a legal form of disorderly conduct. The
simple rules of courtesy, gentility, and gentlemanliness, are, of
course, considered stiff and old fashioned. The collegiate one must
always be at ease; this also includes remaining in their seats when
ladies enter the room.

Being "collegiate." to sum up the definition^ is a state of mental
deterioration which encourages the adoption of any exaggerated style
in clothes, outlandish form of dancing, hard leather heels, and sus-
penders.

PRESENT LOVING

CUP TO BIG TEN

CHAMPS OF YEAR

Ohio State I-M Department
Makes Offer of

Prize

Green athletes will turn their atten-
tion to still another sport next week
when the intra-mural bowling matches
will start. This was one of the most
popular of all activities last winter
and practically every fraternity as
well as some independent organiza-
tions are entering teams.

All the matches will be held in the
Reynolds student club house where
special hours will be reserved for the
intra-mural games. Already a great
number of fraternity men have been
out cracking the maples and several
high scores have been annexed.

Many Award*

As in the other intra-mural sports
a great number of awards will be giv-
en the various winners. To the Uni-
versity champion will go a special
bowling trophy while beautiful silver
loving cups will be given to second
and third place winners. Gold, silver
and bronze medalettes will be given
to the members of the first three in
the circuit.

A gold medal will be given to the
individual having the highest average
during tho tourney thus giving an
individual as well as a team aspect
to the matches and assuring a man
a chance for a trophy whether he be
on a winning team or not.

To Crown Big Ten Champ*

The intra-mural department of
Ohio State University has announced
that it will give a silver loving cup to
the fraternity champion of the west-
ern conference. This is an excellent
chance for a team to pop a nice trophy
although there will be some tough five
from the other schools in the big ten.

Under the new rules formulated by
the department, five men will consti-
tute a team and three games will be
bowled at each match. The total num-
ber of pins will be the scoring basis
and the team winning two out of
three games will win the match. Play
will begin Thursday, Jan. 21 and all
matches will be under the supervision
of intra-mural officials.

Basketmen Continue

Strenuous Practice

Practice and more practice is the
dailv menu that is being dished out
to the Maroon cage team as thev toil
in their efforts to perfect an offense
to beat the highly rated Wisconsin
quintet. Nergren is concentrating on
the shooting of the forwards for it
takes baskets to win games no mat-
ter how good defensively a team is.

Probably the same lineup that took
the floor against Iowa will face the
Meanwell basketeers for these* men
are receiving the major attention in
practice. “Zimmie” and Sackett who
performed creditably against the
Hawkeyes are slated for the forwards,
with Capt. Alyea at the tip off posi-
tion.

Chuck Hoerger and John McDon-
ough will start at guards with Wallie
Marks ready to fill in should one of
* them be removed for fouls. Norgrei
places his hopes in these men although
three of them are sophomores and are
as yet inexperienced in regard to con-
ference competition.

Plea For Gymnasts, Who Win
Championships But No Glory

By Victor Roteru*

“The University gym team will
strive to uphold its prestige of a de-
cade when they will meet ----.” For

years this simple but weighty sen-
tence has graced the fair columns of
this sport sheet, and also, we gravely
fear, it and subsequent ones have
been wretchedly neglected by our usu-
ally generous and broadminded read-
ing public. Or what reason is there
that accounts for the scanty and
meager gathering at present when

WHATo/ IT?

^tOt^t MOI\GEN5TEaN

The university has all too few tra-
ditions, and now Mr. Tom Eck has
gone and broken up one of the oldest
and, if I do say it, most noble of them
all. Mr. Eck has long been connected
with Maroon sports and with sports
of all kinds. In his day he was cham-
pion of Canada in the standing jump
with dumbells, and he was also an
expert bicycle racer and pocket bil-
liard player back in the days before
the Gay Nineties. With such a back-
ground as this, it was no wonder that
Mr. Eck was selected, some time in
the dim, dark days beyond recall, to
help condition and coach Chicago
teams.

One of the most useful features in
the system of track practice in Bart-
lett Gym has always been the daily
practice chart, on which your candi-
date for the track team, freshman or
varsity, each day inscribed the amount
and condition of his jogging on thac
particular occasion. The form — a
very simple one — was as follows:

Monday Calvin Coolidge jog

Tuesday ” ” jog

And so on. This chart was conve-
niently hung on the wall of the base-
ment training room, and there it was
accessible to all and sundry.

It was a remarkable phenomenom
of the good old times how much run-
ning was done by aspiring track
candidates who were never seen in a
suit, let alone on the track. Each day
there was a modest “jog,” or “2 fast
laps,” or “25 laps” written on the
daily form chart after their names,
although Mr. Eck, looking long and
hard, was never able to spy them out
in the mob who had cluttered up his
track that afternoon. The dodge, I
have heard, was an especially com-
mon one in use among those fresh-
men and sophomores who did not de-
sire to spend their time in physical
culture classes, as it prescribed in the
by-laws of the university. So, by go-
ing out for track, they were excused
from attendance at such classes, and
by writing a daily “jog” down on the
chart they were freed from any sort
of exercise at all. Truly, it was a
noble business.

But Mr. Tom Eck was not to be
fooled by any such paltry trick. After
mature consideration, extending over
a period of some twenty years, he ar-
rived at the conclusion that anyone
who did not visibly run around the
track under his own eyes could not
possibly have run at all upon that
particular day. And so, following
out this process of logic, he arrived
at the further conclusion that anyone
who had written “jog” on the chart
without having possibly been able to
run on that particular day was no

(Continued on page 4)

Coach Hoffer’s energetic members
faithfully tumble and float through
their maneuvers in another valiant
effort to uphold this age-old reputa-
tion.

Risk Neck* But No Glory

Here are these lads, risking their
necks nightly in fatiguing practice
sessions, so that the colors of their
school will float high in gymnastic
circles and earnestly hoping that
someone besides their thoughtful
parentage will witness the humble
spectacle offered by them when they
meet with a team from another in-
stitution. And who invariably at-
tends? No one but Pa, Ma, possibly
Sis, and some of the coach’s dearest
friends.

Campus Ha* Duty

Here is a most singular situation.
The fotball team, which beat Purdue
this fall, was greeted by a thunderous
ovation from the lusty throats of
thousands whenever it rushed out on
Stagg field. Whenever the basketball
quintet, which beat Michigan last
year, files out they are hailed by a
packed house. But when an athletic
group which has been winning cham-
pionships since Tom Eck wore short
trousers prances out they are greeted
by ominous silence.

They meet the Milwaukee Y. M.
C. A. Saturday night in Bartlett at
8 o’clock. The campus has a debt to
pay.

MULTIPLE USE OF

WHISTLE NECESSARY
IN TANK POLO

Coach MacGillivray maintains that
it is absolutely necessary to use the
foui whistle often in order to insure
clean sportsmanship in the new game
of water polo. Last year the Water
Basketball pastime afforded great op-
portunities for the men training for
the wrestling team, and soon the
sport degenerated into' one of the
roughest as well as most unsports-
manlike of team competition. Toward
the end of last year’s season the game
was no more than an excuse to satisfy
past grudges under the rather secure
cover of the splashing waters.

The big ten coaches have stressed
the point of clean play in the new
sport, and so the noise caused by the
referee’s blown objections are no more
obnoxious to the onlookers than care-
less refereeing is to the players.

The Maroon representatives of this
water sport under the leadership of
Captain P. Petrolewitz have through
constant hard work developed into a
squad of eminent strength.

Hall, the blond haired giant goal
keeper, is classed as one of the most
able defenders in the conference. The
goal tender’s playing is most import-
ant as well as a responsible part in
the game. A strong team with a
weak goal tender is lost before start-
ing. Having a reliable man at the
net posts and a strong offense of the
local caliber is quite an accomplish-
ment considering that this is the first
season the game has been played.

the Maroon sprint candidates some
valuable pointers on starting and

ing Murchison is training at
Bartlett Gym for a strenuous in- I
door season starting with meets in |
New York in the near future.

The famous dash man who is an
authority on the fine points of
splinting gave the few onlookers a
real thrill when he reeled off a fast
fifty yards. Lonnie Stagg declared
that Murchison would offer a few
more helpful hints to the sprinters
on the days that he worked out at
Bartlett. Other I. A. C. stars in-
cluding Harold Osborn are expect-
ed to take advantage of the track
in Bartlett Gym.

RECEIVE ENTRIES

FOR TRACK MEET

Entries have been coming in daily
for the Seventh Annual Cook County
Track Meet for city and suburban
high schools. It is sponsored by the
University, which is to be run off in
three meets, the first of which beings
at 9:30 o’clock next Saturday morn-
ing. Over thirty of the leading high
schools in the city and suburban lea-
gues were invited to compete, and as
this meet is regarded as an outstand-
ing indoor track event in prep circles
it is anticipated that nearly all will
enter teams.

Many teams have been pointing to-
wards this meet, by much preparation
since the beginning of the school year.
Little can be foretold as to the rela-
tive strength of the various teams as
many of last year’s star performers
have graduated. Senn High, who
nosed out Oak Park for the cham-
pionship last year is reported to have
another strong aggregation.

Over a hundred men are said to be
undergoing strenuous workouts for
Butch Scanlon’s Hyde Park outfit. If
familiarity with the Bartlett track
means anything, University High
should find the daily practice held
there of some value.

In order to secure every facility
to assure the success of the event,
the South Park’s Commission has
been invited to cooperate with the
Intramural department in staging the
big affair. In accepting this invita-

TO ERECT NEW
RAWSON LABS

TO TERRIBLE TURK

As I look back I see his face,
His eyes so clear and bright.
His nose like that of Grecian God,
His teeth all pearly white—
His golden curls run through the sun
In visions of delight.

But he is gone, I know not where.

’Tis said he has a cold,
And so today I’m left his job.
My plan I’ll now unfold—
I’ll print all contribs he’s refused
And risk his anger bold!

FOR UNIVERSITY

Medicine and Surgery Labs
To Join Imposing Groups
Now Being Erected

YES, Terrible Turk is sick and we
are taking his place today. Whether
this, our first trip on the stormy sea
of column editing, will be success-
ful depends on how you accept what
is herein printed. But remember—
during the last five months we have
formed a friendship with the Turk
that causes us to break with compas-
sion at his sorry plight. Yea! Who
knows but that we are distracted to
even Whistle humor?

Buildings in the new University
Medical group between Ellis and In-
gelside Avenues are stseadily rising.
Plans for the erection of the Rawson
Laboratory of Medicine and Surgery
were recently made, the description
of which follows:

The new Rawson laboratories are
five stories in height, with a supple-
mentary sixth floor on top. The steel
framework is so constructed that at
any time two addition floors may be
added without any alterations in the
present building. It is joined on one
side with the Senn Memorial, and
on another with the Presbyterian
hospital.

Although the floor levels of the

I are the Norman Bridge pathological
laboratories, made possible through
a gift of $100,000 by Mrs. Norman
Bridge. In addition to large labor-
atories with room for thirty-six stu-
dents, there are two private research
laboratories, a technicians’ room,
and a large museum for pathological
specimens.

All of the laboratories throughout
the building have the latest labora-
tory devices, including electrically
operated and accurately controlled
incubator hoods, and steam sterilizer
ovens.

The building has metal door jams
and flush doors throughout, making
it as nearly fireproof as possible. In
addition, a minimum of wood has
been used in the trimmings, both as
a precaution against possible fire,
and in order to make it easier to
preserve the strict cleanliness re-
quired in a medical laboratory.

DAVE KAATZ came into the Ma-
roon office today with a particular
grievance against the enlarged book
chute at E-ll. He says that in re-
turning his books he has twice just
escaped falling in after them, and
strongly recommends that bars be
placed in front of the opening to
prevent any such accidents fro^n tak-

Knowing Dave as we do, we would
----very much like to present two further
recommendations. First, that the

second, that the bars be only erected

the

IMPRESSION
The air was deathly silent and
The house was ghostly black.
And not a man was to be seen
Inside the Psi U shack.
Then, from up above the stairs
A ringing cry transcended—
“Here’s one on me!” the fresh
moaned.

The paddle has descended!

man

two special elevators which open on
one side into the hospital and on
the other side into the laboratories.
Upwards of $28,000 was spent in
equipping the two elevators with all
latest devices including a micro-level-
ing mechanism, which brings the ele-
vator to a stop at the exact level of
the floor, regardless of whether the
operator has been careful in opera-
tion of the car or not. Thus patients
being moved in or out of the car
will experience no jar.

The first floor is devoted to ad-
ministrative offices and to the library,
built to hold more than 25,000 vol-
umes. Each of the second, third and
fourth floors has class rooms, cen-
tral reception rooms and separate
examining rooms for men and wom-
en. The second floor will be devoted
to the study of pediatrics, children’s
diseases, dermatology, gynecology
and obstetrics. In addition, the best
of X-ray apparatus will be located
on this floor.

The third floor is devoted exclu-
sively to the study of medicine with
the exception of two laboratories for
eye study. These eye rooms are to-
tally without natural light and are
painted black to enable the students
and physicians working there to have
available direct artificial light with-
out reflection from the walls. These
rooms and the X-ray laboratories
are practically the only ones in the
building which are not completely
lit with natural light.

The study of surgery occupies the
entire fourth floor, while on the fifth

adjacent Senn memorial building will
house the Central free dispensary,
which organization, during the past
year gave treatment to more than
100,000. Special arrangments have
been made for the care of these pa-
tients. In many cases mothers seek-
ing treatment bring their children
with them to the dispensary, and for
these a children’s play room with
a play director in charge is being
established. There are two operating
rooms on the fourth floor where
minor operations will be performed,
and throughout the building are
small treatment rooms.

Medical research will be stressed
in the new building and a number

of private research laboratories have
been provided for the more advanced
students conducting independent

in-

vestigations

Dear Sir:

I noticed the Maroon headline yes-
terday, “Women Speakers Hold
Track Meet.” Will you please let me
‘ know the requirements on which the
judges will base their decisions. I
am sure that I can move my tongue
faster than any girl in school, and
should very much like to enter the
meet.

Athletically,

TERRIBLE TURK! We hope you
get well soon. We now realize all
the agonies you must go through be-
fore your column is printed every
day. We praise your splendid per-
severance in the face of the stuff
that is thrown at you as contribu-
tions. And may the Chief of Po-
lice, himself, help you if you ever
get sick again and make us write

this column!

“The Intramural department has
flooded the tennis courts behind Man-
del hall in order to provide the stu-
dents with an exclusive rink in which
to practice for the carnival and pros-
pective. contestants may use it at any
time,’’ said Doctor Molander, who is
particularly enthusiastic about the
carnival, and feels sure that it will
become an annual and important
event on the University sports ros-
ter.

Whereupon, he proceeded to take -
steps against any continuation of ’A’*
abuse. He posted Mr. Elmer Lampe,
himself something of an athlete, to
watch over the daily dope charts, and
to guard against such trickery as had
gone on before. Candidates for the
track teams, therefore, were obliged
to actually get into a suit and do
some running before their “jog”
would be accepted under the new ar-
rangement. So, you see, Mr. Eck has
effectively cured an open sore on the
department of physical education.
Gosh, how sore my legs are for the
last couple of days!

your own
dauntless champion sud-

denly soars ahead and
wins—have a Camel!

For you’ll never find
another friend so attuned
to your triumphs as
Camel. Camels are made
of the choicest tobaccos
grown — they never dis-
appoint your taste.
Camels annihilated ciga-
retty after-taste. Regard-
less of price, you’ll never
buy better tobaccos, or
blending, or flavor than
you get in Camels.

So this year when the
old school’s men go
through for victory after
victory — taste then the
smoke that’s choice of the
world’s victorious.

Have a Camel!

Into the making of this one cigarette goes all of the ability
of the world’s largest organization of expert tobacco men.
Nothing is too good for Camels. The choicest Turkish and
domestic tobaccos. The most skilful blending. The most
scientific package. No other cigarette made is like Camels.
No better cigarette can be made. Camels are the over-
whelming choice of experienced smokers.
