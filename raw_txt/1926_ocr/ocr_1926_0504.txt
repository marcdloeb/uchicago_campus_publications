Joins McGinnis as Second
Superior Selected from
Cast

Seward Covert, leading man in the
new Blackfriar production, “Wallie
Watch-Out,” has just been elected a
Superior of the order. Blackfriar offi-
cials announced yesterday.

’Covert, who will play the part
Jefferson, enjoyed the distinction
having been a member of the cast

of
Qf
of

four consecutive Blackfriar shows.
Throughout his scholastic career, he
has been active in dramatics.

Selected From Cast

“The honor,” says Paul Cullom,
Abbot of Blackfriars, “comes as a fit-
ting reward to Covert’s achievements.
Covert's election shows that adminis-
trative positions in Blackfriars may be
won by work in the cast, as in the
case of Don McGinnis.”

Jim Parker, heavyweight over at
the Sig Alph house, won this year’s
”How I Earned My Way Through
College” award when he salted
away $20 in thirty-three minutes
and fifteen seconds last Saturday
afternoon.

It seems that four of his frater-
nity brothers bet him $5 apiece that
he couldn’t run five miles in forty
minutes. So Jim got hot under the
collar and said, as did D’Artagnan
of old, “Come out behind Bartlett
gym tomorrow night at sunset and
I’ll have it out with you.”

At 5 o’clock Jim and his seconds
appeared on the cinder track. At
5:15 he began the gruelling test.
The minutes passed. Through the
twilight the figure of Jim was seen
steaming on. Then came the last
lap with ten minutes to go. He
faltered. Thump—thump—nearer
and nearer—then, the tape snapped.
Twenty crisp bank notes flew
gently out into the night.

LOST STUDENT
STILL MISSING

University Aids in Search
For Miss Lawrenz

Freshmen of the Law school will be
the hosts of the campus at a mixer
to be held on next Friday, May 7, from
4 to 6 in Ida Noyes theatre. The
music will be furnished by Bill Hahn’s
College Crew, reinforced by some new
members, according to Herbert C. De
Young, president of the class. Spe-
cialty stunts that have been planned
will be announced later.

It is the efforts of these students to
make this the biggest and best mixer
of the year, according to George Hoff-
man, co-manager of the affair. He is
working in conjunction with Inus
Catron to make all preparations. Other
freshman law students who are help-
ing them are: Helen Cuppaidge, Roger
Leech, Harry May, Tom Mulroy, Vic-
tor Wisner, Walter Schafer, Larry
Newmark, Harry Greenburg, Malcolm
Barton, and John Day.

Although this is the first attempt of
the Law school to break into society,
they have been considering for some
years a social gathering of 'some sort.
Herb DeYoung feels that the law stu-
dents do not come into contact with
the rest of the campus as much as
they should or would like to. It is
for this reason that they have been
anxious for a get together and decided
upon a mixer to accomplish this pur-
pose.

Ticket Sale Begins

and

Tickets for the show went on

sale

yesterday, and according to Charles
Cowan, seats are going rapidly. Clubs
and fraternities bought large blocks
of seats when the drawings were held.
Many campus organizatiqns, it is un-
derstood, are planning social affairs
after the play.

Blackfriars who took part in the pro-
ductions of past years are said to be
unanimous in .their praise of “Wallie

of the most strikingly original plays
in the history of the order. Hamilton
Coleman, the director, is especially
well pleased with the work of the
choruses.

scholastic record during her two quar-
ters in residence, but was not widely
known. The University has taken offi-
cial action in joining the search, but
is handicapped by the fact that almost
no one knew the missing girl inti-
mately. Her father, Herman Law-
renz, a retired planter of Elberta, ar-
rived in the city today and conferred
with Mrs. K. K. Link, of the Board
of Deans, who is representing the ad-
ministration.

Police have searched in vain since
the girl’s disappearance was noted last
Wednesday morning. Not a clue has
been found among her personal effects,
which lay in their usual order. Miss
Lawrenz was generally very reticent
and never attempted any extra-curricu-
lar work. During the Winter she had
a slight touch of influenza, but author-
ities doubt any consequent case of
melancholia.

It is believed that the girl met with
an accident and was taken, unconscious
or delirious to hospital, where she
could not be identified. The proba-
bility is that she has remained in a
senseless condition, and the combing
of the city by police has failed to
strike the missing girl.

The University has extended every

facts of the case. It was revealed that

Noyes hall. All members of the or-
ganization will be eligible to vote.

Eunice Hill and Betty Graham are
the candidates for the office of presi-
dent; Ruth Burtis and Victoria Smith
for general manager; Dorothy Low
and Catherine Rose for secretary; Ruth
Daniel and Miriam Walker for busi-
ness manager.

All candidates have been active in
Mirror work for the past year. Miss
Hill was stage manager; Miss Graham
was in charge of the properties; Miss
Burtis headed the costume commit-
tee; Miss Smith was chairman of the
poster committee; Miss Rose assisted
with the costumes; Miss Low took a
leading part in the First Annual Mir-
ror production; Miss Daniel was
chairman of the program committee;
and Wiss Walker headed the publicity
committee.

The new officers will be formally in-
stalled at a dinner for all members of
Mirror, which will be given Thursday
at 6 in the sun parlor of Ida Noyes
halt. Announcement of the production
staff for next year will be made by the
executive board at this time. Mar-
garet Nelson, who is in charge of the
dinner, is in charge of ticket sales.

Hess, Catherine Dupree, Mary Foster,
Jeanette Baldwin, Gertrude Bromberg,

Y. W. C. A. office.

Seniors have come into their own
again.

The traditional senior bench, the
gift of the class of ’96, will once
more be the meeting place of the
fourth year students. Since last
Spring, when work on the Theol-
ogy building and chapel began, the
small stone bench, that for thirty
years had occupied a position of
-eminence on campus, has been rele-
gated to an obscure hiding place on
the side of Cobb hall.

Whether because of the incon-
venience of the out-of-th--way lo-
cation of the bench, or whether be-
cause of “out of sight, out of mind,”
the former symbol of upperclass
prestige was seldom if ever during
this time visited by and senior.
Even the freshman forgot to stop
and look longingly at the forbidden
object.

The new location of the senior
bench, behind the left bulletin board
in front of Cobb, is a change for
the worst from the old spot on the
little slope where the Bond chapel
now stands. However, we’re glad
to get it back anyway and any-
where.

FLOOK WARNS CAMPUS
DRIVERS TO WATCH

‘‘It Won’t Be Long Now ” Says
Bratfish, Senior Whisker Cop

By Leo Stone

“No, sir,” asserted Doc Bratfish, as
he wielded an emphatic razor above
my lathered throat. “The Senior mus-
taches these days ain’t what they used
to be.” I gazed at him indignantly—
the cirility of ’26 was being questioned
—but since I was bearding the tradi-
tional arbiter in his home den, caution
was the better part of holler. “Why,
aren’t we as manly as ever?”

Doc Bratfish, it must be realized, is
no sentimentalist who trades on the
glorious hair-cuts of the past. He was
quick to placate public opinion. “I
mean,” he corrected, “that the boys
are all right, but they aren’t getting a
square deal.*’ *

“Really? Oh, no thanks, I don’t
want a shampoo.”

“Yeh, you see, they aren’t getting
enough time. Two weeks,” he snorted,
the outraged artist, “that’s hardly

enough for side-burns.”

“Really? No, thanks, I hate hair
tonics.”

“Sure, way back in 1910 when they
started the custom the race ran for
six weeks. It was great—every guy
on campus looked like a bum. Then
you don’t want a massage? The orig-
inator of the Mustache race was a
steady customer here. He got the idea
from Cornell, and all his senior friends
joined with him in putting it over
here.”

I blew a soap sud reflectively in the
air. “Tell me, Doc, don’t you think
these seniors in the contest are fat-
heads?”

He thought a moment. “No.”

“But, Doc,” I pursued, as I waved
away the preferred hair singe, “don’t
you think it’s all rather dumb?”

“Dumb?” echoed the dean of Bar-
bers; “Why, no, it’s a tradition!”

The driveway leading to Cobb and
Classics has had to be closed to all
traffic because of the violation of cam-
pus traffic rules which have been very
frequent lately, according to L. R.
Flook, University superintendent of
buildings and grounds. According to
Mr. Flook the campus driveways are
reserved especially for pedestrians.

Violations of campus traffic rules
are always shown by the tagging of
the violating car. The owner of the
car will receive a letter from Mr.
Flook on his first offense, while on his
second he will be asked to visit his

FOUR PROFS. IN

SCIENCE HONOR

National Academy of Sciences
Elects Hektoen, Lillie
Harkins and Bliss

From a five day’s meeting of
National Academy of Sciences,
whose proceedings the eyes of

the
on
the

world have been focused, four Uni-
versity scientists have returned to the
quadrangles, and one has gone to the
other end of the continent to play his
part in the search for scientific truth.
Dr. Ernest Hektoen, chairman of the
department of pathology; Dr. Frank
j R. Lillie, chairman of the department
! of zoology; Dr. William Draper Hark-
ins, adviser to the department of
chemistry, and Dr. G. A. Bliss, pro-
fessor of mathematics,—these four
men are back on the campus from the
convention at the national capital. Dr.
Albert A. Michelson, chairman of the
department of physics, has gone west-
ward to the Mount Wilson observatory
in California, where he will remain for
the Summer engaged in experiment-
ing on the velocity of light.

Election to the National Academy
the highest national honor which
scientist can be given. Dr. Forest

Ray Moulton, chairman of the depart-
ment of astronomy, is the sixth Uni-
versity man holding membership. Dr.
Moulton did not attend the conven-
tion.

Among the speakers of the assemb-
lage was Dr. Harkins, who delivered
a dissertation on the building up of
atoms. He exhibited a photograph ot
the building up of a heavier atom from
lighter ones to illustrate his work.
Prof. Harkins exhibited this photo-
graph for the first time at the Academy
meeting. He recently made the pic-
ture in the Kent laboratories.

Harkins Reveals Science Secrets

More than 60,000 photographs of the

bombardment of
tides have been
istry department
directions. The

gases by alpha par-
taken by the chem-
under Dr. Harkins’
alpha particles are

helium atoms thrown off by radium
and other radio-active minerals in their
disintegration. These alpha particles,
according to Dr. Harkins’ photographs,
leave trails of mist in a moist atmos-
phere, and thus they can be photo-
graphed under powerful light.

Experimentation by the University
savant has shown that in this case the
alpha particle, which has at atomic
weight of 4, struck a nitrogen atom
which has at atomic weight of 18. This
combination would have produced an
atom of fluorine, which has an atomic
weight of 18. From the crash, how-
ever, an atom of hydrogen escaped.
This reduced the combination to an
atomic weight of 17, or, in other
words, turned it into an atom of oxy-
gen.

PROPOSAL TO IMPROVE FRATERNITIES

'T'HE fraternity is the most intimate of college relations. Hence,
-*- it is in a position of great power, and power that classes, chapel
srevices, etc., too often lack. The fraternity can teach its members
many things that they will fail to learn in lecture rooms. But frater-
nities seldom take full advantage of this opportunity.

The fraternity is a successful instrument of self-government, and
a successful foundation of friendships; but it might be even more.
It might become an organized influence for culture. Programs of
stimulating discussion might be devised. There are members, prob-
ably, who would not care for such things; but most fraternities have
plenty who would. Some of the time that is now devoted to the
mechanics of organization—to reports of bulletin committees and
arguments about rushees—might be turned over to a discussion of
books, or a speculation on some of the mysteries of the world, or even
simple practice in the art cl conversation. The change would bring
both profit and (to many) relief from boredom. Some members,
perhaps, would still prefer the routine of chapter politics; the chap-
ter could then be divided into sections, like a convention of learned
men. Those who preferred could distribute themselves in commit-
tees on philosophy, the various sciences, the various arts, etc., ac-
cording to their interests.

Experiments have been made in this direction. Not long ago a
fraternity here gave a successful dramatic performance. Intelligent
programs at Monday night meetings are not uncommon.

IOWA NETMEN DRIVE WAY TO WIN, 4-2

Sigma Nu, Z. B. T., Dekes and Phi Kaps Win I-M Ball Games

SLUG FESTS ARE

ORDER OF DAY’S

PLAY; TILTS FAST

Bus Stevens Hurls Sigma
Nu to 22-2 Victory
Over Phi Delt

The fraternity indoor ball players
hit the stuffed oval far. wide and hand-
some in the official games played on
the sand lot near the Midway yester-
day. A biting cold nipped the players
and officials but the games were spir-
ited though one-Sided.

Sigma Nu in Swat-fest

The Sigma Nu outfit played in the ;
same form which won them the cup
last year when they defeated Phi Delta
Theta 21 to 1. In the other games the
Zeta Beta Tau players gained mo-
mentum as they went along, finally
mustering up enough attack to hum-
ble Phi Beta Delta 9-8; Phi Kappa
Sigma had a field day in trimming the
Chi Psis, 24 to 2; while the Dekes
enjoyed themselves immensely when
they sent the Kappa Sigs home with
a 18 to 6 licking.

Sigma Nu flashed the best brand of
ball during the day. The feature of
the game was the double play com-
bination of Von Pelt to Clark. These
young men executed three of the
double killing kind. Stevens hurled
with dextrity while Viady, pitching for
the losers, was not so baffling. Hoey
and Widman of the Sigma Nu team
wielded the stick slightly better than
their mates and also conducted them-
selves stylishly on the field. The win-
ners took an early lead and stretched
it inning by inning.

Zeta Bttes Snatch Win

The Zeta Betes teased the Phi Betes
by giving the latter a 7 to 0 lead in
the first four innings, but during the
last three frames they snatched a vic-
tory in an ungentlemanly manner by
scoring nine runs. Rothschild, Flex-
ner and Landwirth lead the rally by
bringing in two runs apiece.

Spear with a trio of runs and a per-
fect day in the field, shared honors
with Redden for the Dekes in their
highty-flighty game. Hayes counted
thrice also for the victors. The Phi
Kaps lost no time in getting under
way against the Chi Psis and counted
17 times in the first four innings. Rit-
tenhouse, with four checks after his
name, was the star.

Must Play I-M Golf

the participating teams will be ruled
out of the meet. As yet none of the
scores have been turned in.

All teams are urged to make ar-
rangements with their respective op-
ponents for their matches as soon as
possible. “Speed in playing off the

WHAT p/ IT?

y«OI\« MORGENSTERN

The word is being passed around
that the Chicago track team was not
beaten Saturday by Indiana Univer-
sity, but by Mississippi Agricultural
and Mechanical College. Coach E. C.
Hayes of the Hoosiers, now in his sec-
ond .year at Bloomington, came orig-
inally from the Mississippi school,
where his teams gave evidence of the
fact that track men come bigger and
better in Mississippi than they do in
Indiana,. Until Coach Hayes came to
Indiana, indeed, the Hoosiers never
had a look-in in track. Until this Win-
ter, moreover, they never placed a man
in a Conference indoor or outdoor
championship meet in something like
ten years of running. Often their
teams were so sorry that the univer-
sity authorities kept the boys home
from the Conference meets, thus sav-
ing both money and ignominy at one
and the same time.

Coach Hayes, himself a member of
the Bloomington Rotary and conse-
quently a man of vision, saw how
things were. So he sagely brought
along what he could of his Mississippi
A. & M. team with him when he came
north. The . results are becoming
manifest now. Indiana actually placed
three men in the indoor Conference
and now, with Mr. Stagg’s boys the
victims, won their first dual meet in
many moons.

Pepper, who ran a 0:21 5-10 220 and
won a ten-second hundred Saturday,
Alexander, in the mile and two mile,
Caine, in the quarter and half, and
Prather in the discus are all reputed
to be southern boys come north for
the widely heralded advantages of a
Bloomington education. There may
be more Mississippians on the Indiana
team, and there may be less, but no
matter how many there are, it is hard
to believe they came up just because
old Indiana has the best course in dif-
ferential calculus in this whole en-,
lightened country. But again, perhaps
it was affection for their old coach.

ILLINOIS NINE TO

INVADE MIDWAY

FOR FOURTH TILT

Maroon Squad Set for Win
After Last Minute

Set Back

Coach Lungren’s powerful Illini
nine will invade the Midway tomor-
row' to attempt to hand the Maroons
their fourth straight Conference de-
feat. The downstaters are considered
to be one of the outstanding contend-
ers for the Big Ten title as a result
of their strong showing thus far.

Last Minute Setback

The Maroons are eager to erase the
last minute setback that the aggres-
sive Badgers handed them last Satur-
day. Chicago had a comfortable lead
until the eighth inning when Wiscon-
sin went on a rampage and knocked
Gubbins from the mound. Wallie
Marks was called in from right field,
and Tanger socked the ball into Wood-
lawn Avenue for a double on the first
ball pitched, scoring two runs. The
Badgers also scored three runs in the
ninth to cinch the game, 8 to 5.

Both Get Ten Hits

Both teams got ten hits but Stoll
was more effective in the pinches than
the Maroon hurlers. McCollenn and
Brignail did the best stick work for
the Maroons, while Barnum’s homer
in the ninth with two on featured for
the visitors. Poor base running ruined
many chances for the Maroons to
score. Hoerger singled with none out
in the eighth, but was out trying to
steal second and thus a late rally was
nipped in the bud.

The Maroons should show better in
future starts now that their hitting
has shown decided improvement.

TENNIS HEADS DROP

SINGLES PLAYERS IN

UNPLAYED MATCHES

First round tennis singles in the In-
tramural tournament must be played
off by this Friday afternoon or else
both players forfeit and will be dropped
out of the meet, according to the 1926
tennis manager, Gordon Ross.

“If the opening round is delayed, the
entire tournament becomes mixed up
and the participants lose interest.”
Second round matches will be begun
next week, and by that time all first
round matches must be cleared away.

Intra-mural handball is finally

for the right to play for the campus

The other semi-finals match will
be played off next Thursday after-
noon. The team of Goodman and
Silverman will play Hendrickson
and Taylor. Some time next week
the winners of these two matches
will meet in the finals for the Uni-

it will finally come to a close.

TRACKMEN DOPED

TO BEAT PURDUE

Out To Win After Loss
To Indiana

Unsuccessful in their meet against
Indiana, the Maroon tracksters will
endeaver to avenge the 77 1-3 to 57 2-3
defeat handed them by the Hoosiers
when they meet the comparatively
weak Purdue outfit on Saturday at
Lafayette. Since the Boilermakers
were swamped by Northwestern, the
dope points to a Maroon victory. Burg
should be good for ten points himself
with victories in the high jump and
pole vault. Jimmy Cusack should re-
cover from his poor showing against
the Hoosiers and reel off some fast
mile and half mile runs.

Against Indiana on Saturday, the
Maroons failed to cop a first in the
track events, Pepper of Indiana cop-
ping both the 100 and 220 in fast time.
The big surprise was the defeat of
Cusack by two Hoosier distance men.
Olwin copped the hammer throw with
a heave of 123 feet. The Maroons
scored a slam in the shotput, which
was won by Hobschied. Schabinger
placed second in the javelin with a
pretty hurl of 155 feet. Burg was high
point man in the meet with 11 points,
copping two firsts and a third in the
high jump.

Maroons Lose Both Doubles Matches j Schaeffer, Hall Drop
Singles to Lutz and McClosky, Large
Gallery Watches Meet

By Tom Stephenson

Losing out in both doubles matches
yesterday afternoon cost the Maroon
netters their first match of the season,
Iowa winning by a 4 to 2 count. The
single matches broke even with two
apiece each, but the team contests went
all Haw’keye.

It was a little cold and a bit too
windy for good tennis, but occasional
flashes of brilliancy characterized the
father sloppy play which was as good
as could be expected in the first meet
of the year.

Shapinsky Wins

Shapinsky, thV stellar sophomore,
and Hudlin, National colored cham-
pion, were the two Chicago players to
get a taste of victory in yesterday’s
Big Ten opener. Hudlin won from
Bob Chaffee, clever Iowa netter, by
a 6-3, 6-4 score, and Shapinsky out-
classed Swartz 6-1, 6-2. Captain Wal-
lie Schaeffer was forced to a 6-1, 6-2,
drubbing by the expertness of Lutz,
leader of the Hawkeye quartet, and the
classiest player in yesterday’s games.
McCloskey downed Hall, lank Midway
courtman, in the only three-set con-
test of the singles pairings. Hall
fought an uphill battle to confiscate
the first set by a 8 to 6 game score.
McClosgy came back with a 6 to 3
win, and continued to take the third
set and match by a 6 to 4 score.

third set. Lutz and Swartz were at
first lost under the powerful overhand
drives of Hudlin and the trick return
shots of Shapinsky, but they found
themselves in time to tie up the score
and make it a deuce set. This set
ended in a 8 to 6 win for the Hawk-
eyes. It was Chicago who came back
in the next set to make this another
deuce contest, the Maroons taking it
7 to 5. Then the fatal last set with-
ered all hopes for a Midway victory
when Iowa ran through a 6 to 1 win
with ease.

Schaeffer and Thorpe Drain com-
posed the other doubles team. They
lost to Chaffee and McCloskey in a

The first set was the longest of the
day, going to a 9 to 7 count in favor
of Chaffee and McCloskey. The
Hawkeye duo repeated in the next
frame with a 6 to 1 win, thereby cinch-
ing the match and the meet.

Beyond these earthly shores,
And roam until I’ve settled down
In front of Heaven’s doors.

As angels toll my knell,
“There’s not another place for you
