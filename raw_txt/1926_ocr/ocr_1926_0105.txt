MASON GIVES FIRST IMPRESSIONS

SUNDAY PULLS
OLD STUFF; IT

IS DISCOVERED

David Vaughan Makes Study
of American Church

Revivals

Mr. Billy Sunday, like his brother,
the amoeba, whose relationship he re-
fuses to admit, has been put under
the scientific microscope. He is pull-
ing old stuff, the scientist has dis-
covered.

A dissertation submitted to the de-
partment of systematic theology at
the University by Dr. David D.
Vaughan dissects Billy Sunday and
his fellow evangelists, revealing that
“revivals are not peculiar to America
or to our own time, or even to Christ-
ian communities.

“We find certain common qualities
in extreme forms of religious ex-
pression, in heathen religions, as well
as among Christians who ascribe
their peculiar actions to the influence
of the Holy Spirit.”

Adopt Old Appeal

Mr. Sunday, who makes use of this
age old emotional appeal, helps to
win his crowd by flaunting the popu-
lar prejudices against evolution, edu-
cation, the church and preachers, the
writer continues.

“He calls preachers fudge-eating
mollycoddles and a bunch of stiffs.
He calls church members ‘world-lov-
ing, dancing, card-playing, whiskey-
guzzling. gin-fizzling, wine-sizzling,
novel-reading crowd.’ He says he
would like to stand theological pro-
fessors on their heads in mud pud-

dles.

Pictures Punishing God

“One might summarize the gist of
Mr. Sunday’s message in a terrific
bombardment of sin, the picturing
of a lurid hell, a beautiful heaven, a
real devil, the producing of a real
longing for escape from sin and its
effects, and a longing for peace. Ap-
peals are made to individual and to
family sentiments. Father and
mother are put on the defensive to
savp helpless children from life’s pit-
falls.”

GARIBALDI TAKES
FLING AT CAMPUS
CURRICULUM HERE

Linn Garibaldi, the grand-nephew
of the famous Italian general, was
pledged Chi Psi yesterday.

Garibaldi comes from Charlotte, N.
Carolina and attended Porter Military
School at Charleston, where he
achieved the rank of Senior Captain,
the equivalent of Major. After one
more quarter’s work here at the Uni-
versity he is to receive a commission
as second lieutenant in the Federal Re-
serve Corps.

Garibaldi is registered in the school
of Commerce and Administration. He
is is just entering upon his first quar-
ter at the University, and as his work
at Porter was merely preparatory he is
classified as a Freshman.

The pledging was accomplished early
yesterday afternoon.

GRAD WOMEN HOLD

FIRST TEA SUNDAY

Faculty and graduate students of the
departments of Law, Art, and Social
Sciences have been invited to a tea
to be given Sunday from 3 to 7 in Ida
Noyes hall. This will be one of a series
of teas, held under the auspices of
Mrs. George Goodspeed, director of the
clubhouse, for the purpose of promot-
ing friendly relations between the
faculty and the graduate students of
the University.

\O’Hara Defends
Student Attitude

Toward Studies

Defending the student attitude to-
ward scholarship which was recently
flayed by Prof. W. J. Newlin of Am-
herst college, Frank Hurburt O’Hara,
director of student activities of the
University declared today that Prof.
Newlin’s statements applied to the
few and not to the many.

“Sometimes there are students who
over-participate in activities and stu-
dents who engage in activities merely
to be in them and not because of any
definite interest in the work itself.
However there is a tendency at the
University to concentrate on a cer-
tain one or two activities, as exempli-
fied this quarter by the transference
of his interests from three and one-
half years of intercollegiate football
to concentration on the editorial side
of the Circle on the part of Austin
McCarty.”

Mr. O’Hara refused to comment on
Prof. Newlin’s attack on football.
The Amherst man, speaking on
“Educational Relations with Alumni”
before the convention of the Ameri-
can Association of University Profes-
sors, held at the University last week,
denounced colleges as “football fac-
tories.”

“When a man wins scholastic dis-
tinction he receives a Phi Beta Kappa
key for which he himself pays, but
the man who wins distinction on the
football field is given a gold football,
becomes the social lion of the uni-
versity, and, if he happens to be a
“Red’’ Grange, his financial success
is assured.”

In reply to Prof. Newlin’s declara-
tion that scholastic achievement is
sacrificed to activities, Mr. O’Hara
stated, “The question of relating cur-
ricular to extra-curricular activities
is one to which colleges are giving
constant attention. The tendency to
link activities with classroom work
here at the University is indicated
by statistics of last year which show
that students in publications and
dramatic work have an average of
very respectable standing.”

Undergrad Council

To Discuss Tocques

Whether students will again
wear tocques during the winter to
distinguish their rank and classi-
fication at the University will be
decided Wednesday at the first
meeting of the Undergraduate
council.

The custom of wearing these
tocques of different colors which
has been in vogue for several
years was not enforced last year
and consequently the winter caps
did not appear.

If the Council should decide to
take up the custom again this
year, it will establish a means of
enforcing its edict. The caps will
then be put on sale by the Uni-
versity book store and all students
will be expected to purchase them
and wear them throughout the
quarter.

Y. ESTABLISHES
NEW BULLETIN

Association To Promote
Publicity on Campus

In answer to the attitude of men
of the University that the Y. M. C. A.
has no direct and adequate means
for publishing accounts of its activi-
ties, a Y. Bulletin has been estab-
lished which will appear regularly
throughout the year.

Members of the publicity commit-
tee of both the first and second cab-
inets of the organization are co-ope-
rating in preparing the bulletin. It
is to be distributed among fraternity
houses, men’s dormitories, the Rey-
nolds club, and bulletin boards.

The Y. bulletin contains a program
of events which have been planned
and are to be carried out at once.

Enumerate Activities

The first Y. M. C. A. open house
for 1926 will be held Thursday, Jan.
7, from 4 to 6 in the south lounge of
the Reynolds club. All men of the
University are welcome ot attend and
meet fellow-students.

“Why I believe” is the title of a
series of discussions to be started
Wednesday, Jan. 13 at 4:30, in room
A of the Reynolds club. They will
be held every Wednesday throughout
the quarter. A new leader and a dif-
ferent subject of believe will appear
at each meeting.

Campus groups, fraternities, and
dormitories will consider “Prohibi-
tion, will it work?” as the topic for
the discussion groups for the quarter.

Whitman Hailed

German Gracchus

“Walt Whitman is leading the
Americanization of Europe and in
Germany his ‘Leaves of Grass’ is ac-
cepted as the ‘Bible of Democracy,’ ”
Anna Jacobson of the Hunter college
faculty asserted in speaking at a
group meeting of the Modern Langu-
age Association of America, in ses-
sion at the University last week.

A great wave of Whitman enthu-
siasm has swept over Europe and es-
pecially Germany since the war, ac-
cording to Miss Jacboson, and Ger-
man poets are immitating the Amer-
ican in both style and subject. Com-
ments filled with fervor for Whitman,
made by German writers and critics
were read by the speaker.

Many Germans see in the famous
“Fourteen Points’’ of the late Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson, the voice of
Whitman, speaking for the cause of
liberty throughout the world, Miss
Jacobson asserted.



W. A. A. TO SPONSOR
CAMPUS CONTEST FOR
NEW CHICAGO SONGS

SfeteAefefA

W. A. A. will sponsor a college song
contest to be held Thursday, Jan. 14,
in the gymnasium of Ida Noyes hall.
The purpose of the contest is to com-
pose a peppy and catchy verse that can
take its place with the other University
songs. The need of another song has
long been felt, by the students, accord-
ing to Eleanor Fish, president of W.
A. A., and it is hoped that the contest
will result in the production of a good
song.

The contest will be open to everybody,
the general public included, and the win-
ner will be awarded a $5 gold piece. In
order to prevent discrimination and any
partiality whatever, it has been decided
that all contributions must have the
name and address of the writer on the
reverse side of the song sheet. No.
special type of song has been specified:
any college song will be eligible for
competition. The only specification re-
quired is that the verse must be adapt-
able to music. It need not be original
or new, although those that are of this
kind will probably receive greater at-
tention and consideration, according to
Miss Fish. Judges will be announced
later.

Mrs. Charles Robbins is the insti-
gator of the contest idea. She declared
that the women of the University espe-
cially need more opportunities to get
together and practice college songs.

MAGIC THRIVES
IN RELIGION OF

MODERN TIMES

Dr. Roest, Anthropologist,
Says Magic Art Is Not

Disappearing

A survey of the modern and primi-
tive significance of magic, producing a
new definition of “white magic,” has
been made by Dr. Pieter Roest, in the
department of anthropology at the Uni-
versity.

Pointing out that “magic is the art
of achieving certain desired results by
means of an established series of words
or acts believed to owe their efficiency
to super-physical power,” Dr. Roest de-
clares that magic is certainly not dis-
appearing with the advance of modem
civilization.

Flourishes in Religion

“It flourishes luxuriantly in our or-
ganized religion,” he states, “and while
its primitive interpretation is losing
ground among us, theology firmly clings
to its efficiency whether intelligible or
not, and modern occultists give it an
explanation which outdoes even science
in rationalization.”

“The practical aid of white magic
is not essentially different in primitive
society from that practiced in our own
civilization. On the theoretical side
tl-e differences are greater, yet the most
fundamental beliefs—in super-physicial
power, and in an invisible world in
which the spiritual beings wield this
power—are everywhere the same. Uni-
versal is also the distinction of the
beneficent from maleficent magic, al-
though the churches apply the name
‘magic’ only to the latter.”

Symphony Concert
Held Today; Give
Balanced Program

The Chicago Symphony Orchestra
will hold its concert today at 4:15
in Mandel hall. All patrons who have
tickets are urged to attend, but if
for any reason this is impossible, it
will be appreciated if they will ex-
tend to friends the use of their tic-
kets or submit them to the office of
the association to be sold again.

Program

1.	Prelude to “Haensel and Gretel”
	 Engelbert	Humperdinck

(1854-1921)

Humperdinck, who, in his student
days, seems to have won at least half
of all the musical scholarships of
Europe, was one of those modem
German composers somewhat con-
temptuously labeled “post-Wagner-
ian.” Of all of Humperdinck’s works
“Haensel and Gretel” is by far the
best known. It is a fairy opera based
on a German fairy tale, and its music
is composed largely of German folk
songs.

Humperdinck’s last important com-
position was the musical score of
“The Miracle,” shortly to be played
here.

2.	Suite “Sheherezade”......

FRANKENSTEIN GIVES
CLARINET PROGRAM

Alfred V. Frankenstein, a student
at the University, will give a demon-
stration of the clarinet and the bass
clarinet at the concert-lecture today at
3:15 in Mitchell Tower.

Frankenstein, who is music critic for
The Daily Maroon, is a clarinetist with
the Civic Orchestra of Chicago. His
“Syncopating Saxophones,” recently
published treatise on modern jazz has
won commendation from prominent
critics.

Freshmen Rival

Heinz in Variety;

57 of ’em Enter

Fifty-seven men and women,
. equipped with class tickets, pamph-
lets, books, and what not, were ob-
served yesterday seeking their way
among the unfamiliar buildings.
These fifty-seven were the new en-
tering freshmen, coming in the wake
of over nine hundred registered for
the autumn quarter.

Owing to the smallness of the
number matriculating, no elaborate
plans or systems were used to receive
the newcomers formally. Signs ap-
peared on the campus, directing the
new students to the various buildings.

Very little trouble was encountered
in either Examiner’s or Recorder’s
office. The Information and Cashier’s
offices were kept busy all day.

ANNUALSALES

DRIVEOPENED

New Partial Payment Plan
For Yearbook

The second Cap and Gown sales
drive of the current year began yes-
terday, according to John Hopkins,
business manager of the annual. The
price for this quarter will be $4.50,
which will be payable in two install-
ments, one dollar down and the bal-
ance when the book is delivered. This
partial payment plan is new this year
and is expected to increase the sales
considerably.

All the campus women’s clubs have
entered a contest for the best selling
record of the quarter. Almost all
club members are now authorized to
sell subscriptions, and the rivalry be-
tween the clubs is keen. The sub-
scriptions are on sale in the cloak-
room of Ida Noyes, the checkroom
of the Reynolds club, and at the Cap
and Gown office. Any member of the
staff can furnish information as to
subscriptions.

According to Hopkins, the editorial
work of the Cap and Gown is being
done thoroughly, and as rapidly as is
consistent with care. The staff thinks
that this year’s book will live up to
the standard set by the volumes of
previous years.

“If the University is to win the cup
for which Northwestern and Illinois
are also competing, every member of
the undergraduate body must back
the Cap and Gown staff by buying
his or her copy of the annual,” said
HopkinS.

Sun Spots Now

Visible to Eye

Spots on the sun, one group about
112,000 miles long, and the other
about 85,000 are today visible to the
naked eye, through a smoked glass,
Prof. Edwin B. Frost, director of the
Yerkes observatory of the University
reports. The same groups were vis-
ible around Thanksgiving time, the
sun having made one rotation in the
meantime.

The phenomenon is accompanied
by the northern lights, flashes from
the aurora having been observed at
the Yerkes observatory. Daily ap-
pearances of the northern lights, very
early in the morning, are reported by
Prof. Frost. He says that there have
been more and larger sun spots in
the last two months than have been
expected, as it is only two years since
the minimum, when they were scarce
and small. No appreciable effect on
the weather has yet been recognized
with definiteness at the ouseivatury.

Undergraduate
Council to decide
on tocques to-
morrow.

SERIOUS TONE
OF UNIVERSITY

CITEDBY PRES.

Pres. Mason Interviewed By
Reporter On Work

of Quarter

“My most prominent impression has
been of the underlying seriousness of
tone of the University and its student
body. I don’t mean by this solemnity,
but those of the students whom I have
met seem to be unusually alive to the
real value of University training. I re-
gret that my acquaintance with the stu-
dent body and the work of the quad-
rangles is still extremely inadequate.”

Thus spoke President Mason of the
University as he reviewed his experi-
ences during his first quarter. After a
busy day of conferences about all sorts
of things the reporter caught him as
he was leaving the loop offices of the
University Development Committee.

Work Under Handicap

“I feel that the things which the Uni-
versity has been working toward are go-
ing to have a profound influence in the
future. The remarkable work of the
University has in many cases been done
under extreme handicaps. We all are
most keenly alive to the fact that the
coming year will give us an answer one
way or another to the question of in-
creased endowment, which is absolutely
vitai to the maintenance of the Chicago
standard of excellence.”

Wants to Know Students

President Mason, when asked for his
impression of the student body, said:

“When the rush of this campaign is
over I want to know more of the stu-
dents—where they live and how—I want
to enjoy them—to know something of
their organization. I have a strong
feeling that the enormous benefits of
college life lie in the group activities of
the undergraduate body. I look forward
with intense pleasure to the time when
I will know more of the students per-
sonally.”

“MR. PIM PASSES BY”
PRESENTED TO CLUB
BY CAMPUS PLAYERS

“Mr. Pim Passes By,” the comedy
that proved so popular on the campus
of the University, will be presented
tomorrow morning at 10:30 in the
Fine Arts building under the auspices
of the University Woman’s club. Its
reappearance is the result of a re-
quest made by the dramatic depart-
ment of the club.

“Another indication of the Univer-
sity Woman’s club, the
results of which have always been
friendly, begin as far back as the
time when Nancy Foster hall was
built, the members of the Womans’
club contributing several hundred
thousands of dollars,” according to
one of the production heads.

Fred Handschy plays the leading
role, and if the former popularity
that the play had is any criterion, it
will “go over big.”

MAROON CALLS FOR
FRESHMAN WOMEN

Reportorial positions in the Worn- ,--
ens’ department of The Daily Maroon
are still open to applicants. Only
freshman women interested in journal-
ism will be considered for the posts.
Applications may be made any day this
week, between 2 JO and 3:30. to Ger-
trude Bromberg, Woman’s editor, in
the office of The Daily Maroon, Room
2, Ellis haff.

A STRANGE INTERVIEW

“TXTHAT is your name?" we asked, after we had seated the young
’ * stranger by our fire.

He was an innocent-looking lad with a rosy face. He wore a
highly-figured slipover sweater, and very wide trousers. He might
have been in his third year at high school. His voice had but lately
changed.

"1 haven’t a name," said he. "You see, they only gave me a
number. Nineteen-twenty-six, I believe.”

“Ah, yes,” we said. “We’ve heard of you.”

He was pleased. “Everybody knows me,” he cried. “You know,
they treat me splendidly here. You should have seen the reception
they gave me the other night. Bells, whistles, toasts—by the gallon,
I’ll bet. A great place—” his eyes glowed—“and splendid people.
So cordial. They’ll do anything to make me feel at home .Every one
of them shook hands with me, and told me all the nice things he’s
going to do this year. Some of them have long lists, written out on

paper. They’re not going to get drunk;
they’re not going to scold their wives;
they’re going to do all their work on
time—they’re going to do a hundred
other things—just to make it a pleas-
ant year for me. I tell you”—he had
jumped to* his feet; he was dancing
the Charleston on our hearth—“I tell
you it’s going to be the happiest year
of my life.”

We pitied this enthusiastic young-
ster. Here he stood, dancing on the
threshold of life, overjoyed, hilarious
—because of New Year’s resolutions.
Was it not our duty to disillusion him?
He would soon learn how much these
trusted resolutions were worth, and
how well his beloved human race kept
its promises .... Fickle race, .we
mused; how many hearj^ you have
broken, as you are about to break this.

We had not the courage to shatter
our young guest’s dream. We tried to
speak; we made many bold beginnings.

But always
nerved us.

Presently
grasped his

the twinkle in his eye un-

he arose to leave. We
hand.

“Wait,” we said. “Weve something
to show you. It’s a list, you see of
the ^things we’re going to do this year.
Listen.

“(1) IVe will never allow the ads to
crowd out the Whistle.

“(2) IVe trill never praise a show, or
boost a dance, in the hope of (jetting a
complimentary ticket.

“(3) We will give our readers more
interesting reading and less filler.

“(4) IVe trill never misspell words
and blame the proofreader.

“(5) IVe unit write our editorials on
time: we wont keep the printer trailing.

“(6) IVe will never—”

The boy was gone. He was an im-
patient fellow; we had noticed that
from the beginning. We were alone,
and our fire was almost out.

Despite the loss of its three vaca-
tion practice games, the Maroon five
has shown considerable potential abil-
ity and should win its share of confer-
ence games in the coming campaign.

The Michigan Aggie quintet opened
the season and trimmed the Maroons
28 to 21 with a last minute rally after
the locals had the best of the playing
throughout the greater par of he strug-
gle. The Maroons were handicapped
by he fact that Hoerger, McConne!,

Ames came here Dec. 30 and nosed
out the Maroons 22 to 21 in one of the
most thrilling contests seen on Bartlett
floor in years. I long shot in the final
second of play decided the closely
contested tilt. The Maroons were lead-
ing 20 to 16 with three minutes of
play when the Iowa State forwards
peppered the basket with lucky long
shots, and annexed a victory.

Jan. 4, the powerful Drake team
came here and handed Norgren's pro-
teges their third straight setback to
the tune of 27 to 20. The Bulldogs,
conquerors of Illinois, have one of the
speediest and most polished teams in
the west.

Led by Chuck Everett, who Coach
Ruby of Illinois has declared to be one
of the best basketball players he has
ever seen, the Towans ran up a total
of 16 points in the first while the
Maroons were held to a lone basket.
The half ended 16 to 4.

Locals Rally

The second half was an entirely dif-
ferent story. The Maroons got going
and with Alyea and Zimnjerman sink-
ing long shots and Wallie Marks and
Sackett contributing spectacular one-
handed shots the Maroons almost out-
stripped their rivals, but the heavy
score against them was to big to over-
come. The Maroons showed a skillful
handling of the ball and a tighter
defense in. the second half.

Saturday, Sam Barry’s highly-touted
Hawkeye five will meet the Maroons
in the first conference game for both
teams at Bartlett Gym. The Hawkeyes
have lost but one practice tilt thus far
and that to Notre Dame by one point.
Iowa boasts a veteran team and on
past performances have a decided edge
on the Midwayites. It is possible
that George iLott, who is ineligible,
may become eligible in time for the
Iowa tilt.

Lott May Play

If the tennis star will not be able to
play, Norgren will undoubtedly start
the same team that opened against
Drake, which includes Alyea at center,
Marks and Zimmerman at the for-
wards, and McDonough and Hoerger
the two husky sophomore stars at
the guards. McDonough is troubled
with a bad foot and an injury to his
hand, and if he is unable to play,
Marks will shift over to guard with
Sackett functioning at forward. Mack-
lind and McConnell may also get a
chance to perform.

Your last quarter’s “C” Book
may now be exchanged for the
Winter Quarter Issue, by present-
ing it at the Athletic Office^ loc-
ated on the first foor of Bartlett
Gym. Attend to this sometime be-
fore Saturday, as Friday has been
set as the last day.

The office opens at nine and
closes at five o’clock sharp. Ths
new books are required for ad-
mittance to the important basket-
ball game with Iowa, next Satur-
day evening, and so a big rush for
the books is anticipated on the last
day at the last minute. Save your-
self a great amount of time and
standing in line by redeeming your
old book as soon as possible.

ENCAGE VARSITY

The swim team is all set for the
oncoming meets which will be pre-
ceded by the Freshman-Varsity fray
of Friday night next. The Varsity
crew’s prospects look exceptionally
bright for the coming season and they
will probably better the Freshman
tankers with ease. Cornie Oker will
be one of the outstanding stars Friday
night being predicted with Harry Har-
kins to take first in several events.

Among the Varsity mainstays Cap-
tain Ed. Noyes, Ed. Fellinger and
Harry Rittenhouse will be the star
performers of the evening. The varsity
breastroke team consisting of Mygdal,
Florez and Diamond will have a hard
time battling against Harkins for su-
premacy, while Bob Markley will have

Oker.
Tudor
dives
cham-

Greenburg will be the only threat in
the longer grinds in favor of the Var-
sity and should take the leading place
with ease.

The Freshman-Varsity contest will
be of great help to Coach MacGillivray
since it will help him in polishing off
the rough spots of his aquatic proteges

in finished form for
The men are eager
the Indiana natators
able to judge their

speed according to their times Friday
night.

According to MacGillivray, Proth-
eroe and Jenkins, former stars will de-
fend honors for the Freshmen Alumni
combinations and will offer consider-
able resistance to the Varsity’s attack.

Indiana will be the first swim team
to cross the path of the Maroon tank-
me;i, and although the former was
vanquished by Michigan Friday last,
she showed signs of estrength and
will try to make amends by upsetting
the Chicago swimmers.

The students are invited to witness
the local meet Friday and to show that
the campus is behind them, the pool
holds 5000, so come on!

’WARREN PIPER AGO

31 M. STATE ST.



OF JOHNSON AS

MAROON TRAINER

Loyalty and Service Has
Been Seldom Equalled
at Chicago

By Ted Iserman

(Former member of the staff of

the

Daily Maroon who has known Johnny
Johnson intimately for the past seven
year.)

When Nicholas B. (Johnny) John-
son died a fortnight ago, the Univer-
sity of Chicago athletic department lost
a man whose loyal service to the in-
stitution which employed him is seldom
equalled. That loyalty to the school,
and the earnestness with which John-
ny trained the men who have worn
the Maroon during the twenty years
that he has been at the University, won
for him warm spots deep in the hearts
of this and many previous generations
of Chicago athletes.

Johnny Johnson was hugely inter-
ested in his work: he was hugely in-
terested in the welfare of the men who
were under his care; he was as hugely
devoted to the University of Chicago.
His studious application to. his job
made him the best equipped trainer
of college athletes in America, and put
Chicago in the lead in installing mod-
ern training facilities.

Johnny was as attentive to the moral !
and spiritual health of his men as he j
was to their physical well being.

Johnny was horn in Wisconsin near
a helf century ago, coming to the Uni-
versity a score of years ago. After a
year in charge of the athletic depart- I
ment locker room here he was put in
charge of the training of the Maroon [
athletes.

will be the only chance given to senior
college women to get in trim for posi-
tions on the class teams, which will be
chosen in the next month. Practice
games wil he held every Tuesday and
Thursday.

All women who are* interested in this
particular sport have been urged to sign
up for it as soon as possible, according
to Eleanor Fish, president of W. A. A.
It offers a good opportunity for women
who wish to become members of this
organization, but who have not been
able to earn the necessary hundred points
to gain membership.

Wrestlers Are Ready
For Practice Meets

Coach Vorres has rounded his
wr estling team into shape by more
than a month of intensive grap-
pling with fundamentals, so that
his men are now ready for the an-
nual practice tilts which always
preceed the Big Ten matches.
These tilts which serve' to polish
up the matmen for the big meets,
are scheduled with local Athletic
Clubs; so that the Maroons have
two or more matches a week up
until the Conference Dual Meets
begin.

The first Big Ten opponent this
year is Minnesota, who comes to
Batlett Gym on Feb. 6. Other
dual meets are scheduled with Wis-
consin, Illinois, and Iowa. The
season is to be concluded at the
Conference Championship Meet to
be held at Purdue sometime in
March.

LOOK FOR CLOSE

CAGE TITLE RACE

This year’s Conference race has all
the earmarks of turning out to be one
of the most heated and closely con-
tested of many years. There are many
outstanding teams. Ohio State last
year’s champ having lost four men
from last year’s outfit still has a strong
team with “Cooky” Cunningham, Red
Sieffer, and Johnny Dempsey as a
nucleus. Michigan, with a host of
sophomores and plenty of veterans
which includes Bo Molenda, Ben Oos-
terbaan, Capt. Doyle. Chambers, and
Red Cherry, a better guard than whom
there is not has about one of the classi-
est teams in the Big Ten.

Indiana and Purdu^,
for their good teams,
teams again this year,
cially has an all veteran

always noted
have strong

Indiana espe-
team that can

certainly play basketball. Iowa has a
crack team with Harrison and Van
Deusen being their star performers,
and Hogan a guard that played in the
National interschalastic with Osage,
Iowa, playing a great game.

I like ’em.

I like ’em

And sometimes to a candy shop

And crack my ribs, and muss my hair

HELD TODAY; GIVE
BALANCED PROGRAM

(Continued from page 1)

..........N. A. Rimski-Korsakov
(1844-1908)

Rimski-Korsakov, who, thanks to
Paul Whiteman, is known throughout
the length and breadth of the land as
the composer o' “The Song of India,-’
wrote “Shehertzade,” a suite illustra-
tive of the Arabian Nights stories, in
1888. He gave each movement of
the suite a title. Those titles are:

1.	The Sea and Sinbad’s Ship.

2.	The
Princess.

3.	The
Prince.

4.	The

Young Prince and Young

Narrative of the Kalendar

Festival et Bagdad. The

Sea. The Ship Goes to Pieces on a
Rock Surmounted by a Bronze Horse.

Rimski-Korsakov later withdrew
these titles, so their use here is en-
tirely unofficial. The suite is tied to-
gether by the use of a motto theme,
played generally as a cadenza in a
solo violin, which signifies Shehere-
zade telling her wonderful tales.

The first theme of the second move-
ment, the theme of the young prince
and young princess, was used in the
Blackfrairs’ show of 1921 (“The
Machinations of Max”) in a song of

a serving maid.

Jean Sibelius
(1865-)

The name of Jean Sibelius is not
so well known to American audiences
as it should be. Sibelius, probably
the greatest of all Finnish composers,
is beyond doubt one of the five lead-
ing composers of the present day.
His six symphonies and his many
symphonic poems, (most of which
are based on Finnish sagas) are, in
the words of an English authority:
“sometimes weird and wild, some-
times of a mysterious, penetrating
sweetness, often majestic, bold, and
infinitely sad.”
