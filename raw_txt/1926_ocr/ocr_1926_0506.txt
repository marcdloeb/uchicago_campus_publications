Election of Alta Cundy, society
editor of The Daily Maroon, to the
position of head score saleswoman
for the annual Blackfriar show,
“Wallie Watch-Out,” was announced
yesterday by the Black friar Board
of Superiors..

Miss Cundy will appoint her staff
of saleswomen immediately. Sales
will be on a competitive basis, the
girl selling the greatest number of
scores winning the honor of choice
for head of the staff next year.

Miss Cundy is a member of the
Mortar Board club. She has long
been active in dramatics, having
been production manager of Mirror
and the Settlement Night vaudeville I
this year. As one of the few women |
associated with the production of.
Blackfriar plays, she has given valu-
able assistance in the publicity de-'
partment in the past. Miss Cundy
was one of the leaders of the recent
Military Ball, and she will be a lead- J
er of the forthcoming Interclass Hop.
During her Freshman year, she was,

If Lee Neff, the great Phi Psi
candidate for enduring fame, had
not been handicapped by his attack
of the mumps he would have run
the mustache race in a walk—so
runs the opinion of the experts,
Doc Bratfish included.

With the great Neff removed
from the field through his illness,
expert opinion is hard put to it to
find the probable victor. Latest
reports from one party have it
that nothing can keep Tom Mulroy
from the title, while another
group of well informed men are
backing Sew Covert to the last.

But there are two other import-
ant men in the field—John Bar-
ton, the white hope of Kappa Sig-
ma, and Ad Wilson, who is said to
be waxing his twenty hairs daily.
Wilson’s pride and joy has already
started to curl around the ends of
his mouth. The savants say that
this is a sign of great possibilities.

College women, with or without

“Experience is a minor factor

II.

to-
for

journalistic work,” continued Mrs.
Herrick. “In the past, city editors
were always asking for several years
of experience as the ‘open sesame’ to
the newspaper world. Today, the es-
sential thing is writing ability.

“Since each paper employs only
two or three women reporters as
against some twenty men, it is much
more difficult for the former to get
on the staff. However, when once
on, they are helped along more con-
sistently than are the men, probably
because they are fewer in number. It
is no achievement for a woman to
receive a by-line within three months
of her entrance.”

Mrs. Herrick insisted that women
should not strive to cover the same

By Leonard Bridge*

A country club party with lots of
lanterns, the Ida Noyes gym to dance
I in, and the whole building and
grounds to wander through—such a
party is promised those who go to the
Inter-Class Hop to be staged on
May 28.

Those in charge of this dance have
been searching for new ideas and
according to reports they have suc-
ceeded. Never before has Ida Noyes
—that is, all of it—been used for any
dance, and never before have the
leaders of the Inter-Class Hop
thought of disguising their dance as
a country club party.

Have New Idea*

But other new ideas have been
evolved for the occasion. While danc-
ing goes on in the gymnasium very
elaborate refreshments will be
served. These refreshments have
been prepared under the personal
supervision of the leaders. Rumor
has it that no limit will be set to the

land, Donald M. Lockett, and [
Mr. Frank H. O’Hara will be I
guests of honor at the Mirror
dinner tonight at 6 in the sunparlor
of Ida Noyes hall. All assisted in the
First Annual Mirror production, Mrs.
Woodward as general advisor, Miss
Durbrow as director of the dancing,
Miss Sutherland as general manager
during 1926, and M. O’Hara as gen-
eral director. Don Lockett was pres-
ident of the Dramatic Association
when Mirror was formed last year
and Mirror has since been taken into
the Dramatic Association.

Parker Hall and Betty Graham
have been giving the best orchestras
their critical attention during the
last week in order to find one good
enough to equal the decorations at
this party. For if the high standard
set by the decorations committee is
not applied to every department the
leaders are convinced that their best
efforts will be rewarded with an aw-
ful flop. This, they agree, would
be lamentable.

Said Graham Hagey, one of the
leaders, when asked just how good
the party was going to be: “No one
will be able to recognize the interior
of Ida on that night. We are going
to decorate the grounds too, but the
main stress will of course be put on
the interior.” This opinion has the
support of the other leaders.

w

E reprint the following excerpt from an article in The New Stu-
dent, because we agree that college comics have wandered too

far from college, that some of them are now coming home to roost,
and that they had better.

“What then is the next step? Where will the long fight for
— student independence break forth anew? There is every indication
that it will be in the pages of the now almost universally despised
and often completely juvenile “college comics.”

“These same comics are now in sorry state. Consisting almost
entirely of stale jokes, weak puns, and ‘He and She’ conversations,
they are with a few exceptions slavish imitators of Life, Judge and
Captain Billy’s Whizbang, although entirely lacking in that technical
skill which makes these latter publications worth the trouble of turn-
ing the pages. College comics run jokes on Mother-in-Laws, Income
Taxes, Cannibal Islands, and other matters of which they can know
nothing. It does not take an intelligence much above that of the
average collegian to figure out that, while a college student s opinion
on the Mother-in-Law question is not worth the paper it is printed
and drawn upon, a college student s satiric, ironic, or merely humor-
ous view of the faculty, the student council and education in general
is as well worth expressing with drawing board and pencil in the
comic as with editorial comment in the newspaper. It can be done
with just as good effect. Perhaps better. The pencil with a single
line can show that which takes the typewriter many weary hours.”

their tickets early, as only two hun-

reduction in the numbtr of guests

Just get yourself a jimmy-pipe and fill the

P. A. can’t bite your tongue or parch your

ANNOUNCE PLANS
FOR BIG SPRING

ATHLETIC REVUE

May 27th and 28th Named
As Dates of 1926
Revue

It won’t be long now. The big
Spring Carnival, sponsored by the
Intramural Department, and man-
aged this year by William Weddel,
is less than a month away. It will
be held on the afternoons of Thurs-
day and Friday, May 27th and 28th.

According to Weddel, every effort
is being made to hold the meet on
Stagg Field despite the heavy build-
ing program now occupying that old
land mark in the construction of the
new Stadium. It would be very
fitting to hold the Spring Classic as a
farewell tribute to this famous track
and field, and Weddel is to have the
cooperation of the whole department
in making it possible.

. Thirteen Event* Carded

There are to be thirteen events |
this year, all of the familiar track
and field events being included on
the program. An 880 yd. relay be-
tween the fraternities will feature
the meet, with the Delta Sigma Phi
team defending the laurels which i
they won last year.

Many ^organizations have started
practicing for this feature event on
the I-M spring sport program and |
the climax to whole year of Intra-
mural activities. Intensive training
for the big carnival characterizes the
close competition which exists every
year, and all organizations should
get started at one if they have not,
already done so.

Trackmen Meet
Purdue for First
Dual Meet Win

Chicago track stars will compete
against Purdue on next Saturday,
May 8, in the second dual meet of
the season. Twenty-eight will jour-
ney to LaFayette to meet the Boil-
ermakers.

The coming of the warm weather
has greatly improved Chicago’s
strength. McKinney and Mickle-
berry, the two sprint aces, are ex-
pected to shine in the 100 and the
220. Capt. Cusack has been trans-
ferred from the mile, and will run
the quarter and the half against
Purdue. Fast time tryouts were
made yesterday by -Hegovic and
Boynton in the half, Hitz and Kelso
in the mile, and Dugan, Dystrup, and
Keinigsberg in the two mile.

Capt. Henderson of last year’s
football team is working out in the
weights along with Rouse, and both
men are expected to better 120 feet
in the discus. Olwin and Soloma-
witz and Wolf will throw the ham-
mer, while Hobscheid will compete
in the shot. Shavinger and Fauche
will represent the Maroons in the
javelin.

Burg is expected to keep up his
record as high point man. Last week
against Indiana he won first in the
high jump and pole vault, and third
in the broad jump. McKinney is
also expected to shine. Last year
he scored a total of 20 points against
Purdue, winning the 220, the 120
yard high hurdles, the low hurdles,
and the broad jump. Kernwein may
also compete in the broad jump as
well as the high jump.

OPENING GAMES

Delta Sigs Bunch Hits
and Beat Tau

Delts

Balmy, ideal baseball weather
proved to be a stronger pull for the
intra-mural players than the popular-
ity of the Illini-Maroon game yester-
day afternoon and four of the six
games on the schedule sheet were
played off. Only one forfeit —Snell
to the Packers,—and one postpone-
ment—by agreemnt between the
Macs and the Pirates, were the
scratch outs on the score book.

In the first game, featured by ex-
pert fielding by both sides. Delta Sig-
ma Phi batted its way to a 6 to 1
win Tau Delta Phi. Gaskill was a
big factor in the Delta Sigs machine
striking out eight men during the
game. In the first inning he retired
all three of the first men up to bat.
Weiss played a fine game at field
for the Tau Delts making three ex-
traordinarily difficult spears. The win
enabled the Delta Sigs to maintain
their league, lead.

Mac*-Pirate* Postpone

The Macs and the Pirates instead
of putting up two teams apiece have
decided to play only one team each
so that their game was postponed
in order to give them time to make
up the new outfit. The Law School
beat out the Theological Seminary
in a fast game by the close score of
8 to 5. The barristers poled out six
runs in the third inning to put the
game almost on the ice. In the sixth

Canadian Track MAROONS SURPRISE ILUNI TEAM TO
Squads Send in ANNEX INITIAL VICTORY IN THRILLING
Tourney Entries FOURTEENTH AFTER GRUELLING TILT

From all parts of the United States
and Canada, high school track stars
are making preparations to enter the
National Interscholastic Track and
Field Meet at Chicago. Hamilton In-
stitute of Hamilton, Ontario, is again
planning to enter a team. Two years
ago the Canadian school entered a
strong group of tracksters and this
year their entry is looked upon as
being one of the outstanding ones in
the meet. North Battlefield, Saska-
tuan is another Canadian entry.
Three or four men are expected to
represent the blue at Chicago June
5th. Tucumcari, New Mexico, has
the honor of being the first team to
enter from the United States.

The addition of three new relay
events to the High School program
will be a feature to this year’s meet.
The events will be a half mile relay,
in which each man will run a 220,
a mile relay, in which each man will
run a 140 and two mile relay, in
which four men will run an 880. The
addition of these events will add
greatly to the interest of the meet,
for it is expected that the best high
school relay teams will journey from
all parts of the country to test their
ability for the National Champion-
ship. It will also allow teams with-
out individual stars of great note to
figure in the final point standing.

In 1923, with two outstanding in-
dividual wins and a relay victory,
University High School won the Na-
tional title with 20 points. In 1924
the well balanced Cedar Rapids. Iowa
team won with 25 points. In 1925
Fort Collins, Colo., with a team of
fourteen men, carried away the hon-
ors with 20 1-2 points.

Two Wild Pitches Advance Brignall from Second to Home
With Winning Counter; Both Squads
Held Scoreless from 7th On

(Continued from page 1)
hoisted the ball over the wire fence in
left field for two bases, making it
possible for two runs to clatter over
the plate. Stewart replaced Barrett
in the second and he was as tight as
a vase for a few innings.

But in the fifth frame the Maroons
crossed the pan three times. Ander-
son led off by getting on first through
fast leg work. Macklind sacrifice
and McConnell spanked a single over
second base. Kyle rambled home on
the hit. Brignail lifted another one
for two bases, and followed Mc-
Connell over the plate when Gubbins
banged one on the nose.

Illinois began their run-harvesting
in the fifth when Marks presented the
down-staters with four gift passes,
which resulted in a score. For the
Maroons three singles added to an
error equalled one score.

With the count 6 to 1 and the
Maroons on the cheerful side of it,
O’Keefe formally opened the seventh
with a twobase smack. Gubbins re-
placed Marks when Jordan was
walked. Gubbins was also as wild as
a kite and spent the rest of the inn-
ing attempting to find the plate. The
Illinois men wore ruts around the
basepaths as five runs were forced
in, tieing the scoring.

Gubbins was in all kinds of trou-
ble until the final round when Brig-

nall got on through an error and
scored as a result of a sacrifice and
two passed balls. The box score:

how well they both looked that eve-

Ballade of The Two—Both Hungry

We were hungry—O so hungry,
And our throats were parched with
thirst;

We were longing for a sandwich
Or a piece of weenie-wurst.

Then we walked into a Food Shop
And we sat down at a table,
But some girls we knew sat near us;

So, as fast as we w'ere able.
We rose and left our foodstuffs,
Clean forgot the hungry feeling,
And ran until our tongues hung out,
And both of us were reeling.

Oh, its tough when you are famished,
And your appetite is cheated,
