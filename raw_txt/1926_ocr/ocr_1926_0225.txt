JUNIORS CHOOSE
CANDIDATES FOR

COUNCIL POSTS

To Elect Two Men and Two
Women to Student Council

At Chapel Wed.

Two men and two women will he
selected by the Junior class, in chapel
assembly, from among the seven men
and three women nominated in
chapel yesterday, to act as their re-
presentatives on the Undergraduate
council until the graduation of the
class. The elections will occur in
Junior chapel next week.

The nominees are: men, V. Frank
Coe, Gifford Hitz, Wendell Bennett,
John Howe, John Myer, Deemer Lee,
and Joe Gubbins; women, Marjorie
Cooper, Esther Cook, and Eunice
Hill.

Elect To Honor Commission

Elections to the Honor Commission
will take place on the day preceding
the elections to the Undergraduate
council, that is, next Tuesday at
Sophomore chapel. Two men and
two women will be sent to this body
by the sophomores.

A preliminary report on the Prom
was turned in to the council at its
meeting yesterday by Lucy Lamon
and Catherine Campbell, who were
supervising it for that body.

Discuss Coming Elections

The forthcoming elections were
discussed from all angles, and pro-
vision made for handling them pro-
perly. The council voted to continue
barring reporters from the The Daily
Maroon in spite of the action of the
Board of Student Publications, who
were unanimous in their decision to
admit them.

Charles Anderson, president ot
the council, who has recently return-
ed from the Mid West Student Con-
ference in New Orleans, discussed
that meeting from the point of view
of those interested in collegiate self-
government.

One of the men elected from the
junior class to serve until graduation
will be elected president in April, and
one of the women will be elected
secretary-treasurer.

The four Juniors elected will im-
mediately take their positions as
members of the Council and will
serve until June, 1927.

Boucher Is Back
To Work Again

True to Mrs. Boucher’s prediction,
Prof. Chauncey S. Boucher, Acting
Dean of the Colleges, was able to re-
turn to his activities yesterday, un-
dergoing a slight attack of the
grippe. He was only away from his
desk for a short time as he was taken
ill Saturday after leaving his office
and returned yesterday morning.

“I am feeling as well as could be
expected under the circumstances,”
said Mr. Boucher when interviewed
yesterday. In answer to the remark
that the office of the Dean of Col-
leges was a “hoo-doo” he said, “Oh
no, I merely succumbed to that light
form of influenza or grippe that
seems to be going around at pre-
sent.” He added that he realized
that many of the absences which are
so commonly looked upon with sus-
picion are in fact “bought and paid
for.”

Chicago Delegate Reports
On Night Sessions,
Mardi Gras, Etc.

By George Morgenstern

Chuck Anderson is home again.
Mr. Anderson, you recall, was Chi-
cago’s delegate to the sixth annual
Midwest Student conference at
Tulane. Tulane is in New Orleans,
and New Orleans is where the Mardi
Gras goes on (in fact, was going on
when Charles was there). Report
has it that sundry other things go on
there, too. On this, nf course. I can-
not speak.

But to get back to the matter in
hand, Mr. Anderson is back, and re-
ports that Chicago may feel thor-
oughly satisfied that he did all that

could be
the good
ventions,
followed

work usually done at con-

I believe that a report has
Charles home to the effect

that he stood up for Chicago with the
best of them. This is commendable;
it is to be hoped that Chicago is al-
ways represented at these confer-
ences by men of mettle, by men of
stomach.

Extend Scope of
Personnel Work
With Freshmen

The
species
world;

By Betty McGee

Freshman is a different
from everything else in the
therefore he must be dealt

with in a special way. This is the
opinion of authorities at Yale Col-
lege and the reason for the establish-
ing of a Freshman College. This col-
lege is separate and distinct from
the other colleges, with a Freshman
dean and the finest teachers of
Freshmen on the faculty.

Realization of this peculiarity of
the Freshman has also led to work
along this line at the University.
Personnel work, which was begun
some years ago, has been consider-
ably extended this year. In addition
to the deans, graduate students in
Religious Education have been ap-
pointed as Freshmen Advisors. Each
graduate student has been given 60
to 70 Freshmen whom he associates
with, advises, and entertains in his
home. The University will continue
this policy and increase the number
of advisers each year.

This personnel work aims to aid
a philosophy of College Education
that shall not only give the college
ultimate goals, but point out the next
step.

Terrible Turk Plans Struggle with

R.H.L.; Organizes ‘Whistle Club

They’re off!

We don’t mean that they’re crazy
. '. . Holy cockeye, nothing like
that. We are speaking, at the pre-
sent moment, of Mr. Terrible Turk
and all his abomination, known to
thousands of admirers as The
Whistle.

To be frank, The Whistle Club—
or The Whistlers Club, or something
—has been formed.

Leo Stone (its conductor and chief
admirer), after years of threats, de-
clares (1) that the Whistlers club is
formally organized; (2) that its em-
blem, to be bestowed upon those who
have “made” the column three times,
will be a charm in the form of a
miniature whistle; (3) that there

will be, at one time or another, a
banquet for these wits of the cam-
pus.

Moreover, insists this prime jester
of harem fame, the Cap and Gown
will devote one complete section tn
pictures of the eminent contribs, to-
gether with the years leading con-
tributors. Recognition of our young-
est and wisest group by the Univer-
sity’s annual publication lends dig-
nity to the organization.

“Bigger and Better,” exclaims the
Turk, revealing his future policy.
“Henceforth the student body will
crash into the Daily Maroon office
to procure The Whistle, accompanied
by a free copy of The Daily Maroon.”
And his lithsome figure vanished,
murmuring something about “Louder
and f unnier.”

Federation Council Calls For
Cooperation with P. C. Dept

An attitude of criticism toward the
Medical Department and the Depart-
ment of Physical Culture, which has
existed on the campus for some time,
came to a climax at the beginning of
this quarter, when a focal point for
criticism was supplied in the suspen-
sion of students who had failed to
meet the requirements of the Depart-
ment of Physical Culture. The situa-
tion has caused numerous discussions
of the question, and the Federation of
University Women, after an extensive
survey among students, has the fol-
lowing suggestions to offer:

The relationship of the student to
the Department of Physical Culture is
well-defined, and is clearly stated dur-
ing one of the early meetings of each
class. The records are open to stu-
dents, who are specifically requested
to inspect them shortly before the

MIRROR STATES
SALE PROGRESS

Reports Most Good Bids
Gone; Friday to be Formal

Report of the ticket sales for the
First Annual Mirror to be held at
Mandel hall March 5 and 6 shows
that all the good seats are being sold
rapidly, according to Gertrude Brom-
berg, box office chairman. Good
seats for Friday are practically sold
out, although there are still some left
for the Saturday performance. Tic-
kets may be purchased at the box
office in Mandel cloister during the
office hours from 11 to 5 daily.

Opening night of Mirror will be
formal, following former traditions,
according to Alta Cundy, general
manager of Mirror.

Songs in the production will be
written by campus composers. A
nine-piece men’s orchestra will play
the accompaniment throughout the
show, while an eleven-piece women’s
orchestra will play the specialty
numbers.

The program as a whole is a con-
glomeration of numerous campus au-
thors’ manuscripts and will show the
University of Chicago’s type of wo-
man as she really is.

NEGRO SOCIOLOGIST
DISCUSSES “RACIAL
FACTORS OF WAR”

W. E. Burghard DuBois, famous
negro sociologist, will speak tonight
on “Racial Factors of War” at 8
o’clock in Harper M-ll under the au-
spices of the Liberal club, the Fellow-
ship of Youthful Peace, and the In-
terracial Discussion group. There will
be no admission charge and all those
interested will be welcome. This lec-
ture is part of the program of the “sec-
ond Annual Institute of Libt.al
Thought” which has been going on for
two weeks.

Mr. DuBois is one of the leading
negro thinkers of the country and is
also a legal authority on all racial
problems. He received his college ed-

Once again hurling its uncompro-

governing delegation’s actions, the
Undergraduate council yesterday re-
jected a recommendation of the
Board of Undergraduate Publica-
tions. that a reporter attend the
council’s meetings.

Will Be Present

A reporter from The Daily Maroon
will attend the meeting of the Un-
dergraduate council next Wednes-
day. If asked to leave, he will re-
fuse. The,reporter will remain un-

which he will write a complete ac-
count of the council’s actions for

Maroon.

No longer is it necessary to burn

ty libraries, and keep a comprehensive

At this Meeting the reporter will
neither speak nor take any action
against the Undergraduate council.
As a representative of the student
publication of the University, he will
present, in accordance with the
policy of that publication every-
thing that it is The Daily Maroon’s
privilege and duty to print.

Present* Recommendation

The recommendation adopted by
the Board of Undergraduate Publica-
tions at its last meeting was pre-
sented by Addison Wilson, who by
virtue of his chairmanship of that
body is a member of the council. The
recommendation reads as follows:

“While the Board of Undergradu-
ate Publications has no opinion to ex-
press on the question of undergradu-
ate council meetings, it recommends
that The Daily Maroon be repre-
sented at meetings of the Under-
graduate Council by an accredited
member of the senior staff, recogniz-
ing of course that there may be

accomplish this purpose, and sings “Il ,	,	,.	.	-	..

1	K	° I closed executive sessions for the dis-

Never Knew” instead of reciting An-
glo-Saxon poetry.

A professor of the University of
Southern California recently denounc-
ed co-eds for powdering their noses
in class and offered any man an “A”
grade if he would come to class and
shave during lectures. According to
the “Ubyssey” of the U. of British
Columbia, three men “called” him.
Armed with razors, soap and towels,
the trio appeared in next day’s class,

performed the operation, won
fessor’s compliments and an
the course.

Another professor gave a

the pro-
“A” in

difficult

final, announcing that anyone who
would sing before the class would be
excused from the examinations. After
seeing the questions, one demure little
co-ed took advantage of the offer.

Dorjahn to Speak
at Eta Sigma Phi

“The Development of Athenian
Democracy’ will be the subject of
a talk by Alfred P. Dorjahn, in-
structor in Greek, who will speak at
the meeting of Eta Sigma Phi today
at 4:30 in Classics 20. Mr. Dorjahn,
who came to the university at the
beginning of last quarter, is speak-
ing before the undergraduate class-
ical club for the first time.

Following the lecture, further try-
outs will be held for “Antigone,” a
Greek tragedy which will be given
under the auspices of Eta Sigma Phi
in the spring according to a time-
honored custom. Though the place
of presentation has not definitely
been decided upon it is probable
that it will be given on the lawn be-
hind iua Noyes hail.

cussion of personalities at which
time he will retire.”

Recites History

The turmoil over the question at
hand had its beginning at a meeting
of the Undergraduate council one
month ago, when, after a heated and
prolonged discussion, it was decided
by a nine to two vote that meetings
of the Undergraduate council should
take place behind closed doors, with
The Daily Maroon reporter on the
outside. Charles Anderson, presi-
dent of the governing body, and Al-
len Miller, president of the senior
class, opposed their fellow members
to no avail.

Flaying The Daily Maroon as a
“yellow, unreliable sheet, incapable
of presenting the truth comprehen-
sively and accurately,” the nine in-
disposed law-givers reviled this peri-
odical as a poor example of college
journalism. The women, ever fear-
ful of the powers of the press, were
most vociferous and merciless in
their attacks.

Is Unfortunate Conflict

A short time after this unfortun-
ate occurrence The Daily Maroon
saw fit to obtain a complete account
of the council’s proceedings by
“some other means,” as the Bible
says.

WE FULFILL AN OBLIGATION

'T'HE Undergraduate council is not a secret society. What it
does, or what it fails to do, is not the private business of its
members. Students elect the council; hence the council is respon-
sible to the students. Council meetings are the students’ business.

The Daily Maroon is he official newspaper of the students.
Therefore, The Daily Maroon undertakes to provide its readers
with complete news of the doings of the Undergraduate council.
Whatever difficulties it encounters, it proposes to surmount.

The meeting of the Undergraduate council next Wednesday,
and all subsequent meetings, will be covered by a reporter from
The Daily Maroon.

there was a very interesting discus-

offer but little light on this, Ander-

legians what a bunch of nice boys
we are. Some of the other delegates,
however, could not offer such happy
testimony, especially as regards what
is technically called drinking. Hea •-

went into extra evening sessions to
look into this problem, so intense
was the interest it aroused.

ANDERSON, delegate from Chicago to New Orleans, the Mid-
West Student Conference, and the Mardi Gras, is back. We
write this to welcome him.

To be sure, we have not seen him yet. We are purposely writ-
ing this before he appears. Afterwards, we might write other-
wise.

One of the great advantages of a student conference, attended
by delegates from many colleges scattered over a wide area, it is
broadening of the ideas of these delegates, and so of the colleges
they represent. One learns what ones neighbors, near and far,
have to deal with. Narrowness, provinciality, the local spirit—
all these disappear. One returns with a more general view, a con-
ception of things in their universal aspect.

Anderson, for example, had not been in New Orleans an hour
before he learned an important truth. Red flannels, he discovered,
are not to be worn in the South. Red flannels may be the thing
—they may even be just the thing—in Chicago; but in Louisiana
one doesn’t wear them. One wears/ rather, B. V. D’s. Anderson
comes back to Chicago with aTnew view of things. The old
formula:	.	\W>4^ . • .

. . Oct. 1—put them on:

. March 31—Take them off

he now finds to be but a local affair. Anderson (and his fellow-
students) have believed this law to be as universal as the laws
of the Medes and the Persians, and as unchanging as those of
gravitation and P. C. credit. Anderson now learns (and his fel-
low-students will learn from him) that red flannels, like every-
thing else, are relatives; that they depend upon time and place.
He gains a new understanding of the old verse

In one age, in one place, man does one thing; a thousand years I
later, a thousand miles away, man does something else. Nothing
is absolute; nothing is iron-clad, or flannel-clad. This is Ander-’
son’s lesson. At any rate, we trust so; we have not seen Anderson.!

WHO STARTED IT?

HAVE you a cold?

Do you sneeze? Do you cough? Do you breathe into the
face of the person who occupies the seat next to you in class? |
This is the season for colds (and a mighty good reason for colds
at that); and most people already have had or now have colds.
Mild colds or severe colds—they are colds; and mild colds or severs
colds—they are all contaminative.

We all recall that homely old adage about the bent penny that |
was passed first from a friend to a friend, then to an acquaintance,
then to a stranger, and so on, until everyone in Tarrytown had at
one time or other received the peculiar penny. And just so with
a cold. A friend or an acquaintance or a mere neighbor in a class-
room contracts a cold. He in turn passes it on to a third person,
who passes it on and on and on. And merely a bit of carelessness,
merely through a bit of heedlessness, many people are contamin-
ated with colds, many people are needlessly made to suffer.

Are you responsible for your neighbor’s cold?

When silvery
moonlight falls on town and
field—and the long, joyous
tour home is ready to begin
—have a Camel!

Camels contain the very choicest tobaccos grown in all the
world. Camels are blended by the world’s most expert
blenders. Nothing is too good for Camels. In the making
of this one brand we concentrate the tobacco knowledge and
skill of the largest organization of tobacco experts in the
world. No other cigarette made is like Camels. They are
the overwhelming choice of experienced smokers.

WHEN moonlight washes
woodland and hills with
platinum light. And the
tour home is ready to
begin—have a Camel!

For Camel makes
every smooth tour
smoother, adds of its
own contentment to
every delightful journey.
Camels never tire your
taste or leave a cigaretty
after-taste. Pay what
you will, you’ll never get
choicer tobaccos than
those in Camels.

So this night as the
forest-topped hills race
by in moonlit proces-
sional. As the magic
road curves through the
colonnades of birches—
have then the finest made,
regardless of price.

Have a Camel!

Our highest with, if you
do not yet know Camel
quality, it that you try
them. We invite you to
compare Camelt with
any cigarette made al
any price.

FOUR TEAMS ELIMINATED IN SEMI-FINAL

Natators Engage Boilermakers On Saturday

WILL BE SECOND
HOME MEH OF

PRESENT SEASON

Splashers Hope to Avenge
Past Defeats In

Own Tank

Coach McGillivray and his Maroon
natators will be “stay at home, play
at home” boys over this week-end.
Saturday evening at 8 o’clock they
will meet a highly respected group
of mermen from Lafayette, Indiana,
when Purdue brings her swim team
to Bartlett.

This Is to be the second home meet
for Chicago—Indiana being defeated
here in the initial contest of the
season. It is hoped that the jinx
which has been following the Ma-
roons on their way from home en-
counters will be broken when they
once more perform in their own
tank.

Ha* Good Team

Purdue, although defeated three
times in three engagements, has a
good team this year. This is evi-
denced by the small seven point mar-
gin by which the dangerous Illinois
team won from them.

Some new’ m^n have strengthened
the Boilermakers in several events,
Dithmer, Davenport, and Leichtle are
a trio of real stars. The former has
been making exceptionally good time
in the 100 and 40 yard events to win
with regularity. Davenport swims
a fast 440. Leichtle, an all around
man, is entered in almost every
event. He is good in all of them
and especialy so in the backstroke.

Captain Noyes will be the main-
stay of the Maroons. Together with
Harry Rittenhouse, yearling captain
last year, he will shoulder the hopes
for dash and relay victories. Dia-
mond and Nyhydal will again fight it
out for supremacy in the 200 yard
breastroke, and are expected to ac-
cumulate some points. Charley Lane
and Jerry Greenberg are other prob-
able point winners for the Maroons,
but will meet some stiff competition
from Darnell of Purdue, who also
is a fast splasher in their event.

Special Prep Event

As an added attraction for the
meet a special relay event for high
schools has been planned to fill in
between the swim contest and the
water polo game. It is to be a 240
yard event for six man teams.

VARSITY BASKETBALL
SQUAD SCRIMMAGES
WITH FROSH IN GYM

Norgren sent bis eagers through a
fast scrimmage with the freshmen last
night in an effort to bring the team
back to fighting form. The Maroons
were sadly off color against the Illini
last Saturday night and must show
much better shooting and guarding if
they expect to stop Iowa on Saturday.

Sam Barry’s Hawks have hit their
stride as is shown by the fact that
they held the high powered Purple
five to eleven points. Capt. McConnell
of the lowans is about the best guard
on the Big Ten and should cause the
Maroons forwards plenty of worry.

Norgren will rely on his usual line-
up to close the last away from home
game with a victory. Alyea is at the
pivot post, Sackett and Zimmerman
at the forwards, and Hocrger and Mc-
Donough fill the guard berths. Ear-
well and Marks will be given an op-
portunity to perform, since the tilt is
doped to be a close guarding game.

The Sob In Business

It has lately been the fashion among
the intellectuals to stand up for old
Rotary, old Lions Club, old Ki wants
and all those other organizations
which but a short time ago were sup-
posed to be the best fit to come in for
the covert sneer, being representative
as they were of the celebrated Great
American Spirit. It was not so long
ago that all those clubs, along with the
Spirit that moves through all things
American, were bywords and things
of derision. Not so any more. The
Y. M. C. A. secretaries, evangelists,
ami Sunday school teachers have got
in their work of education, and taught
us that after all, despite all the sneer-
ing of those on a higher plane, it is
Rotary that moves the world. So, just
as lately it was the fashion to sneer,
it is now the thing to bellow the old
Rotary songs, click knives on the lips
of glasses, and join in singing the
praises of the Rotary Spirit to the
highest heavens.

“The Sob In Business” concerned
itself with telling how to sneak inside
the good graces of your neighbor and
then sell him a bundle of shingles or
something else he didn’t want, or,
anyway, sock him for a row in some
way or other. "What gets you busi-
ness gentlemen?” demanded the mas-
ter brain making the talk. Then, like
a Fourth of July orator, he repeated
that poser—and as nobody said any-
thing ,he answered himself: “Good
will—good will gets it! And how do
you build good will, gentlemen? when
do you build it?” (Two more rhetori-
cal questions, I surmised). He then
seized hold of a large cardboard
which had been standing by all the
while, dramatically turned its business
side to his audience, and there.......
there was a life-size portrait of a
mewling Mellin’s Food Baby, tastily
done in black and white. “Then the
time to build good will, gentlemen.” I
heard through the mist which had sud-
denly closed about me, “then's the

By Victor Roterus

Like Tennyson’s brook there are
some things that go on forever. Un-
til last Saturday it was conceded that
the gym team’s string of victories was
included in that grouping. For years
Dan Hoffer’s lads had cut a monoton-
ous line of notches into the parallel
bars to symbolize their victories, but
during the past week-end they met
their Purdueloo.

Always Win

Coach Hoffer, to seek a balm after
this unforeseen calamity, unearthed
the past dear old records and sought
confidants. “Since 1916,” he declared
as the records began to have a sooth-
ing effect, “there has been but one
year in which we had an opportunity
to congratulate the winners. That was
in 1922 when Wisconsin and Min-
nesota forgot themselves and beat us.
Since then they have behaved as they
should.”

Feels Good To Lose

And then he went on to point out a
deluge of other achievements and they
were as numerous as Paavo Nurmi’s
world records. Besides clicking off the
conference championship each year as
regularly as the plaster falls .-ff from
the caving walls of Cobb hall the gym-
nasts have coralled two official na-
tional championships and two un-
official championships and two unof-
ficial country-wide titles. Several na-
tional individual champs have been
produced. In fact, championships
have been so common that Mr. Hof-
fer was inclined to remark, “It seems
good to lose once again.”

time.” 1 looked around: many of the
captains of industry were openly and
shamelessly choking back great sobs.
“Oh, Gawd,” I heard one of them
say, “from now on I’m going to live
a better life, as a lumber dealer I’m
going to give SERVICE to my fellow
man. Gawd, ain’t that a beautiful sen-
timent he put across?”

I frankly say that since that splurge
I am emphatically not “sold on” Ro-
tary and Big Brother Babbitt. The
“message” did not "get across” to me.
I am going to drag the old sneer for
the Great American Spirit out of the
mothballs once more and practice up
on it. And then, when the next oc-
casion offers, I am going to cut loose
from “the thing to do” and, forgetting
the pastor's words, indulge in a super-
Adolph Menjouish grimace at Babbitt
and Rotary both. And I call upon
all good men to do the same.

Maroons and Illinois
Tied in Relay Wins

Figures show that not so long
ago Chicago track teams were the
terror of the Conference. True,
Chicago has sent more men to the
Olympic games than any other
western university. And now the
records show that at the Illinois
relays, the Maroons and Illinois
are' tied with six apiece as the
leading relay winners. Most of
these six races were won in the
early years of the relay carnival.

This year it appears that the
Maroon have but a slim chance to
cop a relay, for the competition
is exceptionally keen. The Ma-
roon two mile relay team with
Jimmy Cusack have a good chance
to place and still retain their tie
with Gill’s team as the Illini do
not boast exceptionally strong
relay teams.

RUNNERS PREPARE

FOR ILLINI MEET

In spite of the fact that the track
team came out fourth in their last
meet, which happened to be a quad-
rangular one, they are journeying to
Champaign this week end with the
firm determination to stage a big
spurt and grab off one of the top
places. The downstate school is put-
ting on their ninth annual relay carni-
val Saturday and fifty universities all
of whom are sending their best, are
entered, but for several reasons local
fans have figured that the Maroon
colors will float high when the totals
are given out.

The first of the reasons is the fact
that the meet will consist almost en-
tirely of relay runs, eight in all of va-
rious distances and make-ups. Every-
one concedes that the strongest sec-
tion of the University team is our set
of relay runners. And the same peo-
ple are sure that they can wield just
as wicked a baton as any other aggre-
gation that will be present,—so they
forecast a great amassing of Chicago
points via that particular route.

The others of the reasons are us-
ually called Cusack and Burg. Last
year at the spring conference meet
Cusack stepped away to a neat first
in the mile run and there is no ap-
parent reason for his not doing the
same this year. And Burg has always
showed plenty of class in the high
jump and the pole vault and there is
no doubt at all but that he will figure
in those events down at Champaign.



SIGMA MJ, A. T. 0., DELTA SIGMA

PHI, PHI GAMMA DELTA WIN IN
INITIAL ROUND OF CAGE TOURNEY

Garden Scintillates as A. T. O. Downs Dekes in Speedy
Game; Large Crowd Enthusiastically
Cheers Favorite Squads

By Jack Welty

Showing the best floor work thus
far exhibited, coupled with some
close guarding, A. T. 0. defeated
the Dekes in the feature game of the
first round of the semi finals for the
University championship. The Delta
Sigs, Sigma Nu’s and Phi Gams also
won their games and thus won the
right to play in the next round of the
tourney.

Gordon Star*

Starting out by scoring a basket
in the first twenty seconds of play
Gordon of the A. T. O.’s quickly
put his team in the lead and con-
tinued to star at the scoring end.
He contributed seven field goals dur-
ing the encounter and also played a
stellar floor game. Anderson at the
other forward sunk four baskets
while Castle chalked up four to his
credit. Murphy played a nice de-
fensive game and his dribbling was
a feature. “Togo” Dygert was the
big man for the Dekes with his four
baskets all from midfloor. The
Deke guards seemed to have a great
deal of trouble stopping the fast
A. T. 0. forwards under the basket.

Phi Gamma Delta handily defeated
the Zeniths aided by the four baskets
of Grant who looks to be about the
best center in the tourney. Ralston
and Bartlett each made two field
goals and otherwise starred. Mc-
Carthy’s guarding bordered on the
sensational and he very rarely failed
to get the ball off the backboard and
start it down the floor. Gorden’s
two baskets from deep center was
also a feature of the game.

Macs Lose

Hoey was the outstanding man in
the Sigma Nu-Mac clash which the
former won by a score of 16 to 12.
The Sigma Nus had the upper hand
all during the battle due to some
pretty guarding by Brignal and

Price. Stevens was the high point
man for his team and Koerber
starred at the floor game. Ander-
son playing forward for the Macs
was the star of the losers and his
scoring kept them in the running
during the encounter.

Featured by the close guarding of
both aggregations Delta Sigma Phi
barely defeated Chi Psi by a close
decision of 10 to 7. Gray of the
Delta Sigs almost single handed won
the game for his team by scoring
three field goals, the only ones made.
The Chi Psis were held to one bas-
ket, made by Goble, by the close
guarding of the Delta Sigs. Drain
played a nice game and also con-
tributed four free throws.

TIE CAGE CONTEST

After a hotly contested battle, the
Freshman-Sophomore struggle ended
in a 24-24 tie in the women’s cage
tilt, yesterday. The outcome of the
game was in doubt every moment a,s
first one side and then the other took
the lead. The Freshman-Senior con-
test was a regular walkover for the
Seniors in which the Freshmen had no
chance at all from the beginning. It
ended in a score of 33 to 7.
