TWENTY TEAMS HOLD
SETTLEMENT PURSES

The end of the football season ap-
proaches, and with it the end of the
after-game teas that are a feature
of fraternity house activity during
these autumn days. Those mixers in
the Reynolds Club, that are the de-
light of the more uncouth campus ele-
ment, will also have their termination
with the Wisconsin game a week
from Saturday. Some may be in-
clined to lament the passing of these
things, so conducive to restoring that
tranquility of mind which has been
only too regularly jarred of late by
the doings on Stagg Field. But I,
in my utter simplicity of outlook, see
only in their going the beginning of
a great peace—a‘peace that will only
be married until next fall by such
casual sociable gatherings as the
mixers in the C. and A. building, at-
tendance at which is discretionary.

* * * *

Never a regular attendant at the
wholesome Saturday afternoon par-
ties in the Reynolds Club, I have
nevertheless lent my presence to vari-
ous teas through the fall season. At
these affairs my conduct has been
uniformly the same. After coming in
and laying away my coat, I elbow my
way through the seething smoke
towards the tables burdened with
cream cheese sandwiches, chocolate
and pecan cookies, pound cake and
coffee. When I get close to the more
or less groaning board, I lower my
head, bowl over all in my path, and
drive forward until I am within range
of the stack of plates. My next move
invariably is to gain possesion of one
of these plates, place upon it two
pickled ham sandwiches, two choco-
late and pecan cookies, one piece of
the pound cake (weighing, on the
average, three pounds) and a cup of
coffee. ,

* * * *

Then, holding by elbows in close,
lest I be jogged and the coffee spilt
upon the wallpaper, I stand on tip-
toes, protrude my chin, and look
things over. When I have caught
sight of an empty corner, I make for
it with a baffling change of pace,
shaking off tacklers with a throw of
my hips the while.

* * * *

But sometimes my plan of pro-
cedure does not work. Last Satur-
day, for instance, the crowd was
somewhat larger than usual, and
looking around for my quiet corner,
I found every one full. No such ex-
perience had ever befallen me be-
fore; I was nonplussed. I began to
wander aimlessly about. I was
jarred by a hard elbow to the ribs,
from some other seeker after food.
Knocked temporarily off balance, I
was postled from the other side, and
my coffee splashed over the rim of
the cup in a mighty tidal wave, ren-
dering the pound cake even more
weighty with the added moisture
picked up. A rush from the rear next
surprised me. It was only with the
utmost difficulty that I remained in
control of my two cookies, which be-
gan to skid for the edge of the plate
at the first moment of impact. But,
with an heroic effort, I restored the
right balance to my plate, and, hav-
ing seen the futility of trying to
withstand the mob, I made for the
kitchen, and ate in peace with only
the cat for company.

* * * ♦

When to all this turmoil is added
the necesity of appearing at ease and
conversing occasionally with the
guests, you can see the difficulty of
these tea businesses. A certain one
of the visitors with whom I stopped
for a moment last aSturday found me
rather unresponsive as a conversa-
tionalist, and pointed it out. Well,
what can you expect of a man after
he has been thrown for a loss ten
straight times on his attempted runs
to cover with a piece of measly pound
cake, gained only after the greatest
exertion in the first place,

Charity Drive Finance
Helpers Number 200

Twenty teams with ten men and
ten women as captains have been
chosen by Holmes Boynton and
Frances Kendall, co-chairmen on the
finance committee, to manage the
finances of the Settlement Night
campaign.

Each team consists of a captain
and ten members whose duty it is to
solicit money for the campaign.
These teams raise more than half of
the total money brought in by drive
and about ten per cent of the annual
budget of the settlement. The teams
are to work on a competitive basis
and those on the winning team are to
be the guests of the settlement at a
theater party. Any group of ten
wishing to participate may enter the
contest by reporting its membership
to Holmes Boynton at the Psi U
I house. The members and captains of
j the teams are listed below:

New Committee

Fosters Chicago
■Spirit On Campus

“More Chicago spirit”, is to be the
watchword on the campus from now
on. In conjunction with the move-
ment for more pep at the University,
a committee has been appointed by
the Interfraternity Council to act as
host to the visiting athletic teams.

This committee will meet all the
teams at the station, escort them to
their hotel, and help to get them lo-
cated on campus. Robert Massey has
been chosen as the head of this com-
mittee, with Jack Cusack and Jim
Flexner as his helpers.

This organization is the first work
which has resulted from the movement
to show the members of the other
schools some real Chicago spirit and
courtesy.

i’26 CLASS COUNCIL
POSTPONES MEETING

Monday afternoon is the new date
set for the Senior Class Council meet-
ing. According to reports it was to
have been held Friday at noon but
it has since been changed to Monday
afternoon at 2:30. The meeting is to
be held in Cobb 110.

The purpose of the meeting is to
make out the schedule of activities
for the ensuing year. The things of
most importance to be listed will be 1
the luncheons and parties which are j
being planned for the Seniors. I

Fresh Arabian News Mailed to

Campus Daily Via Umm al-Kurd

By Robert McCormack

What’s on in Arabia is better known
at the University than at any other
place in the United States. The Uni-
versity has gained this distinction by
being the only American subscriber to
Umm al-Kura, official gazette of the
government at Mecca.

Learning of the existence of the
paper from Viscount de Tarazi and
Ameen Rihani, nofed authorities on
the Orient, Martin A. Sprengling, pro-
fessor of Arabic languages and litera-
ture at the University, subscribed. The

Omit Pep Session

For Northwestern

No pep session is scheduled to-
night on the eve of the Northwest-
ern football game. However, next
Friday night there will be a pep
meeting held in Mandel hall to
cheer the players on for the last
game of the season with Wiscon-
sin.

Pledges of the various campus
clubs will be on hand to sell the
remainder of the “Go Chicago”
buttons which are to be worn at
the game. This campaign, which
ends at the close of the Wisconsin*
game, has been ably supervised
under the direction of Catherine
Fitzgerald.

MORTAR BOARDS
TOP PHOENIX LIST

Claire Davis Wins Individual
Sales Prize

Mortar Board was awarded first
place and a bonus of ten dollars in the
Phoenix sales campaign which was
held for the first time yesterday. Nine
saleswomen representing the club sold
265 copies.

Pi Delta Phi with eight saleswomen
sold 166 copies of the comic publica-
tion.

For individual sale of sixty-two
copies, Claire Davis, Chi Rho Sigma
was awarded a prize of five dollars.
Fannie Denton, Phi Upsilon, came
second by selling sixty copies.

Pep Meet Follows
Annual Celebration

Of “Chicago Night”

W. A. A. Chicago Night banquet
and pep meeting will be held tonight
at 6 in the main gymnasium of Ida
Noyes hall. Following the banquet
and the program, the guests will go
to the pep session before the North-
western game at Mandel hall.

Miss Gertrude Dudley, head of the
department of Physical Culture, and
Frances Lawton, president of W. A.
A., will be the principal speakers on
the program. Mrs. K. A. Graham of
the English department will speak on
“Athletic Women in Literature.”
Beatrice Nesbit has been appointed
toastmistress for the evening. Cheers
will be led by Aline Grossman.

Settlement Vodvil

Tryouts Next Week

Tryouts for Settlement night
vaudeville are Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday afternoons at 3:30 in
Mandel hall. The vaudeville will be
presented Saturday, Dec. 4 in Mandel
hall.

An idea of each act must be pre-
sented at these tryouts to the co-
chairmen

name of the paper means “The Mother
of Towns,” he explained yesterday.

This paper is the official mouthpiece
of the newly organized government of
Ibn Saud. The news consists largely
of his decrees and his doings. During
the last Pilgrimage, he made a road
across Arabia passable for automobiles
so that his aged father, too old to
travel by camel, could make the trip
to Mecca.

Illini Pressmen

Hosts To College
Editors Nov. 18

University publications will be rep-
resented at the second annual meet-
ing of the National Press Congress,
November 18-20, at Champaign, by
Managing Editor Walter G. William-
son of The Daily Maroon, Business
Manager William Stephenson of the
Phoenix, and Managing Editor Rich-
ard Scholz and Business Manager
Dermott McGraw of the Cap and
Gown.

Five hundred- invitations to par-
ticipate in the meeting have been sent
to student editors and business man-
agers representing colleges of every
state. Staff heads of all regularly
organized student publications are
eligible to membership in the Con-
gress. Problems confronting student
publications will be discussed at this
meeting and queries will be answered
by specialists in college journalism
work. A round table discussion will
be conducted for the purpose of mer-
itorious discussion.

The Illinois-Ohio football game to
be held at Champaign during that
week-end will climax the social pro-
gram being arranged for the occasion.
A. F. Priebe is president of the Con-
gress.

Seniors Equipped
With Canes But
Not With Gloves

Eastern technique in the use of the
cane has not as yet penetrated the
west if conclusions are to be drawn
from yesterday’s exhibition on cam-
pus.

If the Seniors who are using the
canes were judged by the Easterners
of the “old school” they might be in-
clined to scoff at those who lack the
gloves, wear sheepskins, and go hat-
less, things considered most necessary
articles connected with carrying a
cane.

EMILIO DE GOGORZA

GIVES PROGRAM IN

SOUTH SIDE SERIES

Emilio de Gogorza, reputed as the
‘finest baritone of our generation,”
will be soloist on the third program
included in the series of five by the
South Side Concert Course, which
will be held tonight at the Midway
Masonic Temple, 6115 Cottage Grove
Avenue.

Two more concerts will be given
in this series, one by Gita Gradova,
pianist on Friday, No:v. 26, and the
final program by Anna Case, concert
soprano, on Friday, Dec. 3. Tickets
for these concerts may be purchased
at the door for $2.20.

NEED FORTY WOMEN!

At least forty women will be need-
ed to sell balloons at the Wisconsin
game, Saturday, November 20. Those
interested have been requested to
sign up on the poster in Ida Noyes
hall or see Ellen Hartman, chairman
of the sales force, before Tuesday.
Captains for the teams will be chosen
after the women have signed up and
will be announced later. Proceeds
from the sale will go toward the Set-
tlement Drive fund.

Marshals, Aides Meet

All the marshals and aides in the
University will be expected at the
President’s office on Monday after-
noon at 3:30, to complete arrange-
ments to greet Queen Marie. Cap
and gowns should be worn, and these
may be secured at any time at the
Building and Grounds office in the
Press Building.

INAUGURATE MARCHING
“C" AT ANNUAL FORMAL

Ohio Elects Cow
Homecoming Queen

Ohio State has elected a unique
“Homecoming Queen.”

When the alumni returned Sat-
urday for the game with Michi-
gan, Ohio Maudine Ormisby, thor-
oughbred Holstein cow, will act as
sovereign. On a ticket with ten
popular Ohio State University
women Maudine was nominated.
The election proved an over-
whelming victory for the heifer
whose vote exceeded the total cast
for the other candidates. Stu-
dents received this novel idea with
enthusiasm.

LEE NEW FRIARS
PRESS MANAGER

First Appointment Made For
Staff of 1927 Show

Deemer Lee has been selected as
press manager for this year’s Black-
friar production. He was the first
member of the Blackfriar staff to be
chosen. Lee has been a member of
The Daily Maroon staff for three
years and is campus representative
of the Chicago Daily Tribune. He
was publicity manager of the Home-
coming campaign.

The remainder of the staff will be
announced on November 23, accord-
ing to Phil Watrous, Abbot of the Or-
der.

Chicago W. A. A.

Gives Luncheon for
Wisconsin Chapter

Members of the Wisconsin W. A.
A. will be guests of the University
W. A. A. at the luncheon Saturday,
Nov. 20 at 12 in the sun parlors of
Ida Noyes hall. The affair precedes
the game annually.

All women of the campus have
been invited, and may secure tickets
for sixty cents from Margaret Nel-
son, Mona Flanders, Carol Hess, Hel-
en Walters or Eleanor Wilkins. Fresh-
man women who wish to earn W. A.
A. points have been asked to report
to Margaret Nelson.

OPERA OFFERS LOW

RATES TO STUDENTS

Reduced rates for the Chicago Civic
Opera company’s Sunday afternoon
performances will be given to Uni-
versity students if seventy-five apply,
according to a notice from the execu-
tives of the company. The first per-
formance will be “Carmen” with Mary
Garden, Stramd Asseau, and Giamoco
Rimini, while Oukrainsky, Nemeroff,
Shermont, Samuels, and Chapman
will be in the ballet.

Ph. D. Holders Believed Not to
Be Scholars—Professor Jemegatt

A questionnaire attempting to as-
certain why the holders of higher de-
grees from universities fail to be-
come scholars has been sent to all
holding the degree of Doctor of Phil-
osophy throughout the country by a
committee acting under Prof. Marcus
W. Jernegan of the University.

The work of investigation is being
carried on through the American
Historical Association, of which Prof.
Jernegan is an active member. The
survey will embrace schools, colleges

and universities all over the country.
It gained its initial impetus when the
question of why graduate work in
history led to so little productive re-
search on the part of holders of the
Ph.D. degree was brought up at one
of the association meetings.

Ten questions covering economic,
social and moral factors entering into
the question are included in the ques-
tionnaire, a progress report on which
will be made Nov. 29 and 30 to the
council of the association at its meet-
ing in New York.

Interfraternity Officers
Lead Grand March

A “Marching C” will be inaugur-
ated at the Inter-fraternity Ball with
President and Mrs. Mason walking
between the points of the giant letter
which will be led by the officers of
the Interfraternity Council, James
Cusack, Wiliam Harrington, Tom
Paul, and William Cuthbertson,, with
their partners.

This is the first time in the history
of the Interfraternity Ball, which is
to be held November 24 at the Shore-
land Hotel, that there has been a
grand march, and officers of the
Northwestern Interfraternity Council
have been invited to witness it.

Accept Eligibility Plan

Among other matters undertaken
by the council was the accepting of
the new eligibility plan for frater-
nities proposed by Dean Boucher.
Under the new plan two groups with-
in the fraternity, one made up of the
actives and the other of both actives
and pledges, will have to maintain an
average of “C” in order to have the
rights of initiating and social privl
ileges. This plan puts more of the
burden of keeping up the house aver-
age upon the active members.

“I am glad to have this opportun-
ity to express my appreciation of the
fine spirit of cooperation which the
fraternities have shown in their re-
lations with the Dean of the Colleges
during the past year,” stated Dean
Boucher when he was notifiea of the
adoption of the measure.

T. S. O. Reinstated

Tau Sigma Omecron was rein-
stated into good standing with the
provision that they pay their back
dues and in the future cooperate more
generously with the Council.

Another decision reached by the
council was to send a delegate to the
meeting of the National Interfrater-
nity council which will be held in the
near future at New York Sity.

RED CROSS STUDENT
MEMBERSHIP DRIVE

STILL BELOW QUOTA

Red Cross membership drive at the
University in its second day has not
reached the quota set by former
years. Previously about $100 has
been collected in Ida Noyes hall alone.
Up to date the total amount received
reaches the thirty dollar mark. Stu-
dents may become members for one
dollar at the desk in the foyer of
Ida Noyes hall.

Hold Mirror Ballet

Try-Outs on Tuesday

Preliminary tryouts for the ballet
of the Second Annual Mirror will be
held Tuesday at 3:30 in the lower
gymnasium of Ida Noyes hal. All
women who have had any sort of
dramatic experience have been urg-
ed to attend. Freshmen as well as
upperclassmen are eligible.

The members of the royal family of
Herjaz are constantly traveling about
Arabia. They go by automobile and
keep in touch with each other by tele-

The paper which has just reached
the University also contains an ac-
count of the recent trouble between
Hedjaz and Turkey over the Mosul.
The arrival of a new Turkish counsel
and a quarrel between some Arabian

nobles over their utterances about
each other are also discussed. An ac-
cident which befell the deposed king,
namely the absconding ot his secre-
tary with two hundred and fifty
pounds in gold, is written about at
length.

A large section of the paper is taken
by a decree of Ibn Saud. This decree
deals with citizenship and naturaliza-
tion. The regulations of Hedjaz are
similar to those of the United States,
but there are several novel exceptions.

the fantastic that happened to be in style.

But who attends the mixers these days? We don’t, the Cap
and Gown staff doesn’t, the Phoenix staff doesn’t, the Intramuarl
staff doesn’t,—all of the best people, in fact, hie themselves to
fraternity teas, moving picture establishments, or crap games, and
the mixers are left in the lurch. Not only that: one of the boys
around the office tells us that he blew into the last post-football
scramble and found it a veritable melting pot, with woiking goils
from Fifty-fifth and Sixty-third streets doing most of the melting.

What, and when, are we coming to? University mixers are
for University men and women. Something, in. the words of Al

THE BIG SPLITS

THREE of the country’s oldest and best universities, institutions that
are supposed contain the very essence of our national culture,
schools that boast famous names on their very long alumni rosters,
are indulging in an unseemly squabble. And as usual, the cause is
athletics.

It seems that Harvard and Princeton are in the habit of playing
various games with one another, among others, football. And to
celebrate the annual football contest between the two school “The
Harvard Lampoon,” which seems to be a sort of sophomoric comic
sheet published up at Cambridge, made a few remarks about the
New Jersey college whose charter was originally signed by a reigning
king.

And Princeton, remembering the charter, the names on the
alumni roster, and its one-time president who was also President
of the United States, resented these remarks. Whereupon telegrams
and letters passed between the two schools. Princeton wanted to
know what the idea was, anyway; and then, not getting enough satis-
faction, she "severed athletic relations” with Harvard, which means
that the boys from Cambridge won’t play with the boys from New
Jersey any more.

Even President Lowell, the pontifice who surveys the world
from the top of the pile at Cambridge, was involved in the mess.
He apologized on behalf of the editors of the comic sheet. This
means that the case was a very serious one, because rarely does a
comic monthly of any sort penetrate a college president’s sanctum.

There’s really but one refreshing thing about the case. The
editors of the Lampoon didn’t have to apoligize. The Harvard
authorities refused to make them apologise, and everyone knows that
a mere college editor is easily sacrificed on the altar of the great
God, Football.

Well, some day people, at least those connected with colleges,
will be a little more intelligent.

Ten Years of Hard Work Between Campus and Stage Glory

Llewellyn Jones Discusses Realism,
Would-Be-Poets, Coffee and Books

Two Poems

THE MEDICAL BUILDINGS	CLOAK OF POEMS

Bq Lucille Prue-Benedict

Llewellyn Jones spiked his cigar on
one of the numerous spindles which
bristled from the d^sk like the spears
of a Liliputian army, and growled,
“As a literary editor and an instruc-
tor. speaking generally, I deny every-
thing emphatically.”

An office-boy interrupted our con-
versation by throwing a bundle of
books on the editor’s lap. “Ixiok at
this," Mr. Jones remarked as he held
up a two volume set on the life of
some statesman. “Don’t you feel
sorry for the poor reviewer that will
have to wade through it?”

Though we protested that we had
not asked his hobbies he said: “You
should have every good interviewer
ask that question. My hobbies are,
criticizing the efforts of my friends
to write poetry, explaining the mech-
anism of the universe to my son, and
making coffee.”

“FIRST IMPRESSIONS”

“Tell us something about your book,
‘First Impressions’.”

“Once I was offered a job as ex-
tension lecturer for Indiana Univer-
sity, and the gentleman in charge of

“Fooled In India”

—Professor Says

—-

It was just a tiny corner of India,
yet was characteristic of her people
throughout the whole country. Long
moonlit nights, heavy, fragrant air,
land of mystery—all those things
that one naturally associates with In-
dia, but the amusing incident is con-
nected with the ignorance of the na-
tives, rather than those associations.

This is the view of Dr. Horace G.
Wyatt, of the psychological depart-
ment in the University of Oregon,
who was for twenty years a resident
of India and during that time in-
spector of schools. It was his duty
as inspector to see that every school
kept a garden, however small. For
months he had floated down the
slowly moving river on his little raft,
stopping at every village, and pass-
ing inspection. He marvelled at the
thriving gardens which he saw and
was proud of the Inspiration he had
given his people. But the day came
when he pulled up a plant and found
that it had no root; several others re-
vealed the same thing and after much
effort he discovered, that whenever
the inspector was due the Indians
would transplant the plants from
some nearby place to look like a gar-
den.

So India still remains to Dr. Wyatt,
a land of beauty, mystery and ignor-
ant people.

OFF THE SHELF

reads for character to gain and everything to lose by

To one who
development and not merely for a
breathless or “snappy” story “Mar-
tha and Mary” by J. Anker Larsen
should prove interesting and valu-
able.

The author portrays two scarcely
dissimilar characters and tries al-
most in vain to depict differences in
their personalities. But he does this
in a sensitively understanding way
which few men can master, since it
seems their weakness, or is it their
virtue, to <}epict only strong char-
acters. Larsen, however is not sen-
timental nor emotional. A sugges-
tion of Nordic temperament and
style seems to pervade the entire
book.

“THREE STUDENTS”

“The Three Students,” by Haldane
MacFall, is a story of life in Persia
°f long ago, as seen through the lives
of a scholar’s two. The setting is in
dreamy, yet sinister, Persia; the
speech and dress are characteristic
of the time. MacFall flavors his en-
tire story with bits of philosophy
characteristic of the Mohammedan
religion. Through the characters,
Hassan Sabbah, Aboo Ali, and Omar
Khayyam, the author tells interest-
ing things about that religion and
introduces much practical sentimen-
tality. The entire-book tends toward
an ancient moral: “There is nothing

such affairs asked me my qualifica-
tions. ‘None,’ said I. ‘What else?’,
asked he. I have just finished ‘First
Impressions.’ ‘Who published it?’
‘Alfred A. Knopf.’ ‘Is he a* Chicago
man?’ Then and there my literary
aspirations breathed their last.”

A poet, a reviewer, and a photog-
rapher entered and were dispatched.
The telephone rang, and another
batch of books slid in the door. The
printer demanded some reviews. The
office boy brought in a sheaf of let-
ters. (Mr. Jones is a busy man.)

HIS VIEWS ON REALISM

“What do you think of the modern
trend of realism?”

“There are so many levels of real-
ism that it doesn’t mean much. The
piling up of detail in Dreiser, for ex-
ample would be called realism by
some people, but done carelessly or
for the detail’s sake as it seems to
lie with him, it is merely boring.
While analytical psychology may be
used rather crudely as by May Sin-
clair in the “Romantic” it is used less
crudely in her “Life and Death of
Harriet Grean.”

Employ Mice In
Cancer Research

“Mice are playing a very important
part in the solution of the cancer
problem,” said Miss Maude Slye, who
has been doing research work with
rats in her laboratory on Drexel ave-
nue.

“No single disease, perhaps, has re-
ceived more intensive study than can-
cer, and in none have the results
of diverse researches been more dif-
ficult of unification into an unassail-
able theory of etiology,” Miss Slye
added. The causes and the cure for
cancer have for years been topics of
international concern, and it is in the
furtherance of this cause that Miss
Slye is engaged in laboratory re-
search on mice.

“The hereditary studies in this
laboratory are the only extensive
ones made with spontaneous animal
cancer,” Miss Slye continues. “Most
other studies have been made with
experimentally produced tumors. But
whatever the type or method of de-
velopment of these experiemntal tum-
ors they have all followed the laws of
heredity in their concurrence when
any sort of extended test has been
made, even inadvertently, by the ex-
perimentor.”

dishonesty.

The “Three Students” is not the
sort of book which would appeal to
the reader in search of very mod-
ern, equally light reading, fiction.
One must go slowly through Mac-
Fall’s work for the language is far
more interesting than the plot itself.
The book ends with the dying of
Omar, who as he sips his last cup of
wine to the dregs, cries: “My sing-
ing’s done. The cup is empty. I
have drained the wine of life to the
lee.”

“LABELS”

A. Hamilton Gibbs again proves
his ability as a novelist of wide vi-
sion and brilliant insight in his sec-
ond novel, “Labels,” which is one
of the list of “best sellers.” Like
“Soundings,” his first novel, the title
gives no inkling of the text of the
story. It is a post-war novel, but
unlike most of them the sex element
is practically lacking. Thoroughly
British, it still gives a perfect picture
of the inability of the young people
who “Went through it,” to come
back and understand the petty prej-
udices of their parents.

The author has created characters,
live, real and all influenced by this
new unrest, or freedom from res-
traint, the aftermath of the war.

By Jan.qu.il Stevens «

The great grey stones go leaping up
to God

In all-sufficing beauty as they rise.
The towered turrets meet the skies
In majesty.. But not for wondrous
awe

Was this, Thy temple, built; rather
to keep the law

Of utter selflessness to all mankind,
To battle Death and give light to the
blind

And ease to pain; as in the ageless
days

The great Physician went His ways.

So may the House be built by Thee

To keep the law—“Ye do it unto Me!”

Statistics Show That Students In

Activities Lead In Academic Rating

Undergraduate students in campus
activities at the University have a
higher scholastic average than the
general University grade, according
to statistics.

A representative group of seventy-
four men and women who are prom-
inent on campus because of their par-
ticipation and leadership in every
branch of activities had an average
for all academic work done in the
University, of 3.376 which amounts
to slightly over a grade of B—,
whereas a grade of C is generaly
considered as average. No one on
the list of prominent men and wom-
en had less than a C average in ac-
cordance with the eligibility rulings.
The fraternity rating which includes
the grades of the majority of men on
campus, of which only a small per-
cent are interested in campus leader-
ship, is 2.803.

For the two quarters during which
upper classmen carry on the greatest
amount of extra-curricular activity,
the average was 3.295, less than one
tenth of a grade point below the
general average.

Women Head Men

Statistics on University grades
also prove the theory that women
lead the men in scholastic standing,
which fact has been reported true at
Northwestern and other co-educa-
tional institutions. Of the seventy- j
four students under consideration,
the thirty women had an average
grade of 3.677, while the forty-four
men averaged 3.075. Phi Beta Kappa
membership was awarded to seven
women of this same group and to
five out of the forty-four men.

As for the relative ratings of par-
ticipants in different activities, those
who work on University publications
stand highest with an average of
3.397. Of these, the Phoenix staff
leads in scholastic standing, with the
Daily Maroon and The Cap and

BREAK RECORD IN
FIRE PREVENTION

“Fires in the University? Well, we
may have them in waste baskets, but
our janitors and watchmen are al-
ways on the alert to prevent damag-
ing conflagration,” said Mr. L. R.
Fluke, superintendent of the depart-
ment of Buildings and Grounds, when
asked how the University prevented
fires.

There had been only one fire in the
University in the last year. That
was when a window burned in Ryer-
son and entailed a loss of fifty dol-
lars. Six years ago there was a big-
ger loss in the fire in the Power plant,
which amounted to $2500.

“I have one more thing to say in
connection with fires, and that is my
only lament,” Mr. Fluke continued.
The students used to ridicule our old
smoke stack at The Press building and
now that we have a brand new one
up, they don’t even know that it’s
there. These students!”

Dearest, I have woven you a lovely
cloak of poems;

Sad poems and happy ones, crim-
son poems and gray.

Dearest, will you take the cloak and
wrap it ’round you tight,

Thus to make you beautiful, and
me a little gay?

Oh, so you will scorn it? Well, I do
not care.

Dearest, never think that your
laughter gives me pain—

I shall gather up my cloak if you
throw it from you,

Tear it all to pieces, and use the
poems again!

Gown following in second and thi^d
places, respectively.

DRAMATISTS SECOND

The campus dramatists follow
the members of publication staffs with
an average of 3.320, while the presi-
dents of the various dramatic organ-
izations averaged slightly over B—.
The members of Gargoyles took first
place among the dramatic clubs while
the Tower Players ran second, and
members of Mirror third.

The members of athletic teams
came last in the ranking of these
three major types of activities. Their
average was high enough, however, to
surprise many who believe that good
athletes make poor students.

President High

The presidents and chairmen of
the eleven outstanding University or-
ganizations, the Undergraduate
Council, Y. M. C. A., Blackfriars,
Daily Maroon, Interfraternity Coun-
cil, Y. W. C. A., Federation, W. A.
A., Mirror, Senior Class and Junior
class councils, maintain an average
of 3.513 which is above the general
average of all campus leaders.

Statistics also show the correlation
between academic and extra curricu-
lar work. The majority of members
on editorial staffs are majoring in
English while the business managers
usually come from the C. .and A.
school.

On the Boards

Experiment in the theater was re-
newed again Wednesday night when
“The Game of Love and Death” by
Romain Roland was made known in
the Goodman Memorial Theater. The
experiment in the unity of time and
place resulted in long speeches built
around a feeble and impassioned do-
ihestic triangle. Monotony and over-
tragedy are the foremost of Mr. Ro-

land’s experimental whims.

“The Game of Love and Death" is
one of four completed pieces in a con-
templated cycle of twelve, which use
the French Revolution as a back-
ground. Theater three "panels” al-
ready completed are: “ Danton”,
“Wolves” and “The Fourteenth of
July”. The treatment of the psycho-
logical effect of the Revolution on its
citizens is unquestionably the most
notable feature of the piece. The
acting is fair, with Jack Daniels’
presentation of Valee as the most out-
standing. He carries the extremely
heavy part beyonu expectations and
does much to make it presentable for
the modern theater-goer.

Roland’s introduction of music is
pleasantly accomplished for he is a
sound and sane student of that art.
The part that light peasant music
played placed the play on a more solid
foundation of realism and relieved the
heaviness of the plot.

“Chicago Campus

Is No Place For
Freshman” — Mast

“The University of Chicago is no
place for a freshman,” said “Wallie”
Mast, hesitatingly ,but smilingly.
“Wallie” is ex-president of the As-
sociated Students at Colorado Col-
lege ,and graduate student in the
Divinity school here.

“I’ve come to this conclusion after
four years spent in a small school
and a year here . Why, the person-
ality of a freshman is absolutely ex-
tinguished here,” he said. “Instead of
welcoming a freshman, he is made
to feel that he is in the way. He
has to edge his way into things. He
is made to feel like an intruder.”

Wallie comes from a school where
it is considered a discourtesy to pass
a freshman without a cordial “Hi.”

“An entering student is actually
snubbed here. In order to get into
the swing of things he has to sacri-
fice his individuality and conform to
the standards set by his upperclass-
men. And fathers send their sons to
college for the development of char-
acter.” Wallie can get serious when
he wants to. And he semed to want
to.

Mencken Restates

Political Attacks

Twenty years ago the “Bad Boy
of Baltimore” was engaged in a
lengthy and fierce wordy battle with
the Methodist Divines of that city.
The Devil coming to his aid, he
emerged from the fray victorious and
with the added reputation of being
the foremost polemical writer of his
time. This reputation he has added
to and maintained until he is now
without a peer in the polemical field.
Today the man, H. L. Mencken, is
perhaps the most picturesque and
most hated man in the United States.
He is fierce and uncompromising in
all his attacks, and it is indeed a curi-
ous note that he has done more to re-
vitalize American literature than all
the studious harangues of More,
Brownell, and the late Professor
Sherman.

The latest Mencken book “Notes
on Democracy,” is as vigorous and
devastating an attack on American
Democracy as anything he has ever
written. It is fierce and it is terrific.
Mencken in this book holds back
nothing. He lets out all his keen
intellectual disgust of democracy in
one full blast. To the Mencken de-
votee the book is enjoyable, and to
the Mencken foe it is only another
indication of the man’s grouchy and
ailing nature.

SOCIALL Y SPEAKING

The week-end comes round again
and with a sigh of relief the campus
turns to the business of forgetting
that classes and mid-terms are part
of a college education. Achoth starts
early by entertaining the pledges of
the clubs and fraternities at a tea
dance Friday afternoon. W. A. A.
is giving a dance at Ida Noyes in
the evening.

The Friday night dating begins,
with a Deltho informal for their
pledges at the College Club and a
Delta Upsilon house dance as cam-
pus events. The Drake will probably
draw its usual crowd of campus
elite and the other places of amuse-
ment will get what is left.

D. U. Tea Dance

Nothing daunted by the fact that
the game is at Evanston Saturday,
the D. U.’s are having a tea dance in
the afternoon and the Tau Delta
Phi’s are having a house dance in
the evening.

Northwestern seems bent on show-
ing that it can entertain as well as
play football and advance notices
indicate an excellent day. The Al-
pha Phi’s have invited the frater-
nities and clubs to a football tea
dance after the game and most of
the fraternities are providing some
sort of entertainment for their visit-
ing brothers. The evening promises
to be equally good with the North
Shore hotels and country clubs get-

Actress Says

College Drama

Is of No Value

By Roselle F. Moss

“After college comes at least ten
years of hard work in stock com-
panies before success can be achiev-
ed before the footlights.”

Mrs. Samuel Insull, Chicago social
leader and producer-star of “The
Runaway Road” does not believe
that college dramatics prepare one
for the professional stage. “Dramatic
schools and amateur acting are only
a beginning,” she said. “The person
must learn how to use his voice and
his body and it is only through ex-
perience that he can gain this knowl-
edge.”

Intelligence Important

“Brains are one of the main req- -
uisites for an actor although the
American stage recognizes beauty
and personality.” The little woman
became interested. “You know,” she
went on to say, “the French make
it far more difficult for one to be-
come artistically great, but once ac-
claimed by the public one is always
appreciated. In the state’s beauty is
lauded for possibly a period of two
years and then is forgotten.”

Acting is of interest to Mrs. In-
sull because she feels that the actor
is the creative artist. “A good actress
is as much the creator as is the sculp-
tor or the painter,” she continued,
“for she is creating a new person.
One must oe capable of subjugating
herself to the role she is playing.”

School For Scandal

“My choice of play?” she ques-
tioned. “Because I had played the
role of Lady Teazle in “The School
for Scandal” I desired something
modern and therefore chose “The
Runaway Road.’ For my next char-
acter I have selected the role of a
vampire in order to illustrate more
plainly how one must change herself
in acting before the public.”

ent in the democratic state. Having
given his opinion of democracy
Mencken makes the statement that
there may not be any remedy for
democracy, or as he puts it, “Such
a system, for all I know, may lie
outside the farthest soarings of the
human mind, though that mind can
weigh the stars and know God. Until
the end of the chapter the ants and
bees may flutter their sardonic an-
tennae at us in that department—
the last joke upon man may be that
he never learned how to govern
himself in a rational and competent
manner.”

ting most of the Chicago crowd.

Sunday afternoon a Sigma tea and
one given by the Graduate C. & A.
Club conclude the festivities for this
week-end.

AWAKENING

By George Lee Gruskin

There was a park I played in when
a child—

A lovely place, with tiny lakes,
And trees that twined with twisting
vines run wild

Across the bark like sinewed
snakes.

Amongst this loveliness 1 sojourned
long—feeling nought,—

Until, one day, a friend remarked
in passing by,

“What ivonder-work hath Nature
wrought!”

Leaving me jealous that the beauty
was by others sought;

And since, that park has been a
source of constant pleasure to
my eye.

So, too, I knew you long—as but a
pleasant friend—

When, once I heard another praise
the fairness of your face,

And in a trice there were no other
thoughts could dare transcend
My thoughts of you—or even hope
to take their place.

Big Ten Gridder

About 14,000 Maroon football fans
will gather in Evanston tomorrow to
witness the dedication of the new
Dyche stadium and the annual battle
between Chicago and Northwestern.
That number of tickets has been sold
by the University ticket office and a
large block of the 50,00 Oseats will be
filled with Chicago’s “rooters.” The
last Maroon journey to Evanston was
in 1918.

The dedication of the stadium at a
time when the Purple team is mak-
ing such a strong bid for the Big Ten
championship is fortunate for them.
Elaborate ceremonies have been
planned for the event and a number
of local celebrities have signified in-
tentions of being on hand.

A new idea in stadium construc-
tion, the curved stand, was the basis
for the construction of the new bowl.
The curved stand, it is claimed, gives
the ma^mum amount of seats be-
tween the goal posts with the great-
est possible number on the fifty yard
line, and since all of the seats are
curved inwards all of the spectators
are faced towards the center of the
field where most of the actual play
takes place.

By Bill Weddell

An affair which is at once “all wet”
and yet a success is the latest offer
of the Intramural department. The
particular event in question is the
third annual Swimming Carnival
which will take place in the Bartlett
gymnasium pool on December 2nd
and third.

The meet, which according to “Doc”
Molander, Intramural advisor, will
be staged on an elaborate scale even
surpassing that of last year, will cul-
minate the activities of the Intra-
mural department for the quarter
and will provide a fitting climax to a
season replete with athletic thrills.

Many Feature*

Ralph McCormick, undergraduate
manager of the carnival, announced
today that in adition to the regular
swimming events there will be a re-
lay race between the city high schools
for the Chicago championship, a nov-
elty duck catching contest, and an
exhibtion by Johnny Weismuller,
world’s champion swimmer.

Harvard-Princeton Break In Big
Three Follows Long Controversy

The Big Three, for several decades
the standard of athletics and a tra-
dition made firm by means of the im-
petus which football gave it, was rent
asunder when Princeton severed all
relations with its ancient enemy,
Harvard, at a meeting of the board
<»f athletic control Wednesday. This
diplomatic break was brewing for
several seasons, previously having re-
sulted in temporary disruptions. The
culmination of this perrenial contro-
versy was brought about because of
Princeton’s taking offense at a slur
cast upon them by the Harvard Lam-
poon, a monthly periodical of that
instituion. The Lampoon intimated
that the undergraduate body was long
since in favor of dropping Princeton
from their schedule. Princeton has
been also made the butt of many cam-
pus quips.

The break, the fourth between the
universities, similar occurences being
in 1885 and in 1890, when mutual

charges of professionalism incited
both schools to enmity. In 1897 un-
necessary roughness was another
cause for a break. They resumed re-
lations in 1910 and have played every
year since except for the two war
years.

There have been numerous and
various reactions to this infraction.
The undergraduate body at Harvard
were pleased at the turn of events
and were of the opinion that the ex-
isting situation between the two col-
leges was impossible, while the offi-
cials of Harvard claim surprise. Yale,
the third member of the triumvirate
looks upon the incident as a tragedy.
Last fall after all hope seemed to
be despaired, it was Yale who stepped
in and healed the breach.

Thus is ended what was perhaps
the greatest of early athletic alli-
ances. Since 1877 these ancient riv-
als have drawn the eye of the foot-
ball world in their historic combats.

Northwestern is looking forward to
killing a couple of birds with one rock
when they will bump heads with the-
Maroon gridders in the new Dyche
stadium at Evanston tomorrow after-
noon.

In the first place the Purple expects
to retain its perfect record after the
session is over, and thus remain in
line for the conference championship.
In the second place the school on the
north shore, and nearly every else, pro-
foundly believes that the Northwestern
football team is, after ten year of bit-
ter disappointment, about to register a
win over the Maroons, and a lopsided
one at that, which Vill go a long way
in atoning for past grievances.

Strong Defense Needed

Although it seems that a Purple vic-
tory is inevitable, it is doubtful if
Northwestern, ‘even with backfield
inert like Baker, Gustafson and Lewis,
who was supposed to be ineligible this
year, can do more damage than
Zuppke’s mules. And if the Maroons
are to come anywhere near winning
they must put forward thqir best de-
fensive front, for the offensive strength
of Stagg’s men is well-kn’own.

Stagg, himself, is aware of the fact
that his team has not performed as
they should on the attack. Conse-
quently the Maroons will go into to-
morrow’s game with some new plays
which they will try for better or worse.

Throughout the week the drill has
been concentrated on offensive tactics,
and some results should be forth-
coming.

Must Watch Passes

Northwestern, too, has devoted most
of its practice time to polishing their
attack, as they doubt if Stagg will re-
veal anything too tricky. The Purple
is fond of gaining its ground through
the air and by sharp off-tackle thrusts.
Baker. Gustafson and Lewis do all
t-he ball-toting while Levinson has his
job because of his blocking ability.

Both elevens are intact physically,
except for Neff, Maroon linesman, who
will not play. The Northwestern line
has been troubled with numerous in-
juries, but the return of Rosie, 216
pound center, and Shuler, tackle, in-
sures it its full strength. Siebenmann,
guard, and Johnson, tackle, who are in
their third year of conference football,
are the stellar linesman. They with
Fisher, veteran end, constitute the

I-M GOLF TROPHY

WON BY STRONG PI

LAMBDA PHI TEAM

When the last little ball dropped
in the cup after leaving its trail be-
hind it in the snow the Intramural
department officially called the an-
nual golf tournament to a close and
started energetically to work to fig-
ure out the final scores. After much
tearing of hair1 they came to the con-
clusion that Pi Lambda Phi took first
place with a score of 155; Sigma Chi
putted their way to second; and Sig-
ma Nu attached themselves to third.

Jerome Debs took individual upper-
classman honors with a 75. Paul
Engberg won first in the freshman
division with a score of 79. Pi
Lambda Phi gets the team trophy
and the low man on each team wins
a medal.

NATIONAL VOCATIONAL
BUREAU AIDS SENIORS
IN FINDING POSITIONS

Seniors who are wondering what
to do next June will be interested to
know that there are two organiza-
tions at their disposal whose sole pur-
pose is to help people find vocations
for which they are fitted. The fre-
quent cry of the college orator to
“Choose your life work, don’t drift”
finds a ready enough reception, but
becomes a real problem when a per-
{ son tries to make an intelligent
choice.

The two organizations mentioned
are the Bureau of Vocational In-'
formation, 287 Fourth Avenue, New
York City and Occupational Informa-
tion Service, Lambertville, New Jer-
sey. The former deals exclusively
with vocations for women and is sup-
ported almost entirely by charity,
and the latter deals with men’s occu-

recreation school
VEACHES STUDENTS
OF MANY COLLEGES

This year’s class of the National
Recreation School has graduates of
thirty-one colleges and universities
including Brown, Chicago, Minne-
sota, University of Southern Califor-
nia, Wesleyan, Indiana, Columbia,
Syracuse, Reed College, McGill, Ne-
braska, Missouri and Purdue. Eigh-
teen states and Canada are represen-
ted in the training for the profession

of recreation leadership.

An unusual feature of this novel
kind of graduate school is that ev-
ery student is engaged in some out-
side employment which pays all or
part of his expenses. In the case of
many of the collegians, this is a ne-
cessity. But there is one man, the
son of a millionaire philanthropist,
who works on the side for the pure
fun of it.

The national recreation school is
the only institution in North America
which combines extensive training in
physical recreation with cultural rec-
reation.

What the world is like

Friday

Ever since I read the life story of two white rats
in Harper’s Magazine several months ago I have
had a different feeling for scientists * * * * Their
lives are not after all devoid of romance * * * *
And, if they choose, their long hours of research
may be productive of inspiring books * * * *

The book part of it is strikingly true just now, for
our press has just issued a fine science book that
has sixteen scientists for authors * * * * Every
Monday night last spring they met in one of our
conference rooms to read to each other the chap-
ters they had written * * * * One night fifteen of
them would listen while Forest Ray Moulton read
his story of Astronomy * * * * The next week
Julius Stieglitz, or Horatio Hackett Newman, or
Fay-Cooper Cole might be the author * * * * After
four months of writing, conferring, and rewriting
they told us that “The Nature of the World and of.
Man” was complete * * * * And now it is on the
book counters * * * *

This book was interesting in the making and now
in its final form it is, in the opinion of the Chicago
Daily News, “a tool for the work and play of a
work-and-play world ... a work of art no less than
a work of science.

What the advertising manager of the
University of Chicago Press might have
written in his diary if he had one.

HEE! HEE!

decided to carry canes as their in-
signia, I suggest that we senior
women should carry rolling-pins to
show them who are the real bosses! !

—June-1927

enson threw down their senior canes
and shouted gleefully, “Hurray, we
can see Europe in style next sum-
mer!”

—Lord Lloyd

One cannot tell the difference
’Tween the Senior and the Frosh;
Same clothes, same cars, same lines,
same booze—
They’re not revered, by gosh!
Four years have brought them lit-
tle gain;

So now they’re gonna wear a cane.

The Frosh take e’way the Seniors’
girls—

We know this isn’t right—

The Senior, stung and choked with
rage,
Sometimes are moved to fight.
Moral support—to keep them sane;

So now they’re gonna wear a cane.

Envoi:

No more brain, and no more gain,
Kiddish, vain, and they’re insane;
And so—they’re gonna
wear a cane!

—Sis

THE heights of our senior wrath
were aroused yesterday when a
beautiful little freshman woman, ap-
proaching us as we stood—cane in
hand—under the clock in Cobb, ex-
claimed, “My Dear! How DID you
sprain your ankle?

AMERTUME—(To B. W. T.)
It is done—that farce of ours
Entitled Love—a gilded scene
The curtain’s down—the time has
come

To wash the paint with tears that
clean

From off the face that seemed to
smile

At me—for such a little while
Upon that flimsy little stage
Which we had set to last an age!

—Astoniphronque

TERRIBLE TURK was walking
along, swinging his cane, yesterday
afternoon, whyn he noticed a Christ-
mas ad in the window of the U.
put the senior cane into his mouth,
of C. bookstore. “Ah,” he thought,
“Christmas is coming,” and his
thoughts went back to his happy
childhood Christmases, with their
stockings full of gayly colored toys
and sugarcanes. Absent mindedly he
sucking on it as he had often done
to sugarcanes, in the innocence of
childhood. But alas! Varnish and
shellac are not nearly so nourishing
as the pure sugar of the actual sug-
ar-cane, and Terrible Turk is now
laid up with what he proudly claims
to be the first case of Christmas
indigestion of the year! Which is
why we wrote the column today.

Fisher is a vital factor in North-
western's aerial game, being quite
adepf at snagging the throws of
Baker and Lewis.

Last night the Maroons put in their
longest drill of the season working
until 7 o’clock, despite the conference
ruling. A defense against North-
western plays was outlined, and the
varsity used their own plays in a
dummy scrimmage. Gleason and Lib-
by were used, so it is very probable
that the backs will sec action on Satur-
day.

THESE SENIOR canes seem to
emphasize some of the in-grown
habits of the boys. For example, Joh-
ny Meyer held his cane from the
wrong end, using it as a golf-club,
and swung at every stone or piece
of paper that he could find. Wendell
Bennett, on the other hand, kept
practising backhand and forehand
strokes, in anticipation of the Spring
tennis season. But Bill Stephenson
—shame on him—just couldn’t get
away from crooking his finger and
shoving his cane through it—as if he
were going to shoot the eiglyt-ball
into the end pocket!

QUEEN MARIE, Princess Illeana,
and the whole royal entourage are
going to visit our campus next Mon-
day. The fraternity men have decid-
ed that, upon being introduced to
them, one should kiss Queen Marie’s
hand. The boys, however, after tak-
ing a look at Princess Illeana’s pic-
ture, can not agree upon a suitable
form of greeting for her. "This kiss-
ing-the-hand-business is all right for
the Queen,” confides one prominent
member of the undergraduate coun-
cil, “But gee whiz, it’s too tame for
Princess Illeana. We must give her
a warmer welcome!”

REPORT ON THE DOINGS IN THE
PHOENIX OFFICE YESTERDAY

We have a suspicion that Col. Milt
Krienes and Walt Williamson used
the top end of their canes to rake
in some sort of a commission from
the cane manufacturer. Didn’t their
paper put the idea over?

Varsity swimming coach McGilli-

Intramural force, urged every under-
graduate who can swini a stroke to
commence practice for the Carnival.

“I will be glad to help any of the
aspirants who plan to enter the

carnival always brings out future
varsity material and it is a fitting
send-off to the annual swimming sea-
