Vol. 26 No. 100

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14, 1926

Price Five Cents

SENIORS ADD TO

ENDOWMENT OF

CLASS OF 1924

Alumni Support Class in
Plan to Create $200,000

Professorship

Backed by the University’s alumni,
the class of 1926 intends to continue
working on the scheme for the per-
manent endowment of professor-
ships which was one of the contribu-
tions of last year’s class to the Uni-
versity and which President Mason
intends to discuss in Chapel tomor-
row. The $15,500 raised by last
year’s class as a nucleus for the Bur.
ton Memorial Professorship will be
added to by every class until the nec-
essary $200,000 will have been ac-
cumulated if the plan the alumni and
the seniors are now working on is
retained long enough.

In a circular issued recently by the
Alumni Council the new scheme for
alumni endowment of professorships
is defended in three arguments. They
are: first, that this gift will be most
beneficial to the University; second
that it best expresses alumni appre-
ciation of the University; and third,
that it is sure of be of permanent
value. In support of these arguments
the circular said that money donated
by the graduating classes of former
years for special purposes had lain
idle in the University treasury, the
purpose of the donation being no
longer important and the class of-
ficers lost.

Each Senior to Pledge $50

Under the alumni plan the grad-
uating class is to raise as much
money as possible, each individual
to pledge fifty dollars. This is to be
paid in quarterly installments of
$2.50.

The Burton Memorial Professor-
ship is merely the first of the gifts
to be presented to the University by
graduating seniors in this way. The
plan has been made to embrace many
years and pictures a whole series of
professorships endowed by graduat-
ing classes. As each professorship is
completed a brass plate bearing the
name of the contributing classes and
the name of the professorship will
be placed somewhere in the Univer-
sity.

Class Council Supports Plan

The Senior Class Council is behind
this plan and hope to perpetuate it
by securing the support and co-oper-
ation of the other classes. The Alum-
ni Council thinks it can secure the
endowment of the Burton Memorial
Professorship within a comparative-
ly short time by appealing to friends
of Dr. Burton not connected with
the University.

“Twenty-Bottle”
or “Five-Yards”?

Mac Is Reticent

When Austin (“Five Yards”) Mc-
Carty sits down to his three square
meals at the Phi Gam house he finds
at the right of his plate a quart bot-
tle of milk, according to a report of
the Illinois Agricultural association.

In the trophy room of Austin’s fra-
ternity stands a silent monument to
the American cow and her contribution
to Chicago’s football victories. This
trophy, reposing beside the loving
cups won for athletic achievements, is
the first milk bottle emptied by Mc-
Carty when he entered the fraternity
life of his school.

The steward of Austin’s chapter
states that up until 1922, when Austin
became a member of the college or-
ganization, milk was used only for
cooking purposes. However, this fall
he found that he must order 20 bot-
tles of milk for each mealv Of these,
19 are pint bottles and one a quart.
Of course, McCarty’s place at the
table is decorated with the pint bot-
tles. He is said to be the best milk
drinker in the history of Phi Gamma
Delta.

KRUEGER SPEAKS ON
PRESENT TENDENCIES
IN GERMAN THEOLOGY

The Church History club, aided by the
Systematic Theology, and the New
Testament clubs, will jointly sponsor the
lecture given by Dr. Gustav Krueger to-
morrow at 7:30, in Theology 106. Prof.
Krueger’s lecture, on the topic of “Re-
cent Theological Tendencies in Ger-
many,” will be a continuation of the
lecture he delivered Monday, April 5,
at the official opening of the Divinity
school.

Professor Krueger is an authority on
church history and has lectured on this
subject at Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and
Michigan. He is a special professor for
the Spring quarter at the Divinity
school, where he has classes in Catho-
licism and Enlightenment.

Lambda Chi Moves
to Fraternity Row

Fraternity row along Woodland
avenue was recently amplified when
Lambda Chi Alpha purchased a
new home at 5739. The house,
which was formerly the property of
Mrs. Helen M. Tobin, is situated
between the Delta Kappa Epsilon
and Alpha Tau Omega houses.

The transfer from the old home
at 5721 Blackstone avenue was
made last Saturday. The new
house is of red brick, is three stories
high, contains thirteen rooms, and
is superior to the older building
both in the matter of size and prox-
imity to the campus.

WILKINS FETED

DINNER TONIGHT

Retiring Dean Honored at
Undergraduate Council

Banquet

Dean Wilkins, retiring from the
Deanship of the school of Arts Lit-
erature and Science here at the Uni-
versity, will be honored by a banquet
given tonight under the auspices of
the Undergraduate Council. Eighty-
five invitations have been sent out
to the students, and eighty are ex-
pected to attend. The sun parlor of
Ida Noyes hall is the place chosen
for the banquet and it will take place
at promptly seven o’clock.

| The choice of students invited to
{this affair was not based solely on
the rating they have on campsu. Al-
though many who received invita-
tions have a very enviable rating,
the basis from which the Undergrad-
uate council made the choice was the
positions they hold.

Faculty Members To Be Present

The faculty members who will be
present at this affair, with the ex-
ception of Dean Wilkins, are Prof.
Woodward, vice-president of the Uni-
versity, and Dean T. V. Smith. It
will be strictly an Undergraduate
function, and these faculty members
will make speeches.

Dean Wilkins has been a dean at
the University for two years, and it
is in appreciation of the magnanim-
ous sacrifices that he has made while
in this office that the Undergraduate
council sponsors this banquet.

Down to the Sea
In Ancient Buick;

Jump Cow Boat

By Milton Mayer

Bill Abbott and Kennie Pierce,
maties over at the Alpha Delt house,
had to go down to the sea again, and
they left Chicago yesterday bound for
Europe and all points east, via 1900
Buick, cattle boat and who knows
what.

Yielding to the irresistible urge, the
boys have departed for parts known
and unknown with the intention of
tying up in Scotland with one Alex-
ander Jones, a fraternity brother. On
Bastile Day, July 14, they are meet-
ing Tom Mulroy, Chuck Anderson,
and Sew Covert, whose indispensible
personages will grace the campus un-
til graduation.

Mulroy doesn’t know how the latter
group will get over there; Anderson
doesn’t know what they’ll live on when
they arrive; and Covert things they’ll
go around the world. At any rate, as
the cynic remarks, the boys are off.

I. S. A. ENTERTAINS
WITH PROGRAM AND
BUNCO PARTY FRIDAY

Folk dances, a bunco party, and
games will entertain the members of
the International Students’ Association
Friday evening at 8 in the theater of
Ida Noyes hall. Following the bunco
party, prizes will be awarded to high
score holders and the students will then
participate in folk dances and games.
The folk dances will all be characteristic
of the countries from which they have
been chosen and will include the Virginia
Reel.

Games which are familiar to the inhab-
itants of the different countries will also
be played. Following the games refresh-
ments will be served consisting of coffee
and wafers. “It is probable that before
the social there will be a short business
meeting in which a few immediate prob-
lems at hand will be discussed,” said
Mary Jones, chairman of the publicity
committee. All members of the associa-
tion are urged to attend and to bring
their friends.

Professional celebrities of the pen
appear in great numbers on the pages
of the “Celebrities number” of the
Phoenix than ever before in the his-
tory of the University, according to
those who are students of campus wit.

It seems that McClelland Barclay,
who is well known as one of Amer-
ica’s best artists, has executed a cover
from the head of a campus woman;
Stephen Leacock, popular writer, has
offered a snappy feature story; Ellis
Parker Butler, immortalized by “Pigs
Is Pigs,” is represented by a humor-
ous skit, and James Montgomery
Flagg gives us a genuine pen sketch
of none other than President Max
Mason himself. Add to this formid-
able array the “campus impressions”
of Julian Brozelton, Art editor of Col-
lege Humor, and you have what Fred
Handschy, editory of the Phoenix, be-
lieves will be one of the most scintilat-
ing issues of his well known journal
of wit.

And then there are the many excel-
lent feature tales of our own campus
writers which have been listed in long
and brilliant array.

By way of “modern verse” Fred
Handschy, the editor, is offering his
latest product from the pen of Bab-
ette Deutsche: “Persephone.”

This is the first time the paper has
made an attempt to feature celebrities.
According to reports they have been
very successful.

Work in this issue was started late
in the Winter quarter so that there
would be enough time for the celeb-
rities to submit their copy. When
writers intimated that they would
contribute telegrams were immedi-
ately sent.

Every corner of the United States
has been covered as well as an ocean
liner. Interesting bits from the let-
ters of those not sending material
will be included.

Saleswomen will report to the
Phoenix office tomorrow’ morning.

PRESENT STORY OF
“ANTIGONE” AT ETA
SIGMA PHI MEETING

Marion Woolsey, vice - president of
Eta Sigma Phi, will speak on the three
great writers of Greek tragedy, Euripi-
des, Aeschylus, and Sophocles, at a meet-
ing of the organization tomorrow at
1 :30 in Classics 20.

At this meeting, Georgia Robinson,
national secretary of the organization,
will outline the plot of “Antigone,”
which is to be presented by the club in
the latter part of May. Miss Robinson
will have the leading part in the presen-
tation. Each year a Greek or Roman
play is given.

Mona Flanders will tell about the con-
vention that she and Lambert Case, for-
mer president of the club, and Marjorie
Cooper, who was the third representa-
tive of the local club, visited April 1, 2,
and 3. This was the annual conference
of the Classical Association of the Mid-
dle West, and South, which was held
at the University o Illinois.

Courses by Radio?

“Hell!” Says Linn

Will the college student of the
future listen to his lectures via
radio, while comfortably reclining
in the privacy of his room, smok-
ing his pipe or enjoying a box of
hard centers? Oh, Hell,” is Teddy
Linn’s answer.

Mr. Linn was recently asked by
the Administrative office if he
would care to teach his English
249 course via radio. No details
of Mr. Linn’s answer are available
for publication, but no change has
been made as yet. At the present
time Mr. Linn’s lectures are heard
only by the limited audience of
Mr. Linn’s class in Cobb.

Seen Bimble? Fred

Got Check For Him

Who knows all about the absent-
minded professor? The professor,
of course. But he won’t tell. Who’ll
tell? The student, of course. And
Fred Handschy has given the low-
down to College Humor, and Col-
lege Humor is publishing it.

Handschy, who is editor of the
Phoenix, member of Kappa Sigma,
and literary man-about-campus has
submitted to the popular periodi-
cal a story called “The Bimbles,”
for which he received only yester-
day’ a letter of acceptance and a
check. This is his first venture
into the professional field of writ-
ing.

“The Bimbles” is a familiar por-
trait of one typically absent-minded
professor who has managed to
live with his wife and six collegiate
children for twenty years without
a relapse.

COMMERCE MEN

ELECTCOUNCIL

Announce Final Plans For
Banquet Friday

Students in the Commerce School
will elect members for the Com-
merce School Council, voting from 9
to 3 Thursday, on the sun-porch of
the Commerce School.

Any member of the School who
holds a B-average, or better, is
eligible to run for office. Nomina-
tions may be made by petition of
ten members of the Comerce School
as well as by the present Commerce
Council. The petitions must be in
the hands of Earl English, 5747
Elackstone Avenue by 1 today. The
voters will select two juniors, two
sophomores, two freshmen, two grad-
uate students, and* two members at j
large.

The annual banquet of the School
will be given at 6:45 p. m. on Fri-
day, at the Hyde Park Hotel. Mem-
bers of the new Council will be in-
stalled. Tickets are on sale at the
candy counter in the Commerce
building at 75 cents.

APPOINT SEVEN MEN
TO HONORARY RANK
OF CADET OFFICER

Honorary appointments of cadet offi-
cers in the University Field Artillery
R.O.T.C. have been announced by Major
Frederick Barrows, head of the Military
Science department. The men chosen
were Edwin T. Hellebrandt, Henry K.
Webster, Jr., Edwin C. Mattick, Claude
L. Brignall, Jack O. Stewart, J. Burton
Smith, and Louis W. Wulfehuhler, all
of whom received the honorary rank of
Cadet Second Lieutenant. The rank con-
ferred is purely honorary, and has no-
thing to do with the commissions as sec-
ond lieutenants in the Officers’ Reserve
corps, which the War department gives
to advanced students at the completion
of the course in the Military Science de-
partment.

The commissions are presented in
June or upon completion of the training
at summer camp. The number of men
who will receive commissions this year
will exceed twenty, a number which is
greater than those of previous years,
and is significant of the great growth of
the department in recent years, accord-
ing to Major Barrows.

“The appointments although hon-
orary in nature have been given to
these men because of their profici-
ency in the arts of Military Science,”
said Major Barrows.

LEADERS NAME

PARTNERS FOR

MILITARY BALL

Cundy and MacCracken Will
Lead With Mayer
and Wilson

Alta Cundy and Ellen McCracken
will lead the grand march of the
Military Ball with Herbert Mayer and
Hugh Wilson. The affair will be held
Friday, April 23, from 9 to 1 at the
South Shore Country Club.

Six women sponsors were also ap-
pointed to help manage the affair.
The women are: Margaret Hitt, Mar-
garet Bobbitt, Harriet Keeney, Car-
olyn Pratt, Esther Cook and Louise
Wietzer. The women were selected
by Major Barrows of the Military
Science department and will work
with the leaders in preparing for the
coming Prom.

Sponsors Head Committees

The six sponsore have each taken
charge of a committee, with campus
men to work with each woman. Peg
Hitt and Gerald Bench will handle
decorations; Margaret Bobbitt and
Eldred Neubauer, programs; Harriet
Keeney and Wally Schaefer, recep-
tion ; Carolyn Pratt and Herbert May-
er, music; Esther Cook and Hugh
Wilson, tickets; and Louise Weitzer
and Wilson, publicity.

Tickets went on sale yesterday.
Allotments have been distributed to
the fraterniies and an office has been
established in room 107, Cobb hall.
Three hundred tickets have been put
aside for graduate students and non-
fraternity men and may be obtained
at the office from Monday to Friday,
inclusive, between the hours of 1 to
3. According to Mayer, the tickets
are going—not like hot cakes—but
like tickets to the Military Ball al-
ways go.

“Coonie” Will Be There

The orchestra is Coon and Sanders’
original Kansas City Nighthawks.
They have been procured at great
expense and will make a special trip
to Chicago from Indianapolis, where
they are making an extended stay, to
fulfill their contract by furnishing
the music for the dance. The leaders
will be at the dance in person and
“Coonie” is expected to put on the
style of program that nightly has
entertained thousands from the In-
somnia Club through KYW, the
Westinghouse station on the Con-
gress Hotel.

The Military Ball is an annual fea-
ture of University social life,the first
one having been given last year.
The Coon-Sanders orchestra is ex-
pected to add to the prestige of the
event as it is one of the best known
organizations operating in this part
of the country. Their recent activ-
itoes in Cincinnatti have added to
their reputation, for they have been
broadcasting regularly. “The Night-
hawk Blues” is probably their most
famous production. It was writtten
and first played by them.

PLAN ANNUAL DELTHO
SPRING SCHOLARSHIP
DANCE FOR SATURDAY

Members of Deltho will give their
annual Spring dance for the benefit of
the Deltho Scholarship fund on Satur-
day evening at the Cooper-Carlton hotel.
An affair of this kind has been given for
some years.

Patronesses for the affair are Miss
Charlotte Foye and Mrs. Carl Moore.
Virginia Hardt, who is in charge of the
dance, with a group of assistants, has
made elaborate plans for the affair and
promised that it will excel those of for-
mer years. Bill Hahn’s College Crew,
well known to the University campus,
will furnish the syncopation. Tickets
have been placed on sale at two dollars.

The proceeds from the dance will
go to a scholarship fund of the club
to help deserving students which the
club selects. ।

A LITTLE TRIBUTE

'T'HE great names, the boasted authorities in this depart-
1 ment or that, are not the only assets of a University fac-
ulty. Other men contribute services just as necessary; yet
the world never hears of them. They are quiet scholars
whose names never blaze from' newspaper headlines, and
patient teachers whose epigrams are never quoted at fratern-
ity dinner-tables. Yet they advance the standards of human
knowledge far, and win recruits to push them farther. More
than that, they teach something worth knowing about life.

They are not picturesque; they leave no deep impression
on their pupils the first day of the quarter; they neither pound
the table nor enchant the ear. Nothing about them is stagey.
Hence the world, which likes to talk about picturesque things,
seldom talks about them. But that same world, which is
governed after all by calmer things, will show their force
though it never knows their names.

They toil at problems that make the outsider laugh, and
know that this same outsider will some day benefit from
their work. They start young scholars in their own paths, to
carry on where they stop. And they do something that is
worth still more. They teach their pupils that life is not a
matter of bravado and heroism, that man does not progress
in magnificent strides, that its battles are not glorious cru-
sades. They stress the value of patience and calm study.
They know that the work of the world is sometimes bore-
some, and they do not dodge the fact. If their less patient
pupils sometimes sleep in class, it is because those pupils
have not yet mastered one great truth: that life is largely a
sordid, dull thing, and must be accepted as such. This truth,
hard as it is for us, man has never escaped. The business of
the race is nine-tenths drudgery. Our calmer, wiser teachers
have accepted this truth, and have gone to their task undis-
mayed. Unthinking, we accuse them of being dull, when
often the dullness is of life itself. Silenus, writing his some-
what excited column in our Supplement, calls them worse
than dull. But they work on, heeding neither praise nor
blame.

An editorial here is small pay for a life so dedicated; but
we (who have learned as editor something of the drudgery of
life) now offer it.

Kisses endured . . kisses of daylight.

KISSES ... as evening sinks to
darkened night . . Sparkling scintil-
lating, starlike . . kisses. Life’s wine
imbibing . . heady. Lips . . slowly
parting . . moistened . . closer merg-
ing . . soul in soul. Kisses that sear

Appeals have been made by the
United Charities of Chicago to the
fraternities and other organizations
on the campus for help in raising
$300,000 to take care of their bud-
get. The Daily Maroon has offered
its services to receive and tabulate all
subscriptions.

The policy of the United Charities
has always been to appeal to a wide
scope for small amounts, and for this
reason they have solicited the frater-
nities and clubs on the campus to
raise a small sum and submit it to
the Maroon office as soon as possible.
They urge that this question be
brought up at the next meeting, for
they feel that all organizations will
be willing to engage in the work.
The amount asked from each is a
very nominal sum, for they consider
that $10 is sufficient to place the or-
ganization on the Honor Roll.

Frosh Diamond Aspirants Report for Practice Under Coach Crisler

YEARLING BALL

TEAM IS GREEN,
CRISLER OPINES

Need More Men Out For
Squad; Offer Chance
For Numerals

Freshman baseball practice offici-
ally began yesterday afternoon when
the wonderful spring weather made
it a great “ball day,” not only for the
major leaguers, but for the Maroon
yearlings. There were enough fresh-
men aspirants out for the team yes-
terday to make two full nines, but
it was their first time out and no
game was held. Insead, Fritz Cris-
ler gave them a stiff work-out on
some preliminary exercises and lim-
bering-up practice. Hurling and bat-
ting the ball around the lot at Green-
wood Avenue and Fifty-Sixth Street
made up the greater part of yester-
day’s work-out, but it served to warm
up the candidates for the team and

to familiarize Coach Crisler with
individual work of his men.

Outlook Not Bright

In looking over the material
this years outfit, Crisler was not

the

for
too

hopeful as to the prospects for a
strong Frosh Nine again this year,
and emphasized the fact that most
of the candidates seem quite green.
He stressed the fact that every yearl-
ing who would like to try out for the
squad this spring should not hesi-
tate to do so because of lacking ex-
perience. “Any one who can swing
a bat and throw a ball has the chance
to develop into i good ball player,”
remarked Fritz, “and Freshmen prac-
tice is held primarily for this pur-
pose.

Especially this year will new men
have a good chance to make the team
due to the greenness and scarcity of
material. Practice is held from two
until four every schoolday afternoon
on the practice diamond across from
Stagg Field on 56th Street. Later in
the season, the Frosh will have the
customary bi-weekly tilts with Nels
Norgren’s varsity, on the latter’s

field across the Midway.

Ten Bright Lights

Outstanding candidates
year’s outfit are few in

for this
number.

Among those showing up well in the
initial session yesterday were Kap-
lan, Cassie, Cohn, and Bohan. Kap-
lan and Cohn are good prospects for
the hurling job, both having seen
mound duty at other schools. The
former, who was a numeral man in
basketball, pitched good ball at En-
glewood High School for two years.
Cohn has had experience at Illinois
College, where he was pitcher for
two years.

There is an opening on the team
for a catcher as there were no candi-
dates for that job among those who
reported yesterday. Every other posi-
tion is taken care of. Among those
trying for the various infield and
outfield jobs are Fritzfall, Draban-
sky, Davis, Burkenshaw, Wilkins,
Ault, Svatik, Blankenstine, and
Kirsheimer.

For Tennis Squad

Individual stars appear to be
lacking on the tennis team line-
up, but if pre-season indications
hold good the team will neverthe-
less be stronger than was last
year’s aggregation. The 1925 con-
tests found Chicago coming out
just even, the team number of
wins being just about equal to the
number of iosses. The absence of
George Lott from the outfit is
keenly felt but the way the figur-
ing stands the seconds and thirds
that are sure will enable the team
to carry off the honors in a good-
ly proportion of their contests,
which will be as follows:

May 3—Iowa at Chicago.

May 8—Illinois at Urbana.

May 11—Northwestern at Chi-

RE-ELECT NOYES
SPLASH CAPTAIN

FOR NEXT YEAR

Name Parker Hall Water
Polo Squad Leader
For 1927

At a dinner held Monday evening
at Hutchinson Commons, Captain Ed.
Noyes was rejected to the captain-
ship of the 1926-1927 swimming
squad. Parker Hall was elected to
the leadership of the water polo
team for next year in place of John
Petrolewitz, who captained the polo-
ists this season+hrough a fairly suc-
cessful schedule.

NETMEN PRESENT

FINE APPEARANCE,

Doctor Reed Plans Fair
Elimination Meet

, Doctor Reed’s tennis squad is al-
ready functioning in nearly mid-
season form, as a result of the early
start that they succeeded in getting
last week when the weather was nice
enough for practise. Doctor Reed,
who has been the tennis coach since
1913 and who has in that time
brought eighteen conference cham-
pionships of various sorts to the Uni-
versity, is rejoicing for he has four
veterans from last year in his squad.

Only McCarthy and Valentine of
last year’s outfit are graduating and
Capt. Schaeffer, Hudlin, Bennett,
and Parker Hall are left. In addi-
tion to these* Shapinsky, last year’s
freshment tournament winner is also
wearing the maroon sweat shirt of
the team. Then there are about a
dozen other men, all good who are
performing daily. All of these men
seem to have the necessary agility
and ability.

Using a very fair method of chas-
ing his team, Doctor Reed will prob-
ably have his elimination contests
next week and the winners of the
last rounds will represent Chicago
in the session’s meets.

With both Hall and “Trolley”
back again next year, bright hopes
are prevalent among the water polo
players. Coach Mac Gillivray looks
to a conference championship squad
for next year.

Although the just finished swim
season was only fairly good form the
viewpoint of the Maroons, with
Noyes once more captain, the squad
should come through very well next
year. Most of the present men wall
be back and several frosh stars will
j be eligible for competition.

Noyes is a member of Iron Mask
and is president of Beta Theta Pi.
He won his C in swimming and was
elected captain while a sophomore.
This season he was one of the main-
stays of the team although ill at the
time of the conference meet. With
Oker of this year’s freshman squad
in competition next year. Noyes’
team will be expected by th'* critics
to make a good record.

HOLD TRACK MEET
TO FIND MATERIAL

In a practice track meet held last
night in Bartlett Gym, Jim Cusack
won the mile event in 4:36. Gifford
Hitz came in second.

The meet was held to give green,
untried members of the squad a
chance to “strut their stuff” and the
coaches were rather pleased with the
results.

Stadium Contractors
Hurry Construction

Contractor Scheidenheim has
actually sprung a surpise on the
university officials. The surprise
is that for once a contractor is
keeping his word and the work on
the new stadium is going forward
at a faster pace than any building
work hereabouts ever has.

Stagg field is in torn up condi-
tion, yet, paradoxically, every-
thing is going on in perfect order.
The old wood stands have all been
moved up against the east wall,
and their foundations have all
been pulled out; the pouring of
the cement for the piles was start-
ed yesterday, and already a grand
total of over one thousand loads
of earth has been excavated and
dumped in a neat heap.

So everyone is surprised, but
for once the surprise, it seems, is
very agreeable.

WOMEN ARCHERS

RESUME CLASSES

Was Discontinued for Ten
Year Period

After a lapse of ten years, wom-
; en’s classes in archery have beefi re-
sumed at the University this quarter.
Classes in this sport are meeting
daily, with a total registration of six-
ty-nine members. No outdoor prac-
tise has been held yet, the class-work
I being confined to the acquisition of
the correct form.

This sport was formerly a favorite
j at the University but interest in it
waned several years ago, and it was
discontinued for a time. Recently, it
has received a great deal of atten-
tion at other colleges throughout the
country, and the local classes were
re-established upon popular demand.
At other colleges it has become a
organized sport, rivaling tennis and
golf as the most popular diversion
of the spring and summer seasons.

TRAVELS TO PURPLE CAMPUS FOR

INITIAL CONTEST AGAINST ONCE
DEFEATED NORTH SHORE SQUAD

Look to Conference Championship as 1926 Season Opens;
Gubbins, Newly Elected Captain, to
Lead Strong Local Team

By Irving Goodman

With eager eyes focused on a Big
Ten Title, Nelson Norgren’s highly-
rated Maroons will officially usher in
the Chicago Conference diamond
race this afternoon when they meet
Maurie Kent’s Purple horsehide man-
ipulators. Northwestern has not
shown up strong in its few practice
tilts, but nevertheless is a danger-
ous opponent for Chicago at this
early stage of the season. Capt. Bill
Christman of the Evanston squad is
a star fielder and timely hitter and
should prove the most troublesome
for the Midway pitchers.

Much Speculation

There is considerable speculation
as to what lineup Norgie will use in
the opener. The newly elected cap-
tain, Joie Gubbins, and Jimmy Web-
ster will undoubtedly be the battery

choice. Claude Brignall and Mc-
Connell are assured of the third base
and shortstop berths while the key-
stone sack and first base is causing
Norgren much worry. There are
many likely candidates for both posi-
tions. At second the competition
narrows down to Kyle Anderson,
Chuck Hoerger, and Tex Gordon.
Roy Price, Cunningham’s understudy
last year, John McDonough, and
Cooper, former Lindblom star, are
waging a close battle for the first
sack.

Wallie Marks will cover right field
assisted by Bill Macklind in center,
while Russel Pierce may bask in the
left field garden. Thus the outfield
is well fortified in hitting and field-
ing, for both Marks and Macklind
are veteran sluggers from last year’s
team.
