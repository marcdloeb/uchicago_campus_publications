UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1926

Two former
prominent priv-
ity men were
named for im-
portant posts.

Price Five Cento

^H4T OP JENKINS NAMED

IT?

SECRETARY OF

ALUMNI GROUP

There have been many ways in his-
tory in which football teams have tak-
en the field. Sometimes they have
walked out stolidly, foredoomed to de-
feat, and knowing it. Sometimes they
have rushed out wildly onto the green
patch of battleground, wild in their
desperation against impossible odds-
like that Chicago team of 1924 that
held Grange and Illinois to a 2l-a1l
tie. Sometimes like Bo McMillin’s
Center College team in the Harvard
Stadium in 1922, they have gone out
and knelt down to pray. All these
manners of going out to die for the
old school have been seen in years
gone by. But not till last Saturday
did a startled world ever see a team
take the field piping psalms of hope
and hymns of victory.

Mr. Stagg led his Maroons out be-
fore the Florida game singing, there
was a general air of mystification
among the boys in the bleachers. Some
knowing that the Old Man’s crop of
horseflesh was not so rosy as in other
years, insisted that the boys were
singing to keep up their failing spirits.
Others offered no expiations—they
merely made the most of what, from
some points of view was a very funny
phenomenon. There was something
just a hit ludicrous about the situa-
tion, the boys felt. Here were Mr.
Stagg’s Maroons singing—and singing
very, very seriously—something that
might well have been “Onward Chjis-
tion Soldiers,” but really was “Flag
of Maroon” and “We Are Chicago,”
the latter one of the more sour num-
bers from the most recent Blackfriars
show. So the boys enjoyed it to the
full. True, one of them, midway in
the second number rendered by Mr.
Stagg’s boys, caleld out brusquely,
“Throw ’em a herring.” But for the
most part it was taken in good stead.
It seems, however, that it was all for
a purpose. The boys, later advices
showed, have been singing their songs
every noon between courses over at
the Windermere. Saturday’s per-
formance was nothing new for them,
however it might have affected the
customers. The songs. Mr. Stagg felt
when he first set the boys to singing,
would develop a feeling of unity, of
common aim and reliance—in short, a
sort of esprit de corps. It sounds
plausible enough.

' ♦ * * *

There is, indeed, only one jarring
note in the whole program outlined
by Mr. Stagg and carried out, basso
and tenor, by the boys. The said note
has to do with the question of whether
Mr. Stagg has not shifted his policy
on his men singing before their games
since last fall. It is a well-remembered
fact that the Old Man somewhat curt-
lyinformed Mr. Graham Kernwein, the
upright halfback and prom leader of a
year ago, that singing had no part in
the preparation for a game that gave
every indication of being real and
earnest. This rebuff resulted from the
fact that Mr. Kernwein was unburden-
ing his tonsils on the feted air of
Champaign just before taking the field
for dear old alma mater against Mr.
Grange and ten other rough little boys.

* * * *

If Mr. Stagg is to be consistent in
his policy (that status quo, that is, ex-
isting at the time of the Illinois game
last autumn), he must cut the singing
act from now on. For Mr. Stagg’s
football team beginning next Saturday
with Maryland and continuing through
the season, is going to face football
teams which will make the day’s fray
every bit as real and earnest as Illi-
nois was capable of last' fall. As for
last Saturday’s singing, Mr. Stagg can
laugh it off by saying, as ensuing
events proved true, that Florida wasn’t
so tough and he knew it, and let his
Christian Soldiers sing because he did.

Adolph G. Pierrot Leaves
University for

Business

W. Robert Jenkins, '24, has been
named secretary of the University
Alumni association to succeed
Adolph G. Pierrot, who left the uni-
versity October 1. Mr. Jenkins will
assume his duties at once.

Mr. Jenkins, son of the president
of the University of Omaha, received
his college degree at that school, and
came to the University as an under-
graduate, taking his bacheloriate of
philosophy in 1924.

Active On Campus

While an undergraduate, Mr. Jen-
kins was prominent in campus activ-
ities, being “leading lady” in “Film-
ing of Friars.” He was editor of the
Phoenix, active in dramatics, and a
member of Chi Psi fraternity.

Since his graduation Mr. Jenkins
has been in the publishing and ad-
vertising business.

Worked Hard

For nine year Mr. Pierrot held the
position of Alumni secretary and
editor of the alumni magazine. He
is credited with the development of
Chicago’s huge alumni association,
and took a prominent part in the
campaign drives. He is a member of
the class of ’07, of Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, Phi Delta Phi, Delta Zeta
Rho, Acacia, and the Masonic order.
Mr. Pierrot will assume the vice-
presidency of Teninga Bros, and Co.,
real estate firm.

Assyrian Prince
Masquerading As
Student — Found

Among the notables now in school
is S:|muel K. David or Samuel Khan-
ninia H. Kahn, as this student of royal
birth is called when at home in As-
syria.

Mr. Kahn is entering the University
with seventeen majors advanced
standing and has shown remarkable
ability as a literary and technical stu-
dent. Prince Samuel is a direct des-
cendant of the Royal family which has
been ruling in Assyria for two thou-
sand years. His cousin, the reigning
king of Assyria, is a student at Ox-
ford and Lady Surma, another cousin,
is acting Ambassador to the United
States and has served in the same
position in England. Lady Surma is
now in New York following a so-
journ of political nature in Washing-
ton, D. C., two weeks ago.

CHICAGO UNIT COPS

PRIZES AT SPARTA

In competition with a number of
other amateur so diers spending the
summer at Camp Sparta, Burton
Sn ith of the University fired the
highest individual score in the pistol
competition. The Chicago team fin-
ished the pistol competition with a
good lead.

Twenty-nine cadets from- the local
unit of the Reserve Officers Training
Corps went to camp in decrepit fliv-
vers or “bummed” rides and in a few
weeks even purchased railroad tickets.
The camp lasted six weeks during the
mon^is of June and July. Students
from the Universities of Illinois and
Wisconsin also attended.

The presence of three “C” men in
ranks, Marks, Hobscheid and Brgnall,
made Chicago the undefeated cham-
pions in baseball. The Chicago con-
tingent likewise won their boxing
matches with the exception of one.
Hobscheid fought O’Connell of Illi-
nois to a draw in the heavyweight
class.

‘Hurricane Kid’ to
Get Greek Rush

“Hurricane Kid” has been select-
ed as the official appellative to don
the latest addition to the pets of the
University. The “Kid” is the al-
ligator presented to Captain Marks
by Captain Saara of the University
of Florida team before the game
last Saturday.

Thinking that such a noted being
should be decked out, Wallie went
down to the nearest harness shop
and bought a special suit for the
’gator which is seventeen years old
and would return to the land of re-
altors if given half a chance.

There is a rumor afoot to the
effect that Wallie intends to take
him over to the Sigma Nu house
and offer him up as a pledge, but
so far this story has not been veri-
fied.

O’HARA ADVISES;
GREENCAPPERS

Neophytes Assigned Duties
At First of Weekly

Luncheons

Candidates for the Green Cap, fresh-
man honor society, learned the ways
and means of campus life when Frank
Huburt O’Hara, director of student ac-
tivities, addressed them yesterday at
the first of four weekly luncheons at
the Disciples of Christ Church.

About 140 “its” appeared for their
introduction into the period of bully-
ing that precedes admission into the
honor group. Speaking lor President
Mason, who is ill, Mr. O’Hara told the
neophytes the purpose and benefits of
their training. “While the apparently
stupid stunts that you will endure may
seem valueless, they are not for the
purpose of hazing and are not the
fundamental purpose of the society,”
Mr. O’Hara told the freshmen. “By
the time your candidacy has ended, the
entire group will have learned the hu-
mility that should prevail among fresh-
men, and the future leaders of campus
life will have appeared a^ve the hori-
zon.”

DISCUSS PLANS FOR
YEAR’S PROGRAM AT
FEDERATION TONIGHT

Work that has been accomplished
throughout the summer and during
Freshmen week, and a prospectus of
the program for the coming quarter
will be discussed at an open-council
meeting of Federation tonight, at 7 in
the library of Ida Noyes hall. Each
chairman will review what has been
done by her committee and explain in
general the field it covers.

Miss Elizabeth Wallace, professor
of French Literature, will talk, unify-
ing the reports and discussions into a
whole impression of Federation. “The
meeting will be open to all women and
is primarily a discussion meeting. It
is hoped that we will find out from the
Freshmen themselves their reactions
to Freshman week,” said Helen King,
chairman of upperclass counsellors.
“In addition to this, the meeting will
give an excellent opportunity for the
the organization and work of Federa-
tion.”

“A social hour will follow the dis-
cussion and we hope that all will re-
main,” continued Miss King.

“C” Hand Books On

Sale at Bookstores

Student “C” Hand-books, official
guide to the campus, have arrived
and are on sale for twenty-five cents
each at the University bookstore and
at Wood worth’s. The hand books are
indispensible to newcomers on the
campus and are good “date-books”
for upper-classmen, because they fur-
nish all information for students at
the University.

E. ENGLISH TO
HOLD STUDENT
PURSE-STRINGS

Woodward Appoints Alum-
nus Auditor of Student

Accounts

Earle English, former business
manager of the Cap and Gown and a
University Marshal last year, re-
ceived appointment yesterday as au-
ditor of student accounts. The ap-
pointment was announced by Prof.
Frederick C. Woodward, vice-presi-
dent of the University.

“Appointment of an auditor to de-
vote full time to student activities,”
the Vice-president said, “grows out
of an increasing demand for helpful
guidance and follows the joint rec-
ommendation of a committee of the
Board of Student Organizations and
of the Undergraduate council. It is
in line with the practice noy being
adopted in all leading universities.”

Trains At Ohio

Mr. English, who was graduated
from the School of Commerce and
Administration last spring, studied
auditing systems at Ohio State Uni-
versity at Columbus recently with a
view of training himself for the
position of auditor. The position it-
self is not a new one, as the Univer-
sity has always provided for the au-
diting of accour^S. The new fea-
ture is that Mr. English will give his
entire time to rendering whatever as-
sistance is possible to all students in
all activities.

The activities that Mr. English will
work with include all publications,
dramatic productions, proms, class
societies, but do not include frater-

committee of Y. W. C. A. and Federa-
tion will be hostesses at an informal
tea for women who are transferring
from other colleges, tomorrow at 3:30,
in the Y. W. room of Ida Noyes hall.
Transfer students who were on cam-
pus last year are urged to be present
as well as the entering women, accord-
ing to Dorothy Mosiman, chairman
of the committee.

A definite program has not been
arranged, as this is the first of a series
of teas to be given throughout the
year. The committee will confine thei’
efforts tomorrow to helping the women
become acquainted.

It is necessary to have the tea early
so that those who wish may attend the
lecture to be given by the Bishop of
London at 4:30.

Frederick Stock Symphony Or-
chestra will give its first campus re-
cital on October 19 in Mandel hall. As

A special program has been planned
for this year. On December 14 Ernst
Von Dohnanyi, pianist, will give a re-
cital. A Cappella Choir has been se-
cured for February 1 and Dusolina
Giannini, soprano, comes to the cam-
pus March 1.

Maroon Influential

In Europe:—Mulroy

Zipping across the English Chan-
nel at over a hundred miles an hour,
sitting in with the profound Brit-
ish statesmen at the Hall of Com-
mons, seeing the supposedly wild
Parisian life “as is” in the famous
Latin Quarter, such were a few of
the unusual experiences of Tom
Mulroy, former head of the Inter-
scholastic Commission, and Chuck
Anderson, last year’s President of
the Undergraduate Council, who
toured Europe from June 26 to Au-
gust 20.

“We had to pose as foreign cor-
respondents of the Daily Maroon
and produce our Maroon cards to
gain an entrance to the House of
Commons,” laughed Mulroy. In
Europe they met several former U.
of C. students, including Bill Ab-
bott and Kenneth Pierce.

DRIVE FOR[KIDS

STARTS NOV. 1

Novelties Planned For
Campaign

Plans for the University of Chicago
Settlement Fund Drive, as announced
by James P. Hall, co-chairman, call
for an intensive campaign for contri-
butions, which will begin the first
week in November. The sub-chair-
men, who are to form the back-bone
of the student organization for solicit-
ing funds for the settlement, will be
announced at the first of next week.
The co-chairmen who head the drive
are Esther Cook, Holmes Boynton,
Mary Harvey and Hall.

Several new features are being
planned to make this year’s drive
unique and different from those of
previous years. Large balloons, ad-
vertising the drive, are to be released
at some of the important football
games in November. Visits to the Set-
tlement House are to be organized
this fall by those in charge of the
drive, so that students can better learn
exactly what they are helping to sup-
port and to enable them to see just
what their money is being used for.

PUBLICATIONS BOARD
ELECTS PRESIDENT
TODAY IN MEETING

Editors and business managers of
The Cap and Gown, The Phoenix,
The Journal of Business and The
Daily Maroon will meet today at 2:30
in Mr. O’Hara’s offic e to elect the
president of the Board of Publications.
The man elected will sit as a voting
member on the Undergraduate coun-
cil.

The election of a president was
postponed until this quarter when
twelve ballots at last spring’s election
resulted in a deadlock. The presiden-
cy of the board of publications means
not only representation of the campus
scribes on the student governing body
but also the directorship of journal-
istic policy.

“Now that the men on the board
know each other they should be able
to select as their chief one who is
capable of voicing their opinions be-
fore the council,” declared Mr. O’Hara
adviser of the board. “The position is
the only possible means of establishing
harmony between the publications
and the other departments of student
administration.”

Women’s Board To
Plan Year’s Work

Board of Women’s Organizations
will meet tomorrow at 12:30 in the
Alumnae room of Ida Noyes hall to
formulate plans for the new year.
Harriett Keeney, president o f the
Board, requests that all members be
present as reports of Freshmen week
will be discussed and other import-
ant business brought up.

earned the title of Doctor of Philoso-
phy at the University of Chicago.

From 1907 to 1908, Professor Stev-
ens taught Latin and English in Mer-
rill, Wisconsin. From there he went
to Northwestern university, teaching
English for two years, then to become

receiving the Ph. D. degree from the
University of Chicago, he began teach-
ing English here. He was given a
Captaincy in the Military Intelligence
Division, at Washington, where he
served from 1918 to June of 1919. Re-
turning to the University of Chicago in
October of 1919, he began teaching

A MONG the inhabitants of such backwoods burgs as Day ton, Ten-
nessee and Polka Dotte, Ohio, the University of Chicago is in
very bad odor, as the center of a corrupt ring of devil’s disciples who

are intent on making scoffers and atheists of our young men
women. We are amused.

and

Our experience with this vast conspiracy which spreads its
acles over the whole country has been strangely disappointing.

ten-

We

have searched long and diligently among the syndics of this great
University without even digging up a consistent religious policy. And
we have found very few who so much as agreed on the fundamentals
of dogma.

The growth of such a myth, we venture, is due to the univer-
sity’s most obvious religious policy, that of frank liberality, with the
emphasis on individually rather than on standardzation. We find
that policy highly commendable, and indeed inevitable, is such a
community as ours.

This liberality, however, is not the university’s sole policy, when
the living religions of its students are affected. Liberality is in itself
negative. We have found the faculty as individuals to b equite posi-
tively interested in the religious welfare of the student body. They
urge the study of religion as a fascinating field of interest. They urge
the practice of religious worship both as an uplifting experience and
as a communion with divinity. They urge the religious way of life
as the way of truest happiness.

We indite this comment not in any sense as an answer to the
feeble alarums from Dayton, Polka Dotte and the denominational
weeklies. We hope merely that it may dispel the doubts which often
trouble freshmen, and worry the more credulous of parents.

GREEN CAPS

FRESHMAN WEEK is over. But freshmen remain. The week of
super-courtesy, of solicitous care, of attentive inquiry and ad-
vice is over. And freshmen now begin to assume their proper place

in the order of things.

i

Part of that place is denoted by the symbolic green cap, tradi-
tional head wear of first year men for many decades. It is not an ad-
vertisement of ignorance and ingenuousness. It is a badge of class
loyalty.

Freshmen should need no inducement to loyalty. But occasion-
ally it is necessary to thrust loyalty upon them.

In discussing the appointment, Mr.
Woodward said, “While budgets and
audits are required as heretofore, the
primary object in creating the full
time position is to put at the dis-
posal of students the experience and
advice of an especially trained au-
ditor who will hope, of course, at the
same time, to encourage student in-
itiative.

Camels add the charm of living

WHETHER through the tasks of
every day, or in life’s moments of
crisis and great reward, the com-
fort and understanding of Camel
cheers us on our way. For no other
cigarette was ever so friendly, so
loyal as Camel. The unfathomed
goodness, the deep underlying
quality of Camel tobaccos is
ever-dependable.

The world’s largest tobacco or-
ganization buys the best of every-
thing for Camels. The choicest
Turkish and Domestic tobaccos

grown. The kind of blending that
only such a group of experts could
give. Regardless of what you are
willing to pay, there is no other
cigarette like Camel; there can be
no better cigarette made than
Camels. Camels never tire the
taste, no matter how indefatigably
you smoke them, never leave a
cigaretty after-taste.

If you don’t yet know Camel
enjoyment, just sample the most
exquisite fragrance that ever came
from a cigarette. Have a Camel!

EIGHTY-EIGHT FRESHMEN REPORT FOR

OPENING PRACTICE

>--------------------------

CROSS COUNTRY

HOPES BOOSTED

BY SOPHOMORES

Gist, Williams, Burke and
Coles Aid Veterans;

Old Man Coaches

For the first time since the sport
was started the cross-country team
will be under the personal direction
of Coach Stagg. Heretofore the foot-
ball team has taken up all of Stagg’s
time, but this season the time has
been arranged so that the varsity
long distance men will receive the
benefits of the “Old Man’s” coach-
ing.

Expect Good. Year

Although a severe loss was suffer-
ed through the graduation of Cap-
tain Owens, one of the stellar per-
formers of the conference, Coach
Stagg is looking forward to a big
year, and expects the boys to be
right on top when the final standings
are published.

Four Veteran*

Armstrong, Balleart, Dystrup, and
Hegovic are the men to return from
last year’s squad. It is on last sea-
son’s freshman, however, that the
full brunt of the work will be placed.
Four phenomenal freshmen track-
sters ure the hope of this year’s var-
sity squad. Dick Williams, Wake-
field Burke, Rudy Coles, and Gist are
expected to turn in big records. Oth-
er sophomores axe Ault. Jackson and
Klassman.

Stagg Drives Line To. Iron Out Weak
Spots Before Tough Maryland Battle

I-M Booklet Off
The Press Today

The Intramural booklet, contain-
ing all the official information of the
department’s activities for the fall
quarter will be off the press today.
In it are the horse-shoe pitching and
touchball schedules as well as the
new intramural rulings. The booklets
will be distributed through fraternity
representatives and at Chapel next
Monday morning.

Touchball will open with a bang on
October 12 when six games will be
played. Barnyard golf will start Oc-
tober 13, fifteen games being run off
on that date. The schedules will close
November 9 and 10 respectively.

Besides the fraternity league there
will be graduate and non-fraternity
divisions. Entries in all leagues are
to be made as soon as possible.

As usual there will be five divi-
sions, six teams to a division. The
first two in each will go into the
semi-finals. Cups will be given to the
league winners and runners up as
well as trophies to the first, second,
and third places in the finals. In
touchball, medalettes are offered to
league winners and school champions
while only the first, second, and
third finalists will get them in horse-
shoes.

The Maroon line is in for a busy
week if yesterday’s practice was any
indication. Coach Stagg was dis-
pleased for the most part with the
antics of this portion of his team
during the Florida game and will
spend the whole week ironing out the
defects.

A heavy scrimmage will mark to-
day’s drill. The freshman team us-
ing Maryland plays given to them
by Campbell Dicksbn, will buck up
against the varsity. Dickson scouted
the Maryland-South Carolina game
Saturday when South Carolina
staged an upset and won 12-0. The
men who did not see action Satur-
day will be given plenty of oppor-
tunity to work in today’s drill.

No Injuries

No serious injuries were sustained
by the Maroons Saturday, according
to Trainer Benson. Spence received
a slight ankle sprain, K. Rouse re-
ceived a leg bruise, S. Rouse a sore
chest and Garon has an infected heel.
All these men reported for practice
yesterday and will be ready to play
Saturday against Maryland.

The showing of Weislow, Spence,
and Hancock, new linesmen in the
Florida game pleased the coaches. The 1
veterans lived up to expectations. Stan
Rouse played in all-around good form.
He will undoubtedly Stagg’s best run-
ning threat and he showed himself to
be a consistent drop-kicker.

Ex-Maroons Are

Foes In Pro Game

While on former Maroon en-
joyed the fruits of victory two
others suffered the pangs of de-
feat Sunday afternoon when the
Chicago Cards overwhelmed the
Racine professional grid team 20
to 0 at Normal Park Sunday after-
noon.

Gene Francis, 1925 fullback on
the University of Chicago eleven,
playing at his familiar position
with the Cards was partially re-
sponsible for the humiliation hand-
ed his ex-teammates, Kernwein
and Hobscheid, who were playing
under the colors of Racine.

PLAN COURSE FOR
FACULTY NATATORS

Women of the Faculty and wives of
faculty member, who desire to become
mermaids, “Trudies,’’ or who wish to
spend an enjoyable hour will be given
the opportunity of a one hour swim
each week. Classes begin Tuesday,
Oct. 12, from 9 to 10 in the pool of
Ida Noyes.

Physical examinations will be given
tomorrow in Ida Noyes hall. Appoint-
ments should be made at once as these
examinations are required. Two dol-
lars will be charged as fee to pay
for the lessons. Towel fees are pay-
able at the cashier’s office while suits
may be rented at the Book Store.

PROMISING YEARUNG OUTFIT WILL

MEET FIRST TEST IN SCRIMMAGE

WITH VARSITY THIS AFTERNOON

Many Huskies Strive For Coveted Line Positions; Iwo
Numeral Men From Other Schools

Report

in | Reynolds of Omaha Central High, a
star prep player, also looks depend-
able.

Among the more weighty entrants
is Dubsky, a guard who tips the
beam almost incrediably at 274 pounds.
He is built close to the ground and
should develop into a real guard or
tackle. Then there is Weaver of
Jonesboro, Arkansas, six foot four in
height and 230 pounds in weight, a
scrapper at tackle or any line posi-
tion.

Stars In Backfield

Greer of Danville a 155 pound back
is fast on his feet and seems to be a
clever at picking out the holes. Saun-
derle of Lindblom is among the city
prep stars who have been doing good
work in the short weeks practise. Rey-
nolds an Omaha Central product is an-
other man who looks good.

Men wno have had experience’ at
the important position of center appear
to be lacking, however, although sev-
eral of the other linesmen have been
shifted and are training to fill the gap.
Otherwise the- team candidates are
welt distributed and many of them
have proved themselves capable to a
high degree.

Red shirt meets green shirt today
the first varsity freshman scrimmage
of the season. Fritz Crisler’s proteges
are all rounded into great shape and
declare that they will give the varsity
all that the veterans want in the way
of stiff workouts. Eighty-eight of the
yearling athletes have reported out for
practise and all are a husky looking
lot.

Two frosh numeral men from other
universities are among the aspirants
Bluhm, one of the regular backs on the
star Illini *29 team and Burgess of
Oak Park late of the Notre Dame
freshman outfit and also a numeral
man are both trying out for berths.
Bluhm played on the Hyde Park
squad several years ago in the days
of Red Woodward.

Line Looks Good

There are plenty of husky linemen
striving for perfection in the arts of
blocking and stopping line attacks by
the backfield. Two tentative lines,
each averaging near the 180 pound
mark have been formed and they bat-
tle daily under the tutelage of the line
coaches. McMeyer of Muskegon, Men-
denhall of Terre Haute, and Knowles
of Fargo have all been showing up
rather well in the preliminary clashes.

WE sat through our first session in
the Law school yesterday. Many of
the boys who specialized with us in
Phil Allen, Artie Scott, and the rest
opened their mouths in unison with
us as we heard gentle assignments of
three) and four hours per course and
learned that there had been advance
assignments for the first week. In
our 8 o’clock, too, everybody came
in on time and sat down as if they
actually were wide awake. We are
beginning too suspect that the great
and noble profession of the Law has
some nasty connection with Work,
Endeavor, and the other complica-
tions of this all too material world.

“Seek Whereabouts of Edward
Montgomery”—Daily Maroon head.
Poor boy, has he lost them?

AS a matter of fact, if there is
still any necessity for locating the
mysterious Mr. Montgomery, they
might follow Vic Wisner’s advice and
put a couple of rushing chairmen on
his trail. With men of their caliber
on the job even little Chester Gump
would by this time have been restored
to his Bims.

WE WENT TO SEE “The Poor
Nut” at the Cort theater last week,
and it was with some indignation
that we viewed the glorification of
Ohio and Wisconsin as the two
schools connected with the adven-
tures of the collegiate hero. “What,”
we cried, “What’s the matter with
Chicago. Ain’t it alright?” Later we
sat through some picture having to
do with a Mr. Brown at Harvard

—Miguel

WELL, even at that it might be a
good idea to appoint Mack Evan* as
an assistant coach!

So it goes, the authors of our col-
lege narratives insist upon register-
ing Frank Merriwell at Yale, Tom
Brown at Rugby, etc. With this rul-
ing literary tradition, we would have
had one hell of a time getting the
Rovers boys if they had ever grad-
uated from Putnam Hall. Tom Swift
probably, would have been sent to
Coyne Electrical school or something.
Anywhere, anything to keep from
giving us our fictitious heroes in fa-
miliar surroundings.

This editor feels that we have
been too patient for too long. We
should rise and demand the represen-
tation of “steel-sinewed youth” on
our own Midway, by our own C. &
A. school, in our own Trianon!

Furthermore, at the Cort we were
horrified with the discovery that our
own Chicago was represented among
the collegiate decorations outside
