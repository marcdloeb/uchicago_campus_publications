John K. Barton, of Kappa Sigma,
has been appointed head of a drive
among fraternity seniors for the re-
maining $8,000 needed to complete the
1926 class gift of $20,000.

Of the 500 members of the senior
class only 240 have thus far subscribed
to the drive, according to Seward Co-
vert, class treasurer. The $12,000 con-
tributed has been the donations of
women and non-fraternity men prin-
cipally,” declared Covert. "In order
to exhort the fraternity men to sub-
scribe to the drive we have decided
to reach them through personal con-
tact. Barton has appointed one grad-
uating senior in each fraternity to col-
lect the contributions of his fellow-
classmen in the house. With this
method it is hoped that the class quota
will be reached this week."

Appoint Committee

The committee selected by Barton
is as follows: Robert A. Carr, Delta

When the remaining $8,000 has been

over to the Board of Trustees of the
University to serve as a foundation for
the Ernest DeWitt Burton Memorial
Fund. This fund, which will eventual-

aside, and the interest from it will en-
dow a distinguished service profess-

two courses here this quarter: “En-
lightenment” given in English, and
“Modern Catholicism” in German.

In comment on his visit to Chicago,
Prof. Kreuger said, “I very much en-
joyed my stay at the University, and
will take best recollections back with
me of everything except the climate.
I hope to return in ’33 for the Cen-
tennial exposition.”

following the game the Seniors will
go to Ida Noyes Hall where the break-

Led Active Life

Tom Eek was born April’10, 1856,
in Prince Albert, Ontario, Canada.
Always athletically inclined, he start-
ed out when a boy as a rider of run-
ning horses. From the age of 16
to 21 he took up the driving of harn-
ess horses with unusual success. He
then became a noted cricket and la-
crosse player, a great ice-skater, and
also developed into a “world’s record
class” all-around athlete setting rec-
ords in walking, bicycle riding, and
several track and field events. In
1875 Eck ran a record quarter-mile
in 52 2-5 seconds at Toronto, Can-
ada. In 1876, using 12 pound dumb-
bells, he made a world’s record of
13 feet 2 inches in the standing broad
jump. In 1878, on a grass track he
walked 2 miles in 6 minutes, 57 sec-
onds. For a period of ten years
thei'eafter Tom was a champion bi-
cycle rider, and in 1886 was the first
to ride 100 miles on a high-wheel bi-
cycle inside 6 hours.

President Max Mason will be the

THE FARWELL DRESS

WE can t call it a tradition. We can’t very well urge you (if ybu
" are a senior) to wear a cap and gown this week on the ground
that seniors since time immemorial have worn caps and gowns Se-
nior Week. We can’t cite your forefathers. In this matter of tradi-
tions, you are sophisticated. You will look up the records, for all we
know, and find that before 1925 no senior was ever known to wear
a cap and gown Senior Week.

Nor can we argue that the school needs traditions, and that
this is your chance to start one. You have heard that logic before.
You have been urged to wear class toques, subscribe to The Phoenix
and say hello to the boys, all by way of starting traditions that
wouldn't start. If we want you to wear a cap and gown this week,
we must use some other argument.

Graduation from college is no ordinary event; and so the senior
in his last week is no ordinary creature. He is in a strangely esoteric
class. He is not like a guest checking out of a hotel, or a prisoner
pardoned by Governor Small. He is a Graduating Senior. He is
about to suffer a strange and important experience. eH wants nat-
urally, to announce his condition to his friends; and he should. The
cap and gown is a logical way of announcing it.

TABLE MANNERS

THE invigorating sport of throwing pennies seems to have definitely
fixed itself upon the college youth. He throws pennies at not
only anything, but everything. He nonchalantly tosses the coppers
to irritating after-dinner speakers. With equal nonchalance he
throws them at the best of campus talent, who take the stage, not
primarily to amuse him, but to entertain his guests and would-be
classmates. We wonder just why he does this.

IS COLLEGE WET?

To the Editor:

The results of the Prohibition Poll
taken in the various American colleges
received a rather disgusting misinter-
pretaton in the Maroon for June 3.
Having definite views on the subject,
and having helped count the ballots, I
now find it my desire to correct the

Maroon and interpret
ly.

It is true that only
the voters registered
present situation, but

the election fair-

that at least half of the students
voted are “dry.”

As for the commission of seven
that were elected, a brief survey

show that the odds are
dry. Smith and Darrow
professed wets elected,
their vote may be safely

that

men

will

undoubtedly
are the only
and part of
attributed to

popularity aside from the issue. Jane
Addams and Volstead, two outstand-

eight percent of *ng ^rys, were elected, while the other
in favor of the three, Hughes, Hoover, and Dawes,

it must be men-

tioned that an additional thirty-six per-
cent voted for a more stringent law or

while they have never been prominent
either way, are presumed to be “dry”
on account of their other political af-

more appropriations termed “dry.” On filiations. Thus, the commission seems

A COMPLETE COLLEGE
EDUCATION

I. Sequences

Ethics—term papers; blind dates;
dark lanes.

Fine Arts—a bedroom wall pinned
with magazine covers; bobbed hair in
a full coiffure.

Chemistry—“Bottcms up”; “Have
another?”; “Show me the way to go
home.”

Psychology—memorizing the foot- ;
ball songs; getting acquainted in Har-
per; oiling the profs.

Foreign languages—final exam ques-
tions; Harvard classics; “Can’t. Gotta .
study tonight.”

English—collegiate parlance; letter
to Daddy; pool room.

Hygiene—toothbrush; Y. M. C. A.

Physical .Education—crashing .the
gate; dark lanes.	—Bow Wow

WHAT with term papers and final
exams it was rather unfortunate that
these high school athletes were among
us at this time of the year. With such
religious application to books there is
always danger of giving the boys a
bad impression.

We were a-listcning over the radio
Memorial day. From somewhere came
an announcement—“Miss Blah-Blah
will now recite Flanders Fields.”

“let’s get another station. I hate them
real estate talks.”

THE LAST LAP

Just one more weeks, brothers, just
one little weeks

And exams will be over and done.

Just one fleeting week and you’ll tramp
with a pack

’Neath some blistering Western sun.

Just one more week, brothers, just one
little week

And your text-books can go in a case

While you start with a coterie of na-
tive*

From some African jumping-off place.

But why these poor dreams of the fu-
tur’s bright lure?

Let’s forget all the solace we seek.

For nothing can soften our books or
our profs—

There’s always this hopeless last week.

De odder day I was over to sea
Heinie Heinz the pigg sticker. He sed
he was gettin his work down two a
fine art. He can stik a pigg now and
it onlie grunts onct while it ust to
grunt twict. I agreed wit him that
that showed improvement alwrite. And
that just shows what kind of a guy
Heinie is, always lookin out four the
odder feller.

Pore Heinie was lookin pretty bad.
He tole me his womin had run off wit
de janiter and he was prettie blew
about it.

“Why don’t youse get after de guy
and kill him like a dogg?” I asks. “If
a feller did that two me I’d fix him.”

“Veil,” Heinie sed, “it makes me
pretty mad you bet but I woodn’t half
his blud on my hands. As long as
he taks my womin I dont care but
why dont he make her leave at home
