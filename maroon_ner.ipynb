This gives the\\nStudent Representative party a\\nseat on the council, which it would\\nnot otherwise have had.\\n\\nThe former by-law provided that\\nany party with 20 per cent of the\\nseats in SG was entitled to a com-\\nmittee-at-large.

Solomon thereupon con-\\ntested the ruling that the ballots\\nwere invalid and asked for the\\nrule which governed write-ins.\\n\\nThe rule governing write-ins,\\naccording to Jim Handler, chair-\\nman of the SG election and rules\\ncommittee, is as follows: “Any\\nwriting on a ballot shall render\\nthe ballot void.” This rule is in-\\nterpreted by the E and R commit-\\ntee to cover any and all writing.\\n\\nAnderson wants UC support:\\n\\nISL wins election\\n\\ntells why Douglas did not get here\\n\\nDouglas Anderson, Senator Douglas’ Illinois representative, denied\\ncategorically that he had ever spurned the support of the Independent\\n\\ndate, Solomon replied:\\n\\n“For personal reasons I did not\\nknow until late last week that I\\ncould spend any time in Student\\nGovernment.\\n\\n“In this context,” he added,\\n“writing means extraneous re-\\nmarks, defamatory remarks after\\na candidate’s name, and the like.\\nIt does not mean ‘no write-in votes\\nallowed.’ I assumed a democratic\\nelection would allow a voter to\\nvote for candidates of his choice,\\nwhether or not their names ap-\\npeared on the ballot.”\\n\\nAt the Student Government\\nmeeting last Tuesday, Jerry\\nZisook moved that Solomon be\\nseated as the third Med school\\ndelegate. Eli Stein immediately\\nchallenged that the motion was\\nout of order and suggested that\\nthe ruling could be brought up in\\nStudent - Faculty - Administration\\ncourt. The motion was declared\\nout of order by the chair.\\n\\nAward Fulbright\\nto Towle at last\\n\\nin 42 seat landslide\\n\\nvoters of Illinois and groups at the University of Chicago.\\n\\nAnderson maintained that the only reason that Douglas was unable\\nto appear on campus was that Douglas had previously scheduled meet-\\nings with the IVI in the fifth, second, and seventh wards that same\\n\\nFor the first time in Student Government history a political\\nparty captured all but three seats, as the Independent Students\\nLeague won 42 of 45 contested positions in the all-campus\\nelection last week.\\n\\nStudent Representative party candidates were elected to\\nfill one position in the college, one in the social sciences divi-\\n\\nsion, and one in the federated\\ntheological schools. There\\nwere no independent candi-\\ndates on this year’s slate.\\n\\nThis election, described by Clive\\nGray (ISL), last year’s SG presi-\\ndent, as the “biggest landslide a\\nparty ever had,” gave ISL control\\nof SG for the sixth time since\\nISL’s inception in 1948. •\\n\\nTwo seats in the assembly are\\nvacant. At the first SG meeting\\nheld last Tuesday, Al Fortier was\\nelected president, thereby relin-\\nquishing his seat as a delegate.\\nThe other vacancy is in the med-\\nical school, where only two of\\nthree seats were filled. SRP had\\nno candidates in this division.\\n\\nApproximately 32 per cent of\\nthe total student body cast about\\nfifteen hundred ballots. This vote\\nis 4% less than the 36% that\\nvoted in last year’s election, and\\n5% less than the record vote of\\n37% in 1952.

He said he was a founder\\nof the Americans for Democratic\\nAction and had worked on ar-\\nrangements that were to unite the\\n\\nIVI with the ADA.\\n\\nAnderson said that Fertig had\\n“gone off on his own hook” mak-\\ning arrangements for speakers on\\nthe strength of Douglas’ name be-\\nfore final arrangements had been\\nmade with Anderson.\\n\\nFertig and John Gilmore, who\\nmade calls to Barratt O\\'Hara,\\nDemocratic incumbent from the\\nsecond Congressional district, and\\nother notables scheduled to ap-\\npear at the rally, denied Ander-\\nson\\'s allegation.\\n\\nDr. Charlotte Towle, who\\nwas denied a Fulbright schol-\\narship by the foreign scholar-\\nship board in Washington in Sep-\\ntember of this year, has been\\ngranted the Fulbright upon re-\\nconsideration of the board.

It was forced into it,” con-\\n\\ncluded Sidney E. Mead, asso-\\nciate professor of history of\\nAmerican Christianity.\\n\\nMead spoke in the first of a\\nseries of four Walgreen founda-\\ntion lectures on “The shape of\\nProtestantism in America,” last\\nMonday. This first lecture, “From\\ncoercion to persuasion,” dealt\\nwith the development of relig-\\nious toleration in early colonial\\nAmerica.\\n\\nMead pointed out that early\\nProtestant aims to establish re-\\nligious coercion in the new world\\nwere frustrated by a variety of\\noutside influences. The self-inter-\\nest of individuals caused them to\\nforget the cries of the church\\nwhen it interfered with their per-\\nsonal ambitions; the vast spaces\\nof the new land made banishment\\nan enlargement of opportunity\\nrather than a confinement; and\\nEngland exerted pressure for a\\nmore tolerant attitude on relig-\\nious matters in New England.\\n\\nBesides these influences, “a\\nstrange alliance developed be-\\ntween the rationalists and the\\npietist revivalists which fore-\\nwarded the cause of religious\\n\\nC\\'shop drops all\\nhoars after five\\n\\nC-shop hours have again been\\nlimited to 7:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Lack of\\nstudent support was given by Rob-\\nert M.

This alli-\\nance was purely practical and not\\ntheoretical.

Ward\\nmanaging editor\\n\\nEditorial\\n\\nMAROON prints all news\\n\\nFor quite a while now it has become less fashionable to\\nrevile the Maroon for faults which range from a mere vicious\\nslanting of one story to hatching of vast conspiracies designed\\nto subvert the government (SG, of course).\\n\\nSo we are sorry to note that once again we have to defend ourselves\\nfor doing something which it is our duty and our stated purpose to\\ndo: provide an unbiased coverage for all the news in an unbiased\\nfashion, no matter how much the content or what we write might\\nplease or displease us.\\n\\nWe refer here to the story about Senator Paul H. Douglas which\\nappeared in the last issue of our paper. We are told that this story\\nis detrimental to the cause of the senator’s re-election.\\n\\nWe might remind our critics that the Maroon has not declared\\nitself either for or against Douglas, that even if we were supporting\\nthe senator editorially, the practice of printing or suppressing news\\nin line with orfe’s editorial policy i§ more suited to certain Chicago\\nmetropolitan papers than to ourselves. If the facts printed in the story\\nare the truth, then it is the actions of the persons involved that do,\\nor do not, reflect upon the various personalities.\\n\\nWe still propose to print all the news which we believe to be of\\ninterest to the student body. If this means stepping on the toes of\\nparticular interests, then we can only hope that the bones involved\\nare sound enough to stand it.\\n\\nfrom the Democratic and Republican\\nparties. In many cases, candidates and\\ntheir friends put tremendous pressures\\non members of our Board of Directors\\nin an attempt to Influence them. (You\\ncan be sure such pressures had no ef-\\nfect.) Never has the IVI endorsement\\nbeen so eagerly sought as this year.\\nMany candidates told us frankly that\\nif the usual close county vote prevails\\nthe IVI endorsement will determine the\\noutcome of several county races.\\n\\nNot only did Joseph Meek and Sena-\\ntor Douglas eagerly seek the IVI en-\\ndorsement, but Senator Douglas has\\ngiven full cooperation to our various\\ndistrict campaign committees. He has\\ngone out of his way to appear at some\\nof our public meetings. (Last February\\nhe flew from Washington to appear\\nwith Adlai Stevenson and Arch Carey\\nat our 10th anniversary celebration.\\n\\nAnd our members have enthusias-\\ntically supported Senator Douglas be-\\ncause^ of his intelligence and devotion,\\nbecause of his great fights on off-shore\\noil, his selfless attempts to wake up\\nAmericans to the need for economic plan-\\nning to avert depression, and his strong\\nsupport of the UN and economic aid to\\nunderdeveloped areas. It is a great rec-\\nord.\\n\\nWe hope that students, faculty and\\nall others associated with your great\\nuniversity will go on giving support to\\nAmerica’s Number One Senator, just as\\nthey have in the past.\\n\\nLeon M. Despres, Choirman\\n\\nJames V. Cunningham. Jr.\\n\\nExecutive Director I.V.I.\\n\\nagreed to fly in from Detroit for the\\noccasion and speak for the candidates.\\nMr. Cass initiated arrangements for\\nprocuring the Field House, and had re-\\nceived the consent of the proper admin-\\nistration personnel.\\n\\nBefore submitting a story on the\\nmeeting to the MAROON, on Wednes-\\nday, Oct. 13, I again checked with Miss\\nMalone at the Democratic Party. She\\nassured me that all publicity could be\\nissued. That evening Mr. Anderson got\\nin touch with me. He Informed me that\\nthe Democratic Party officials had made\\nan honest and innocent mistake in\\nscheduling Douglas for our proposed\\ngathering. The Democratic Party, he ex-\\nplained, has priority over all other\\nappointments, but this priority can only\\nbe utilized for Its ward meetings, and\\ncould not be extended to other groups\\nsuch as ours. Mr. Anderson then made\\nthose statements which have formed\\nthe basis of controversy on last Friday’s\\narticle.\\n\\nI cancelled the MAROON story which\\nannounced our proposed Mass Meeting,\\nand, in so doing, urged the editors of\\nthe MAROON to pursue the matter no\\nfurther. Nothing appeared that week.\\nThe following week, I was Interviewed\\nfor the story. By then, rumors and re-\\nporters had it that the remarks deroga-\\ntory to UC and to IVI were the Senator’s\\nand not those of his assistant. I urged\\nthe MAROON to make It clear that there\\nwas no reason to believe that the stated\\npositions were those of Mr. Douglas.\\nThere is still no evidence of the Sena-\\ntor’s holding such beliefs on the matter,\\n\\nand his welcoming of IVI support in the\\nprecincts and in his remarks at meet-\\nings would tend to indicate a difference\\nof opinion.\\n\\nMr. Anderson has subsequently issued\\nIdentical remarks to a women connected\\nwith the IVI on the North Side. This\\nwoman reported the comments to the\\nPolitical Action Personnel of the IVI\\nIVI has had the good sense to discuss\\nthis problem of a highly paced advisor\\nrejecting the support of liberals rather\\nthan denouncing those who report such\\ndiscouraging remarks.\\n\\nRalph D.

No such meeting\\nhad ever been screduled by Students for\\nDouglas. The Mr. Fertig that you men-\\ntioned is not and never has been a\\nmember of our organization.\\n\\nThe article went on to say that “the\\ndirector of the Speakers Bureau of the\\nDemocratic Party in Cook County had\\ntold members of the Students for Doug-\\nlas organization on campus to go ahead\\nwith publicity on Douglas’ appearance.”\\nNo member of Students for Douglas ever\\nspoke with the Speakers Bureau. We\\nhave had no contact with them, what-\\nsoever.\\n\\nThe article called Mr. Douglas Ander-\\nson the “administrative assistant to\\nDouglas.” Mr. Anderson does not and\\nnever has held this position. Mr. Ander-\\nson is the Illinois representative of the\\nSenator.\\n\\nThe article attributed to Mr. Anderson,\\nthe statement “Campaigning at the Uni-\\nversity of Chicago is the kiss of death”\\nand further stated that “he expressed\\nthe wish that people at the University\\nand the Independent Voters of Illinois,\\nwould not endorse Douglas,” allegedly\\nbecause the Senator wished to disasso-\\nciate himself from their “.radical poli-\\ntical elements.”\\n\\nMr. Andrson has assured us that he\\nhas never made such a statement to\\nany person, and that they are not his\\nviews. We can assure you that he has\\nnever made such a statement to Stu-\\ndents for Douglas. Anyone who knows\\nthe Senator and is familiar with his\\nrecord knows that they are not the views\\nof Senator Douglas. All one need do is\\npick up a phone and call Mr. Anderson\\n(as we did upon seeing the article), to\\nconfirm this.\\n\\nSenator Douglas has spoken in this\\ncampaign before numerous IVI meetings\\nand has the whole-hearted support of\\nthat organization. Only a week ago\\nTuesday he addressed an IVI meeting\\nat their Hyde Park headquarters at 1412\\nE. 55th Street.\\n\\nThe Senator has always been proud\\nof his more than 26 year association\\nwith the University of Chicago, and\\nhas openly welcomed the support of\\nits students and faculty, many of whom\\nare now actively campaigning for his\\nre-election.\\n\\nThis past Monday a representative of\\nDouglas* campaign headquarters appear-\\ned at a Students for Douglas meeting\\non campus to enlist the service of stu-\\ndents as poll-watchers, etc. The Sena-\\ntor’s wife, Mrs. Emily Taft Douglas,\\nformer Congresswoman - at - large from\\nIllinois spoke on campus this past Tues-\\nday at another Students-for-Douglas\\nsponsored meeting. Pick up any one of\\nthe numerous campaign pamphlets put\\nout by Douglas’ campaign headquarters\\nand you will discover what prominence\\nthe Senator’s long tenure at the U. of\\nC. is given. Are these the ways one\\ngoes about “disassociating Douglas”\\nname from the University?\\n\\nSumming up: the entire article In last\\nweek’s Maroon was from beginning to\\nend a long list of prevarications, some\\nof which, for the sake of conserving\\nspace, we have even neglected to men-\\ntion in this letter. The atricle was not\\nsubmitted by Students for Douglas, or by\\nany member thereof. Students for Doug-\\nlas knew nothing about the article until\\nthe Maroon published it. We are at a\\nloss to know why the name of our or-\\nganization was mentioned in the article.\\nIt sounded as though inspired and writ-\\nten by a “Student for Meek.”\\n\\n* Don Coss\\n\\nDavid A.

A few facts make this clear.\\n\\nBoth Joseph Meek and Senator Doug-\\nlas actively sought the endorsement of\\nthe IVI, as did ninety other candidates\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL HOUSE MOVIES\\n\\nAssembly Hall, Monday and Thursday Evenings at 8:30 P.M.\\n\\nMonday, Nov. 1 — ANA - TA - HAN (The Devil’s Pitchfork) (Japanese-\\nAmerican)\\n\\nThursday, Nov. 4—BELL FOR ADANO (American)\\n\\nEditor’s note: The story, ap-\\npearing in last week’s Maroon,\\nwas written from information\\nsupplied by Ralph Fertig, at that\\ntime, chairman of the citizen’s\\ncommittee for Barrett O’Hara.\\nDouglas Anderson was not avail-\\nable for comment up to the time\\nof publication.\\n\\nThe Maroon apologizes that this\\nwas not made clear in the story or\\nheadline as printed.

Both are ap-\\nproximajfcely the same magnitude in significance: Gaslight is based bn frankly melodramatic prem-\\nises, while La Ronde is from Schnitzler’s tracky psychological trifle.\\n\\nThey differ simply in that La Ronde is a distressingly poor film while Gaslight is a work of consum-\\n\\nmate craftmanship.\\n\\nThe problem of understanding\\nwhy one film is a .failure and the\\nother is not, in this case, resolves\\nitself into seeing what character-\\nistic stylistic elements, what ap-\\nproach to subject matter and the\\nfilm medium each director has\\nutilized.\\n\\nOphuls doomed himself to al-\\nmost certain failure by the use of\\ndevices that just never seem to be\\nconvincing on the screen.\\n\\nChief among there was the use\\nof a “Mr. Fate” character to fur-\\nther the action. And it wasn’t\\nmerely the off-key- singing and\\nhorrendous posturing of Mr. Wal-\\nbrook that caused this.\\n\\nPlacement of the action in the\\ncontext of a stage-filmic-historical\\nnever-never-land betrays the most\\nfundamental principle of convinc-\\ning cinema.\\n\\nThe basis for Dickinson’s style\\nlies in the realization that any\\ncharacters or devices interposed\\nbetween direct visual presentation\\nof the action tend to destroy the\\nunity and rhythm of the film.\\n\\nDickinson is a master of using\\nobjects in a way that illuminates\\nand interacts with the world of\\ncharacter and action.\\n\\nIn the opening sequence, the\\nslashed furniture a demented\\nmurderer leaves in the wake of\\nhis search reflects the chaos of\\nhis mind, the frenzy of his action,\\nand the condition of his victim,\\nnow dying as just such a bundle\\nof useless rubbish.\\n\\nAgain in the flickering of the\\n\\ngaslight as the husband leaves the\\nattic we feel the emotional flut-\\ntering of his wife’s fears, doubts\\nand anguish as she lies on hei\\' bed.\\nIn themselves trifles, these de-\\nvices become significant when\\nthey make up the complex seam\\nless texture of the film. Perhaps\\nit is this element of not being told\\neverything, of participating in\\nmore than a passive way, that\\nsets the difference between good\\nand poor cinema.\\n\\nF. G.

Though her\\npassing grieved me, it was some satisfaction to be able to grant her\\nlast wish — to be buried at sea — which is no small task when you\\nlive in Pierre, South Dakota.\\n\\nWith the dinner guests fed and the cook laid to her watery rest,\\nI put out the cat and turned to the problem of Homecoming.\\n\\nFirst of all, let us define Homecoming. Homecoming is a weekend\\nwhen old graduates return to their alma maters to see a football\\ngame, ingest great quantities of food and drink, and inspect each\\nother\\'s bald spot!#\\n\\nThis occasion is marked by the singing of old songs, the slapping\\nof old backs, and the frequent utterance of such outcries as “Harry,\\nyou old polecat!” or \"Harry, you old rooster!” or \"Harry, you old\\nwombat!” or \"Harry, you old mandrill!” All old grads are named\\nHarry.\\n\\nDuring Homecoming the members of the faculty behave with\\nunaccustomed animation. They laugh and smile and pound backs\\nand keep shouting, \"Harry, you old retriever!” These unscholariy\\nactions are performed in the hope that the old grads, in a transport\\nof bonhomie, will endow a new geology building.\\n\\nThe old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time on\\nSaturday, their backs are so sore, their eyes so bleary, and their\\nlivers so sluggish that it is impossible to get a kind word out of\\nthem, much less a new geology building. \"Hmphh!” they snort as\\nthe home team completes a 101 yard march to a touchdown. \"Call\\nthat football? Why, back in my day they’d have been over on the\\nfirst down. By George, football was football back in those days —\\nnot this namby pamby girls game that passes for football today.\\nWhy, look at that bench. Fifty substitutes sitting there! Why, in\\nmy day, there were eleven men on a team and that was it. When you\\nbroke a leg, you got taped up and went right back in. Why, I remem-\\nber the big game against State. Harry Wallaby, our star quarter-\\nback, was killed in the third quarter. I mean he was pronounced dead.\\nBut did that stop old Harry? Not on your tintype! Back in he went\\nand kicked the winning drop-kick in the last four seconds of play,\\ndead as he was. Back in my day, they played fool bull, by George!”\\n\\nEverything, say the old grads, was better back in their day —\\neverything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the old\\ngrads has to admit that back in his day they never had a smoke like\\ntoday’s vintage Philip Morris — never anything so mild and pleasing,\\nday in day out, at study or at play, in sunshine or in shower, on\\ngrassy bank or musty taproom, afoot or ahorse, at home or abroad,\\nany time, any weather, anywhere.\\n\\nI take up next another important aspect of Homecoming — the\\ndecorations in front of the fraternity house. Well do I remember\\none Homecoming of my undergraduate days. The game was against\\nPrinceton. The Homecoming slogan was \"Hold That Tiger!” Each\\nfraternity house built a decoration to reflect that slogan, and on\\nthe morning of the game a group of dignitaries toured Fraternity\\nRow to inspect the decorations and award a prize for the best.\\n\\nThe decoration chairman at our house was an enterprising young\\nman named Rex Sigafoos, nephew of the famous lepidopterist. Rex\\nsurveyed Fraternity Row, came back to our house and said, \"All\\nthe other houses are building cardboard cages with cardboard tigers\\ninside of them. We need to do something different — and I’ve got it.\\nWe’re going to have a real cage with a real tiger inside of it —a\\nsnarling, clawing, slashing, real live tiger!”\\n\\n\"Crikey!” we breathed. \"But where will you get him?”\\n\\n\"I’ll borrow him from the zoo,” said Rex, and sure enough, he did.\\n\\nWell sir, you can imagine what a sensation it was on Home-\\ncoming morning. The judges drove along nodding politely at card-\\nboard tigers in cardboard cages and suddenly they came to our house.\\nNo sham beast in a sham cage here! No sir! A real tiger in a real\\ncage — a great striped jungle killer who slashed and roared and\\nsnarled and dashed himself against the bars of his cage with mani-\\nacal fury.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that we would have easily taken first prize\\nhad not the tiger knocked out the bars of the cage and leaped into\\nthe official car and devoured Mr. August Schlemmer, the governor\\nof the state, Mr. Wilson Ardsley Devereaux, president of the uni-\\nversity, Dr. O.

       " 'Well, what with company coming for dinner and the cook down\\nwith a recurrence of breakbone fever, I could not tarry to answer\\ntheir questions. “Read my column next week,” I cried to them.\\n“I’ll tell all about Homecoming.” With that I brushed past and\\nraced home to baste the mallard and apply poultices to the cook,\\nwho, despite my unending ministrations, expired quietly during the\\nnight, a woman in her prime, scarcely 108 years old. Though her\\npassing grieved me, it was some satisfaction to be able to grant her\\nlast wish — to be buried at sea — which is no small task when you\\nlive in Pierre, South Dakota.',\n",
       " 'With the dinner guests fed and the cook laid to her watery rest,\\nI put out the cat and turned to the problem of Homecoming.',\n",
       " \"First of all, let us define Homecoming. Homecoming is a weekend\\nwhen old graduates return to their alma maters to see a football\\ngame, ingest great quantities of food and drink, and inspect each\\nother's bald spot!#\",\n",
       " 'This occasion is marked by the singing of old songs, the slapping\\nof old backs, and the frequent utterance of such outcries as “Harry,\\nyou old polecat!” or \"Harry, you old rooster!” or \"Harry, you old\\nwombat!” or \"Harry, you old mandrill!” All old grads are named\\nHarry.',\n",
       " 'During Homecoming the members of the faculty behave with\\nunaccustomed animation. They laugh and smile and pound backs\\nand keep shouting, \"Harry, you old retriever!” These unscholariy\\nactions are performed in the hope that the old grads, in a transport\\nof bonhomie, will endow a new geology building.',\n",
       " 'The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time on\\nSaturday, their backs are so sore, their eyes so bleary, and their\\nlivers so sluggish that it is impossible to get a kind word out of\\nthem, much less a new geology building. \"Hmphh!” they snort as\\nthe home team completes a 101 yard march to a touchdown. \"Call\\nthat football? Why, back in my day they’d have been over on the\\nfirst down. By George, football was football back in those days —\\nnot this namby pamby girls game that passes for football today.\\nWhy, look at that bench. Fifty substitutes sitting there! Why, in\\nmy day, there were eleven men on a team and that was it. When you\\nbroke a leg, you got taped up and went right back in. Why, I remember the big game against State. Harry Wallaby, our star quarterback, was killed in the third quarter. I mean he was pronounced dead.\\nBut did that stop old Harry? Not on your tintype! Back in he went\\nand kicked the winning drop-kick in the last four seconds of play,\\ndead as he was. Back in my day, they played fool bull, by George!”',\n",
       " 'Everything, say the old grads, was better back in their day —\\neverything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the old\\ngrads has to admit that back in his day they never had a smoke like\\ntoday’s vintage Philip Morris — never anything so mild and pleasing,\\nday in day out, at study or at play, in sunshine or in shower, on\\ngrassy bank or musty taproom, afoot or ahorse, at home or abroad,\\nany time, any weather, anywhere.',\n",
       " 'I take up next another important aspect of Homecoming — the\\ndecorations in front of the fraternity house. Well do I remember\\none Homecoming of my undergraduate days. The game was against\\nPrinceton. The Homecoming slogan was \"Hold That Tiger!” Each\\nfraternity house built a decoration to reflect that slogan, and on\\nthe morning of the game a group of dignitaries toured Fraternity\\nRow to inspect the decorations and award a prize for the best.',\n",
       " 'The decoration chairman at our house was an enterprising young\\nman named Rex Sigafoos, nephew of the famous lepidopterist. Rex\\nsurveyed Fraternity Row, came back to our house and said, \"All\\nthe other houses are building cardboard cages with cardboard tigers\\ninside of them. We need to do something different — and I’ve got it.\\nWe’re going to have a real cage with a real tiger inside of it —a\\nsnarling, clawing, slashing, real live tiger!”',\n",
       " '\"Crikey!” we breathed. \"But where will you get him?”',\n",
       " '\"I’ll borrow him from the zoo,” said Rex, and sure enough, he did.',\n",
       " 'Well sir, you can imagine what a sensation it was on Homecoming morning. The judges drove along nodding politely at cardboard tigers in cardboard cages and suddenly they came to our house.\\nNo sham beast in a sham cage here! No sir!
